Oh, my God, we did it!
We just got married. Right there!
Is that your ring?
We're off to a good start.
-And, you sure you're not pregnant?
we got a room upstairs.
I mean, I'll blow off
this party right now. I'll do it!
Okay, you guys,
that ceremony was so beautiful.
Was it?! Was it perfect?!
Our two best friends just got married.
We are so blessed to be able
to share in this incredible joy.
That is so true.
Mon, is it too late to switch
from chicken to steak?
I'm so happy for you guys.
Just give me a sec to change film.
I know I'm not supposed to know,
but I do and I'm so excited for you.
-What's going on?
-Monica's pregnant.
Oh, my God. Is that why
-Oh, slow swimmers?
What?! What do you mean?
You're not pregnant?
-You didn't tell anybody I was, did you?
-No.
I'll be right back.
You. Take a lot of pictures.
Why don't we get a shot of Monica
to change before the party.
-I can't. I don't have any other
clothes here. -Find some, please.
Anything that doesn't say,
"I died tragically in France."
-Fine!
because you got blood on his dress.
Why don't we see the bride and
the groom, and the bridesmaids.
Hey, Mon, why'd you tell the guys
that you weren't pregnant?
-Because I'm not.
because it's your day.
-I didn't wanna steal your thunder.
-So you told people I was pregnant?
Does this look like a conversation
I want to remember?
-Who's the father?
-Why not?
I can't say because he's famous.
Oh, my God. Who is it?
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
Okay, okay, it's James Brolin.
James Brolin is the father of my baby.
As in Barbra Streisand's husband
James Brolin?
What?!
Well, he never said that to me.
Monica, if you step away,
we'll get Chandler and the bridesmaids.
How about just the bridesmaids?
I am the groom.
-Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Thank you for that.
I can't deal with the stress quite yet.
Instead you told me
Monica was pregnant?
You said she was.
-I know.
I could only think of two names
him and Ed Begley Jr.
-Then I remembered he's gay, so..
-Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
Really?
Congratulations!
Look who's married!
control, I'm just gonna..
I just wanted you to know
that you have made us happier
You have given us more joy..
I'm not pregnant.
What?
I'm not pregnant.
Oh, well.
But I did still get married today.
Whatever.
Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me
great pleasure to introduce to you:
Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing.
-Before we go out there, I got a present.
-What?
For the last six weeks. I wanted this
to be a moment you'd never forget.
That is so sweet.
So would you care to join me
in our first dance as husband and wife?
Yes.
-What's the matter?
-Not well.
Well, the good news is,
I don't think anyone's looking at us.
So are you ready to talk about it?
No.
Now?
No!
-We'll talk about something else then.
-Thank you.
Who's the father?
Honey, I haven't told him yet..
so, until I do, I don't think
-Phoebe!
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop.
Is it Ross? It's Ross, isn't it?
-Oh, my God, it's Joey!
-Stop it. Okay?
I am not gonna tell you
until I tell him.
At least we know it's a him.
Oh, sweet Lord.
I'm sorry, okay?
What's more important
The way I'm dressed,
or being with you today?
Honey, I'm not gonna even pretend
I was listening. Hey! Hey!
I'm Ross, I don't believe we met.
I always kind of hated it.
Come on! Mona Lisa.
Mona...
Llegglachen.
The famous botanist.
Oh, no, she's..
Well, she's dead now, but..
Supposedly she was once
quite the hottie of the plant world.
Really?
-See, I never knew about her.
who likes my name.
Yes, there will.
Guess what, Molly Gilbert. You've
just been bumped up to table one.
And if it's all right with you,
I'll take your place at table six.
Martin Llegglachen.
That's better. Now, just bend your arms
to really put your ass into it.
Who's slippery now?
Isn't that just the best feeling?
Rubbing a fork on the bottom of your shoe?
Chandler, darling, look,
my date has finally arrived.
I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.
-Thank you.
Dennis is a dear old friend..
and a fantastic lover.
Are my ears bleeding?
Don't mind Chandler.
He's always been shy.
Oh, you're right.
Bravo, Dennis.
Thanks for pleasing my mother so.
I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony.
a new Broadway show.
I don't believe we've met.
Joey Tribbiani.
-Dennis Phillips.
-I've admired your work for years.
-You've done some really amazing stuff.
I'm gonna go get myself a drink.
I'll be back in a moment.
Okay. You stop.
Dennis Phillips. That's great.
How did you guys meet?
-Well, it's a funny story.
-Funny, "ha-ha"? Or funny:
Thank you. If everyone will please
-No. Nine.
See, before, when you showed it to me,
you held it that way..
which was misleading.
Hello.
Will you see if your mom can give
my resume to Dennis Phillips?
Well, they've kind of locked themselves in
then I would've done it all.
Film, television and theater.
The only thing left would be radio.
But that's just for ugly people.
-What size shoes do you wear?
-Eleven, ¨ö.
My shoes give me a problem on the
where I left those.
-Those aren't  ¨ö.
-Okay, fine, I'm a !
I have surprisingly small feet. But
the rest of me is good. I'll show you.
Who am I kidding?
-Let's not talk about that right now.
-This is so huge.
-Sure, but as big as your wedding?
Of course not. Nothing is.
Between me and you,
in this day and age..
how dumb do you have to be
Everyone wears what they're supposed to..
and one of those little guys
just gets through.
-How?
-I don't know. Maybe they have tools.
Well, I talked to her, and she's
raise it on her own.
-Well, maybe that's really brave.
-Maybe.
I just hope she realizes how hard
it's gonna be.
Maybe she hasn't really thought it
How is she gonna juggle work?
Does she realize she's not gonna have
a date again for the next, like,  years?
I don't know.
Are you okay?
I'm just thinking about Phoebe.
Poor, knocked-up Phoebe.
-Champagne?
with my lover James Brolin.
-Oh, really?
-Apparently, he is married to some singer.
But he said he'd leave her for me.
And I said, "James Brolin, are you sure?"
-James Brolin said..
-I don't know how I feel.
This is all happening so fast. I have to make
all these decisions that I don't wanna make.
Someone just take this away from me!
-Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
-What?!
When I got pregnant with the triplets,
Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
How many ways are there to do that?
I'm just saying, don't freak out
until you're  percent sure.
All right, I'll take it again
when I get home.
I can wait until then.
Oh, this is such a good party.
-No, this your wedding.
You're not gonna be able to have fun
until we know. Do it as a present to me.
Okay, thank you.
-I'll run out and get you one.
-You girls are so great.
-Wait a minute. Who's the father?
That could be my present!
-I just gave you peeing on a stick.
-See, this is why you register.
It was the chair again. Okay?
I'm not doing it!
Dad. Can't you go back to your table?
No. Apparently little Molly Gilbert is
You know what?
-Would you like to dance?
-Sure.
Great.
-Dr. Geller.
-I wasn't farting!
A little game from our table.
Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?
Maybe later. Right now,
letting you go first.
I'd be happy to.
You are very sweet.
Yes, I am.
In fact, let's try my special way.
You can dance on my feet.
-Sure.
Keep dancing.
And the world will never know.
Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
I told him how talented you were
and all about Days of our Lives.
You don't tell a Broadway guy that!
Now he thinks I'm just a soap actor.
But you're not just a soap actor.
You are a soap actor
what kind of range I have.
Don't move.
It's like he's running
on tiny little pegs.
-Thank you.
-No, thank you, Miranda.
-Melinda.
-Oh, were you watching?
Can I go next?
Of course you can. Hop on.
Okay, but I get to hop on after her.
-I am so gonna score.
-What?
I like your bow.
I'd like to propose a toast
to Monica and Chandler..
the greatest couple in the world,
getting married, I was a little angry.
I was like, "Why, God? Why?
How can you take them away from me!"
But then I thought back over all our
memories together. Some happy memories.
And there were some sad memories.
I'm sorry.
And some scared memories.
And then I realized
in many dialects..
and has training in stage combat
and is willing to do partial nudity.
To the happy couple.
-Thank you.
-That was very nice, Ashley.
-Can we do it again?
-I'm next.
-That's okay, you can dance with her first.
-Are you sure?
-So, what's your name?
-Gert.
That's pretty.
What are you doing there, Gert?
Dancing on your feet
-I'm trying.
Faster. You're not going fast enough.
Maybe I should stand on your feet!
So did you happen to catch
my toast up there?
-Oh, my God. That was for my benefit?
-There was a little something for everyone.
-I know you're casting for this new show.
didn't see it up there, just try me.
It's an all Chinese cast.
Can you be Chinese?
-Well, I'm not proud of this, but..
-Oh, my God. Please don't!
-Ready to get back to the dance floor?
-No. No, I won't.
Do you know why
I took all those lessons?
I didn't want you to be embarrassed
to be seen on the dance floor..
with some clumsy idiot.
Oh, sweetie,
But it doesn't matter, all right?
I married you.
No matter what you do,
I'm gonna come home with you, okay?
So I'm gonna dance on my wedding night
with my husband. Come on.
But I'll tell you, that's the last time I buy
-Why?
You stole my moves!
Oh, Chandler, you're quite the dancer!
-Thanks, Mrs. Geller.
-Oh, come on, you can call me Mom.
Really?
I will.
Sorry, Mom.
-How much longer?
- seconds.
Thirty seconds, okay..
Did I miss it?
I want you to know that
-You do. Okay.
It's time.
Go ahead, Rach.
Wait. You know what? I can't
look at it. Somebody else tell me.
It's negative.
-What?
-It's negative.
Well, there you go.
That is.. That's great.
the financial aspects, all that..
This is so just the way
that this was supposed to be.
Then, great.
God, this is so stupid.
How can I be upset
over something I never had?
-It's negative?
-It's not negative, it's positive.
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I lied before.
-Now you know how you really feel about it.
-That's a risky little game.
Are you really gonna do this?
Yeah.
I'm gonna have a baby.
I'm gonna have a baby.
I'm gonna have a baby!
-With who?
room, soak your feet. You'll be okay.
-Thank you.
-That is so sweet!
No, I mean it. There are so few
genuinely nice guys out there.
Tell me about it. I feel like I'm
-Yeah.
Wait a minute! No!
I'm the nice one!
I'm the one that danced
with the kids all night. I..
How small are your feet?!
Listen, sir, for the last time,
I don't care what the computer says.
We did not take a bag of Mashuga Nuts
Dr. Do-Me-A-Little.
-Joey, were you in our room last night?
-No.
I was told the name of the movie
would not appear on the bill.
-We're checking out of the bridal suite.
Now I'm just someone's wife.
And I'm the happiest guy in the world.
Honey, don't be upset. We still have
so much to look forward to.
Yeah, right.
-We got the honeymoon.
-That's not till Thursday.
-The wedding pictures.
from the tables.
That's true.
I knew I married you for a reason!
Tell you what, I will go get them
developed, and you can go home.
-What? What did you take a picture of?
Has he checked out yet?
Are you joking?
Checkout is not till noon.
-And he has a good  minutes left.
-So?
So Ross had never checked out of a room
we got a late checkout.
He got so excited,
it was the best sex we ever had.
Until he screamed out "Radisson"
at the end.
Okay, well, I'm gonna get Ross,
-Thanks.
Champagne, strawberries..
Oh, my God! I can't believe Chandler
ordered porn on our wedding night.
Yeah, that's sad.
Mashuga Nut?
I have six minutes left!
It's me.
Soaps, shampoos.
It's built into the price of the room.
Yeah, but you don't need..
What is this?
Thread.
Score!
-Where are the disposable cameras?
-What cameras?
-Last night I asked you to take them.
Right before we cut the cake, I said..
Yeah, you asked me
if I could do you a favor.
Then my Uncle Murray came up to you
and handed you a check.
Then you said, "Why is it called
and my Uncle Murray looked at me like
-So you don't have the cameras?
-No, sorry.
So, what? They're gone?
Monica's gonna freak!
I'm sure they're here somewhere.
-In three minutes.
Are you gonna open the presents
without Chandler?
No! I'm just..
They're calling out to me. This
little guy even crawled up in my lap.
Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just
when you look into it..
you see yourself as an old woman.
A tiny salt shaker!
Oh, my God, for tiny salt!
Oh, wow! Okay. Well, that was fun.
That was fun.
Okay, I'll just wait for Chandler
to open up the rest of them.
Although, you know, this is part
a present. What do you think?
I guess it's okay to open one more if it's
part of a set. It's probably this one.
Or this one!
-How are you? Got any morning sickness?
-The guys don't know yet, do they?
Joey and Ross don't know anything.
Chandler does still think I'm pregnant.
He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling
or offered to carry my bags.
I feel bad for the woman
who ends up with him.
After you, of course.
Don't worry. You only have to be
That tall guy on the first floor?
-No!
-What? I think he's cute.
-Then you have his baby.
-Believe me, I'm trying.
It's so weird.
what's gonna happen.
You're just gonna knock on his door
and change his life forever.
You're like Ed McMahon,
except without the big check.
Or the raw sexual magnetism.
Yeah, well, I guess
God, this guy doesn't have a clue.
He's just walking down the street thinking,
"I had sex with Rachel Greene. I rock!"
Then, bam! He's a father,
everything's different.
It's only different if he wants it to be.
to make.
Now he's walking around thinking,
"Do I want to be a dad?" Then, bam!
What was that "bam"?
I don't know.
He's hit by a bus, or something.
Joey, what would you do if someone you
an accent? I gotta make a call.
Should have never walked
into that Sunglass Hut!
It's not you!
You didn't get anybody pregnant.
Why would you scare me like that?
You're gonna have a baby?
Yes, I am.
Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!
-Wait a minute, who's the father?
-You don't know him.
It's not important. He wants nothing
track him down and kick his ass!
-David Linn.
-David Linn!
-Who's David Linn?
-Some guy from my gym. Little annoying.
-Chandler?
-Yes.
That's why I'm under the table,
celebrating.
I checked in the lost and found. I talked
to the manager. No one's turned them in.
Great. Those cameras were the only thing
Why is she so depressed?
All my energy is going
into not asking that question.
-I can't believe I screwed this up!
-I'm sorry, man.
Here's a thought.
plenty of dressed-up people.
Are you suggesting
we dance our troubles away?
No, I'm saying we buy more of these
at the gift shop..
throw our tuxes back on
not to get anybody's faces.
Are you serious?
I'm thinking about
your new bride at home.
Do you want to start your life together
by letting her down?
Marriage advice? Really?
I'm telling you,
-I don't know. Monica picked them.
-What about the chairs?
-Those too.
-The place settings?
-Her.
-What did you do?
-Not yet.
Then what are you doing here?
Are you about to do it?
Is it Gunther?
-It's not Gunther!
-Thank God. Because that hair on a baby?
The father is not here, okay?
-Why not?
I was walking down the street, thinking,
"I'm gonna tell the father." And then, bam!
Bus?
No, you! You freaked me out.
You kept saying how huge this all is.
But it is huge.
I know. But I was just thinking about
for the father.
You're thinking about this way too much.
Just tell him and get it over with.
It's like ripping off this Band-Aid,
quick and painless. Watch.
Oh, mother of..!
See?
-Are we opening presents?
You have to do me a favor.
No matter what I say,
no matter what I do..
please, do not let me open
another present. Okay?
Give me one more.
Oh, good, you're here.
-All right.
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.
I've always felt that you
and I have a special bond.
So..
Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
Oh, my God!
Oh, yeah, I'll marry you.
-You can't marry him!
-I can and I will.
She's not pregnant.
Rachel's the one who's pregnant.
Oh, my God!
He'd notice when you didn't
have a baby in nine months!
It's Joey!
I love you.
Wait, I can't believe it!
-There's a dude?
Who is it?
About a month ago
this guy spent the night with Rachel.
I didn't see who it was, but..
Was that story over?
The guy left this.
Oh, my God!
I know who the father is.
People have got
Come closer.
Nice aftershave.
If you want some,
I've got eight mini bottles in my bag.
-Excuse me, could you take a picture of us?
-Of course.
Would you take one of us?
Yeah, sure.
Click.
-It didn't click.
-Why won't you take our picture?
Oh, yeah. I'll take your picture.
Your finger was covering the lens.
Who are you, Ansel Adams?
Get out of here!
Look, I feel really bad about
how I freaked you out before..
so I asked the father to meet you here
How do you even know who the father is?
I may play the fool at times..
but I'm more than a pretty blond girl
with an ass that won't quit.
I believe this belongs
to the father of your baby..
Oh, God. He's in there right now?
You can turn around, or you can go rip
-Are you sure?
-Phoebe!
-Okay. Sorry.
Hey, Rach.
Why don't you go up on-stage.
I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.
Will the owner of a  Buick LeSabre
-Yes.
-A green LeSabre?
-Yes!
-I'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
-Yes, green-blue.
Well, go. Go move it!
Ready for the last picture?
she wants to tell you.
And I believe that
this is your red sweater.
No, this is my red sweater.
Oh, no.
Could I get anyone a coffee?
Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
What's going on, Rach?
Nothing.
Phoebe kind of made a mistake.
But you do wear that sweater a lot.
I was immature, but I've grown up.
I think we should get back together.
It's just not the right time.
It is the right time.
I'm ready for more.
Come on, Rach.
Let's give it another try.
I'm having a baby.
-You can go.
any of these got opened!
-You opened them all?
-I know, I am a terrible person.
Chandler's never gonna trust me
with anything ever again.
You got my parents' gift.
-What is that?
-What did Tag say?
Tag is not the father.
And Joey knows now?
I do, Rach, I do.
And I am so happy for you.
Wow, you didn't even try
-I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.
No matter what this guy says,
you're not gonna be alone in this.
-I'm not?
-No. Listen..
It's a scary world out there,
this special bond, you know?
-Rachel Greene, will you marry me?
-What?
-What?
-What?!
-Pheebs, give me the ring back.
But I'm not looking for a husband.
I understand.
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go and lie down.
What? I proposed to you.
It balances out.
I can't say that didn't hurt.
But I'll take you back, Joey Tribbiani.
-Listen, about that, I only offered..
-Great.
We're hanging in the kitchen.
Let's stay in the kitchen.
-It's picture time.
-You're gonna love these.
Here's a picture of Ross.
And that's me.
And that's me and Ross.
And here's a picture of our first kiss
the cameras in one of our bags.
Didn't see that coming.
So this isn't a picture
of our first kiss..
but it is a picture
of my first kiss with this lady.
Which, by the look on your face, I'm sure
-Good idea.
You opened all the presents without me?
We were gonna do that together.
You kissed another woman?!
-Call it even?
-Okay.
-I'm gonna go get these in some water.
charge me for some dirty movie..
and a bag of Mashuga Nuts,
they got another thing coming!
Hey, my sweater!
I've been looking for this
for, like, a month.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
-Hey, how you doing?
-Right back at you.
-It's crazy about Rachel.
-Well, she's one crazy lady.
-So whose is it?
-I don't know, some Italian guy.
Come on, read your own label.
on our honeymoon?
Yeah, I am.
That's right, get it out of your system
while we're alone.
-Hey. We came to say goodbye.
-Yeah. Have a great honeymoon.
-Thanks.
I couldn't find, though, was your Speedo.
Speedo? I don't have a Speedo.
I'm gonna go pack my regular,
long bathing suit.
Good, you're still here! I wanted
to tell you to have a good honeymoon.
Thank you!
And I also wanted you guys to know
-How? How do you know?
It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!
I so wanted Ross to know first.
But I am so relieved that you guys know!
That is so great. And I'm gonna be
your baby's aunt!
I know.
Me too!
And I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.
-You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
Give me some advice on how to tell Ross.
What were you gonna say?
I was gonna tell him that I'm gonna have it,
and he can be as involved as he wants.
Well, that sounds good.
Yeah, but, you know, how do I start?
I mean, what's the first thing that I say?
-Okay, great. Thanks.
Rachel and Ross are going to have a baby.
What?! I didn't even know that..!
Why didn't you tell me?
Why am I talking like this?
-I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
-What?!
What?!
I am an excellent secret-keeper.
-No, no, Joey.
I'm not gonna tell you, because
I am an excellent secret-keeper.
-You'll tell me later?
-You already know.
It's so romantic to send people off
married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby.
-Maybe you and I should do something.
-All in good time, my love. All in good time.
Shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment.
Well, you can let me in later, right?
No, I don't have a key.
-Why would they take away our keys?
Maybe they don't trust us.
They let me keep my key the last time
they were out of town.
The time you broke the ketchup bottle
and cleaned it with Monica's guest towels?
-Hey, I washed those.
-I have stuff in there too.
-What stuff?
-Monica's chicken parm. I'll take care of it.
Hey, Mr. Treeger? It's Joey Tribbiani.
Listen, I need to get into Monica and
Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency!
Gas leak. Oh, and bring garlic bread.
-Hey, did Monica and Chandler take off yet?
Nassau Fossil and Natural History Museum.
There goes the honeymoon.
-Did Rachel find you?
-No, why?
She was looking for you.
Well, I guess I'll catch up
with her later.
-She really wanted to talk to you now.
gonna tell anybody this, but..
About a month ago,
Rachel and I slept together.
And?
Wow, I thought you'd be
a little more shocked.
Oh, sorry. And?!
Well, we said we'd just do it
start things up again.
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
-Why? What else could it be?
-Oh, wow, I don't feel well.
I'm telling you, that's what it is.
No wonder she was looking at me
all funny during the wedding.
She didn't say anything to you?
-Maybe it's something you ate.
-Yeah, I guess I should.
Man, you know what I have to realize?
Maybe I'm not the type of guy
women can have just one night with.
You know, they always seem
to want a little bit more.
I should remember that.
Next.
-They're kissing. Let's just go around them.
in an orderly fashion.
Next.
Hi. Can you do that and walk?
Because she said, "Next."
Sorry, we didn't hear you.
We're on our honeymoon.
Let me see what I can do. There
because they're on their honeymoon!
-Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
-We are on our honeymoon.
Grab my ass.
-Next.
-Hi. Sorry, I almost didn't hear you.
You know, I'm just so in love with my
-Thanks.
Okay, Mr. Bing, you'll be in J,
and Mrs. Bing, you're in K.
We're on our honeymoon, so can you do
your little thing and bump us to first class?
I'm sorry, all the first-class seats are
she'd have given us those tickets! Damn it!
J and K, any chance
those aren't together?
I still can't believe they took away my
key. I mean, you trust me with yours.
Of course I do!
at the key-shining place.
-What the hell is that?
-I don't know.
Treeger, what are you doing?
-You said there was a gas leak.
-Why not use your key?
By the time I found it on this thing,
I manage, people will ask questions.
Come on, hurry up!
Well, we could have done that.
Look at that! They're going
into the first-class lounge.
-Do you know what they have in there?
-No.
Me neither. We have to get in!
-Just act like you belong.
-Sir, may I see your tickets, please?
Yes, of course.
Would you move your thumb?
I can't see the seat number.
That's all right.
I have it memorized. It's A.
-Sir, this isn't a first-class ticket. I'm sorry.
to ask you to leave.
Fine.
Go, go!
-Hi.
-Hi.
Hi.
I think there's something
that we really need to talk about.
I think we do. Why don't we go inside.
-Look, I know why you're here.
from any embarrassment..
I think maybe I should talk first.
-Okay.
-Okay?
Ross and Rachel.
Rachel and Ross.
That's been one heck of a seesaw,
hasn't it?
What?
I mean, look, that one night we had
if we just stay friends?
Seriously, what?
Okay. You know what?
If you want to,
we can do it one more time.
I mean, I'd be okay with that.
In fact, I have some time right now..
Okay.
You know what? Can I talk now?
-Oh, sure.
But you got..
-Can I get you some water?
-I'm good.
Ross, there is no pressure on you, okay? I
mean, you can be as involved as you want.
Yeah, I..
I'm just, I don't know.
-I know.
But you know, condoms only work,
like,  percent of the time.
What?
What?!
Well, they should put that on the box!
-They do.
-No, they don't!
Well, they should put it
-Well, I may as well have!
Listen, you know what?
I was really freaked out too..
-when I found out.
-Freaked..? Hey, I'm not freaked out.
I'm indignant as a consumer!
-You know what? Let's talk later.
of the condom company.
Okay, you know what?
Maybe I should come back.. Okay.
Yeah, I'll press one!
-I looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
-So then I can heat this up?
Anyway, I'll get moving
not tell Chandler and Monica about this?
Because, you know, they don't have
any kids of their own..
and this door was like a child to them.
Well, I'm gonna have to put on a
new lock. They'll find out anyway.
It's looking like an all-day job.
I can't make it to yoga class today?
Sure.
-Oh, my God! What happened to the door?
-So it's noticeable, huh?
-Look, is Rachel here? I need to talk to her.
-Didn't you two already talk?
Yeah, but..
Okay. Look, you guys know
-Oh, my God, I can't believe that!
-With my child.
-That is brand-new information!
-You already know, don't you?
-Little bit.
-How you doing?
I handled it very well.
-What'd you say to her?
-Nothing.
But the complaint department
at the condom company got an earful.
-Then when I turned around, she was gone.
that condoms are only, like, % effective.
-What?
-I gotta go find her.
Hey. Hold on! Are you serious?
So, like,  percent of the time,
they don't even work?
They should put that on the box!
-Evidently, they do.
-You've gotta be kidding.
What?
As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would
like to give you the honeymoon suite.
No! You have been screwing us all day!
-Who are you?
-We're you. Just  seconds later!
You already got the first-class tickets,
on your honeymoon!
You can have the suite if you want.
We don't care about where we stay.
We're here to celebrate our love
for each other.
We don't have to get free stuff.
coming from your apartment.
-What? Are you serious? Joey smells gas.
-What else is new?
-We'd check it out, but you took our keys.
-Well, do something. Get in there!
-How? I guess I could break down your door.
-No.
-Are you doing it? I don't hear anything.
-Okay, I'll break it down.
Hi. He's doing it,
he's breaking down the door.
Okay, we're in.
-Okay, Rachel, are you comfortable?
to do your sonogram.
Okay.
Oh, man, I swear, if they sold these
at Pottery Barn..
-Hi.
-Hi.
We need to talk.
Right now? Because I kind of got
for the way I acted earlier today.
-That's fine. Can you stay up near my head?
-What? Oh, yeah, sorry.
I went crazy. I was thinking about myself
when I should've been thinking about you..
-Okay, head, Ross! Head, Ross!
through this whole thing. Okay?
The doctor's appointments, the Lamaze
classes, baby-proofing the apartment.
Although, we can worry about that
after we get married.
-Married?
But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
No. But still, I mean,
you can't possibly do this alone.
Excuse me?
-You can't even eat alone in a restaurant.
-What?
If you can't eat by yourself, how do you
-When have you ever?
When certain people leave the table
and I am not finished!
Well, certain other people take two hours
to eat a bowl of soup!
Oh, please. You inhale your food.
I grew up with Monica.
This is Ross. He is the father.
But not the husband, because,
evidently, she can do this alone.
Nice to meet you. I'll get started on this.
-Why you can't admit you need me?
-I need you to stay near my head!
Okay. Everything looks good.
I'll give you two a minute.
-Okay.
-Thank you.
Pretty amazing, huh?
I don't see it!
-What?
-I can't see it.
But you just said that you did.
I know. I lied. I didn't want her
Come here. Look, it's right there.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I see it now.
-Do you really?
-No, I don't see it!
Okay. Come on. All right. Okay.
You see this tiny thing
that looks like a peanut?
Yeah.
Sweetie, that's it.
That's it?
Well, I saw that.
-Thank you.
-Yeah. Why?
I was trying to figure out how bad
I want one of Monica's turkey pot pies.
-Hi.
-Hey.
-So how was the doctor?
-Hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
I don't see the baby. Where is it?
Oh, no, I know. I couldn't see it either
at first. But it's right..
Ross, I lost it again.
Wait. Before we go in, I just
want you to know that I love you.
I had a great time on our honeymoon.
I can't wait
the shell necklace, huh?
You're back!
Come on in!
How was the honeymoon?
So much fun. The best part is,
we met this great couple.
That was the best part?
Good honeymooning, tiger.
They're cool.
Is it too soon to call?
We're excited. We finally
have a couple to hang out with.
Oh, were you looking for that?
Well, yeah.
A couple? Like two people?
Like one, two people?
It's different.
"Hi, Greg. I'm Chandler."
"Hi, Monica. This is Jenny."
"Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg."
-They're great. If you just..
-You know what?
Give us our souvenirs
-You're kidding!
-We didn't get anything for anyone.
-Nice necklace.
That you can have.
-Welcome home.
-How was the honeymoon?
Great! How about you?
would have a child out of wedlock.
-Look, I have a sonogram picture.
-Good.
Ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.
Now that Ross knows, how'd it happen?
When? How many times?
Monica, that's not right.
He'd been hanging out with Joey.
You're welcome, buddy.
Yeah, thanks.
I had a lot of work,
and Ross offered to help.
We had wine, we got to talking.
Next thing you know,
Ross comes on to me.
That's a little misleading.
-What is?
-There's the one!
-But you did. Let's be honest.
-Yes, let's.
Ross. If it helps, I don't believe you.
It's not important.
What's important is, we're having
a baby, not who came on to who.
"Whom."
That's right.
-You kissed me first.
that I'd send Ross begging signals?
Please, show of hands.
It doesn't matter what people believe!
It happened.
Maybe I need to be more careful.
Am I sending these signals now?
-You know what? Just drop it.
I have it on videotape.
It's an expression.
Come on, Rachel, open up.
Let me explain.
-Still won't let you in, huh?
-No.
I'm just gonna close this door
he taped them having sex.
Yeah. You gotta tell a girl
before you tape her.
Such a rookie mistake.
-Know who has a great camera?
-Greg and Jenny?
-I want to call them.
their friends souvenirs.
Hello. th Street Deli?
Hang up. You get food poisoning
just talking to that place.
-Sorry, wrong number.
-Here you go, babe.
Hello?
-You got fake-numbered.
-What? People don't do that.
-Oh, I think we do.
-Why would they do that?
-I don't know.
You were a delight.
Joke, joke, joke! You were a hoot!
You still got me and Phoebe.
Excuse me, I don't want
Greg and Jenny's rejects.
Rachel won't talk to me.
She won't open the door.
I wonder why, pervert.
Okay, I am not a pervert.
That's, like, the pervert motto.
You raise your hand, put your left
Joey can back me up.
A month and a half ago, remember
I came to you with a problem?
The personal thing?
-What personal thing?
-About sex?
That I hadn't had sex in months?
Yeah, I knew what
I'm uncomfortable talking about.
Sure.
How about you showering
with your mom?
I actually had a topic in mind.
I'm kind of going through
a dry spell, sex-wise.
-For, like, months?
appreciate the small things, like..
the sound of a bird
and the color of the sky.
The sky's blue, Ross.
And I had sex yesterday.
Please help me.
I'm scared for my health.
I got something.
It's this story that I came up with.
Very romantic.
Any woman that hears it is putty.
Tell it to me.
Now, you're gonna want to have sex
across Western Europe..
-You were backpacking across Europe?
-Have a nice six more months.
I'm sorry. Please, please.
You were in Western Europe, and..?
I was outside Barcelona, hiking
-Thanks.
I was at the end of this path,
and there was a lake.
Very secluded.
There were tall trees all around.
It was dead silent.
a beautiful woman bathing herself.
But she was crying.
Why?
This is great wine.
It's from France.
In Europe.
Western Europe.
A few years ago I was backpacking
across Western Europe.
-Really?
-Wait, it gets better.
Yeah, I was in Barcelona.
I studied for a year in Barcelona.
-You did?
-Nine?
Three.
I was ?
-So anyway, I was hiking..
-I love hiking!
That's great!
I was hiking along the foothills
of Mount Tibidaybo..
-I think it's "Tibidabo."
having sex right now.
-Your story sucks.
-Then you didn't tell it right.
-Show me how you did it.
-No, I don't want to.
-How long since you seen a girl naked?
-I was outside Barcelona, hiking..
-Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot?
-It's been six months. I'm always hot.
You're not selling the story.
You don't believe it.
I gotta go, I got a date.
and see what you're doing wrong.
I'll try that.
Now, you're all set up. Good to go.
Just hit record. Good luck.
If you ever have any problem with the
ladies, you know I'll help you out.
That means a lot to me, man.
Can I get you anything?
You have to help me.
Were you talking to yourself?
That's less embarrassing.
Yes. Yes, I was.
When she came in,
I totally forgot about the camera.
It kept rolling
to see that tape.
What a great idea!
That'll get Rachel to forgive me.
Come on, it'll be like watching
the Discovery Channel..
only we'll know the monkeys.
Look, I'm not gonna let you guys
-I'll trade you two tapes of me having sex.
Thanks, I'm good.
We don't wanna see the dirty stuff..
-just the stuff leading up to it.
-No. Rachel's gonna kill me as it is.
It's not fair to her.
Let's forget the tape.
Thank you.
-No.
-Loud and clear.
I don't get why
they'd give us a fake number.
If they knew what they were doing,
they didn't give you real names.
Maybe people give out fake numbers,
Nice to meet you.
Regina Phalange.
-We didn't do anything wrong.
-I know.
Although you did tell
an awful lot of jokes.
You said they were funny.
-What about them?
The sheer volume.
It was like flying with the Riddler.
-Was that another joke?
-Was that another question?
Is Ross still here?
Watch out, honey.
It was an honest mistake.
How would you like it if I had sex
with you and I taped it?
Oh, forget it.
There he is, the father of my child,
the porn king of the West Village.
It was an accident, okay?
I feel bad.
destroying it yourself.
Thank you.
What?
-You don't want to see this, do you?
-Hell, yeah!
I am not gonna show you this.
Not the sex part.
Just the stuff leading up to it.
Forget it.
We'll think of another way to put the
and she can do whatever she wants.
And she wants to destroy it,
so end of story.
-I want to see it.
-What?
You don't want us to see this.
You so badly don't want us to see it
-I don't believe you.
I think you don't want them
to see you begging me.
-Rachel, please?
-Oh, a little preview.
Fine. I want the record to show
I'm gonna be saying..
Okay, here we go.
I'm so happy.
Thank God you're here. Help me.
Were you talking to yourself?
-There I am.
-You're gonna get pregnant.
I screwed up so bad.
I told Monica that I'd send
and forgot about them until today.
Sweetie, it's okay. Everybody made it
to the wedding. I'm fine.
-Kind of hurting my hand though.
-I know.
I can't believe it, especially after
Be very careful, Rachel.
Please, drinking no liquids
around the invitations, Rachel."
Did you do it on our invitations?
Not on the ones we sent out.
So just the ones you gave back to us
and we had framed?
It seems like yesterday
How you and I almost..
Oh, I remember how we almost.
You think we would've
gone through with it?
You think we would have done it?
I know I wanted to.
I just wasn't sure if you did.
Oh, I wanted to.
So we both wanted to.
Interesting.
Anyway, it probably worked out
I backpacked through Western Europe?
Get ready to see some begging.
-Oh, you came on to Ross!
-What?
Now I'm so happy.
-What?
-You used the Europe story!
That's the magic story you use
-How do you know about that story?
My friend Irene heard it
from some guy.
Some guy!
No, she told me that
his name was Ken Adams.
Ken Adams!
So, people are familiar
thing really doesn't matter.
It would have happened either way.
If you hadn't initiated it,
I know I would have.
-It was an amazing night.
-It was. It was amazing.
You think it looked amazing?
I don't know.
-Yeah, it would be really weird.
-Good luck.
-Good luck to you.
-Mind if I mute?
-Oh, please.
-There go the clothes.
-I was gonna say.
-Nice tan.
-Thank you.
I'd just gone to
the beach that weekend.
-Have you been working out?
than I ever..
Oh, that's not pretty.
-Make it stop. Make it stop.
-Oh, no!
Greg and Jenny's number
is totally different in here.
-I don't ask too many questions, do I?
-Absolutely not.
-Really?
-Oh, God.
I bet that phone thing was some sort
of mix-up. I'm gonna call them.
Hello, Greg?
you gave me, --..
Jenny's been giving out
their old number!
Jenny! That is so Jenny!
How would you like to
get together next Saturday?
Okay, how about Sunday?
Okay, the week after that?
The week after that?
You know what? We are interesting,
can't see that..
January ?
We'll see you then!
This one's rare.
This one's medium-well. Go!
Hey, Phoebe! How was dinner?!
Dinner was good! Just saying hi!
Now I'm gonna go!
-Well, hello there.
Phoebe, this is Tim, my new sous chef.
-So you're Monica's boss?
-No, she's my boss.
-"Sous" is French for "under."
-I "sous-stand."
Tim, I need a calamari and a caesar salad.
-Yes, I did.
Would you say your pesto
is the best-o?
I don't know.
I would say it's pretty good-o.
I still need the calamari and salad.
I like your necklace.
"Coming up, Monica. I have to obey you,
we having this conversation? "
-I made it myself.
-You are so talented.
Well, it's no pesto.
Let's just cut to the chase.
You're single. You're single.
He gets off work at .
get one calamari and one caesar salad!
I did not yell.
I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
-Wow, Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
-You know me, sir.
Do you know how I can get around
the really good Internet porn?
You're a joker, Bing.
What's funny about that?
-Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
-That's okay. Where do you wanna go?
I think you know where I wanna go.
-The Hard Rock Cafe?
-Yeah.
-Again?
-You like the Purple Rain display.
-Hey, Bob.
-Hey, Toby. Have a good night.
-Did that guy just call you Toby?
-Yeah, he thinks that's my name.
-Why don't you correct him?
each other, so I didn't say anything.
The next time he said,
"Toby, want a doughnut?"
I wanted the doughnut.
Five years later, the doughnut's gone
and I'm still Toby.
-Chandler, you have to tell him.
He's on the sixth floor.
So he calls me Toby once in a while.
It's not like he's calling me Muriel.
Muriel.
Why would he call you Muriel?
Oh, my God.
Chandler "M." Bing.
It's not just an "M."
Your middle name is Muriel!
It is a family name.
Chandler Muriel Bing.
Your parents never even
for your memory loss.
What is it?
Your brain transplant
wasn't successful.
Your body's rejecting Jessica's brain.
Is it serious?
Not if we extract tissue
from the original body..
and synthesize antibodies
Let's just do that.
We would, but when we went
to exhume Jessica's body..
it was gone.
Very nice, people.
I'll change and we can go.
-What happened to Jessica's body?
-You'll have to see it on TV.
-You don't know, do you?
-You too.
What? You weren't in it.
Kash, this is my friend Rachel.
Rachel, Kash.
-Hi.
-Why haven't I seen you here before?
Joey just thinks I'll embarrass him.
I'm not.
Although, I do know your favorite
ice cream flavor is butter pecan.
And your dog's name is Wally.
-Look, I'm just stroking your arm.
-Here we go.
Bye, Kash.
-Hi.
I had the best time
with Tim last night. He is so sweet.
I can't wait
to get "sous-neath" him.
-I have to fire him.
He's slow. He burns things.
He lit my pastry chef on fire.
He was nervous.
You can be intimidating.
And your pastry chef can stand
to be taken down a peg.
Well, now she has no eyebrows.
another chance, please?
All right. But if he lights
someone else on fire, he's gone.
That's fair. Thank you so much.
Looks like he got you
a little bit too.
I paid to have this done.
Love it!
Hey. You know,
-I'm with you.
-He asked if you'd go out with him.
-I think I'm gonna throw up a little.
-What did you say?
-"No."
What?
I figured since you're pregnant,
Not people.
Did you tell him I was pregnant?
No. I didn't know if you told people.
This was when Kash was still "people."
-Good. Just have him call me.
-I don't think that's..
Go do it or I'll come back
-How's my pal Toby doing today?
If I see him, I'll ask.
Was that Bob from six
you were just talking to?
-Yeah.
-You know him?
We're on a semi-first-name basis.
-What about adding him to our team?
I don't know if he has what it takes.
-They love him down on six.
-But this is .
It's almost twice as hard up here.
-Okay, Bob will stay put.
-I think it's best, sir.
We do need to find somebody.
of documents this high.
Just toss them in the shredder
and claim you never got them.
That's a good one, Bing.
What does a guy have to do
to be taken seriously around here?
I gave him another chance,
who recommended him to me.
He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"
-But don't fire him today.
-Why?
-Because I'm dumping him today.
-You said he was sweet.
He's too sweet.
Was your shower okay?"
-Don't pick up the phone.
-Then he comes over!
"I was so worried about you."
Be a man!
So I can't fire him?
And dump him the same day?
with him another week.
Are you kidding? Another week
with that simp, I'll kill myself.
We'll both do it today
and he'll just have to deal with it.
Okay. But who's gonna go first?
-Fire a guy that's just been dumped?
Bitch!
And dump a guy that's just been fired?
Blond bitch!
I wanted to do this days ago,
so I think I should go first.
All right, that makes sense.
But screw you! I'm going first!
-Toby, you got a sec?
but it's not gonna happen.
Apparently somebody thinks
I'm not "th-floor material."
Say, who the hell is this Chandler?
What's the best excuse for why
I'm not drinking on this date tonight?
"I'm a recovering alcoholic,"
I'm still a little drunk"?
You're not gonna
tell him you're pregnant?
I don't think so. Books say wait
till the third date to tell the guy..
you got something
-Hi.
What do you want to do tonight?
There's a powerful Ukrainian film
playing. Interested?
No. But I'll go see
a normal-person movie with you.
-Rach, you wanna come?
-Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?
Why, no. It's the opposite of weird.
It's regular.
It's mundane.
It's actually a little dull.
It's no Ukrainian film.
Earrings!
-She's got a date? With who?
-No.
-What were you thinking?
-That it was okay..
because you two haven't dated
in five years.
I'm worried about my baby.
-Hey! I'm an "actor" too.
They're taking the ferry
to a place on Staten Island.
My baby's going on a ferry? Do you
have any idea how dangerous those are?
Aren't we talking about
or burn each other with matches?
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Kash. Ross, this is Kash.
Hey, I hear you're going
on a ferry tonight.
Bit of a daredevil, are we?
Do you guys think this is too slutty?
-Yeah. See you guys later.
Have a great time, you guys.
And yes, it is too slutty!
Hi.
Hi.
I'm glad you called.
I feel like I'm always calling you.
What's up?
-That's because I'm with you.
It's just, I'm in a place in my life
right now where..
So sorry. "This just in."
It's the restaurant.
Monica needs me right away.
No, she doesn't! I know what that is.
And not one I have to read.
I get that from books.
-Books?
-Okay, car magazines, cereal boxes..
but it's enough!
Let's not see a movie.
We'll just stay here and hang.
-Just wait for Rachel to come back?
-Why?
-He could be my baby's stepfather.
-One date and they're getting married?
He's not you!
I can't believe she's dating!
-What did you think she was gonna do?
-I don't know.
-I can't believe this is happening.
it'd be different.
I love Ben. But every time
I drop him off at Carol and Susan's..
it breaks my heart a little.
I've always had this picture
of me and my next wife in bed..
my kid comes running in, leaps up
-No. Rachel's out with some guy.
My baby went with her.
If anything, that picture
keeps moving further away.
Hey, can I ask you something?
In this picture of you and your wife,
is your wife Rachel?
It used to be.
Now she doesn't really have a face.
Smokin' body, though.
Good call. But the face, Ross,
if it were?
That's not what she wants.
I know. And I can't force myself
to fall in love with her.
Ross, maybe you need a new picture.
It won't be what you thought.
But no matter what..
there's gonna be
and have some fun.
Whatever you want. Come on.
-We can catch that Ukrainian film.
-No, I said fun.
-Hey, Toby?
-Hey, Bobby.
It's Bob, actually.
You work up here. Where's
Let me ask you, why?
I wanna talk to that bastard,
see what his problem is.
Okay, Bob. Listen.
I'm the reason you didn't get the job.
-Toby, don't.
-Bob.
Toby, I'm not gonna let you cover
more upset with Chandler.
That puts me
in a difficult position.
You do anything to Chandler,
it's gonna bring you down to his level.
I guess you're right.
Don't give him the satisfaction.
-That depends.
-How are you and Phoebe?
-Great. Thanks for introducing us.
My pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid
I've got some bad news.
-Phoebe!
-I'm breaking up with you!
I'm breaking up with you.
-You're fired.
-Why?
I'm sorry. I'm not ready
for a relationship right now.
I'm sorry too.
-The chemistry thing for us too.
Wow. Okay.
I realize I came on a little strong.
It's because I think you're amazing.
I wanna tell you how much I appreciate
you giving me an opportunity.
You're the most talented chef
-Yeah?
I spoke too quickly. There's
a learning curve with this job.
Maybe we could try it again.
Thank you so much.
I know I can be better.
And, Tim, I just want to say
-Hi.
How was the date?
I'm alone and I just bought $ worth
of candy bars. What do you think?
-What happened?
-I told him I was pregnant.
-He didn't take it so well?
-Oh?
Yeah. He got all weird and sputtery.
"I hear those hemorrhoids
are a bitch."
-He sounds swell.
Sit down.
Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
Chandler M. Bing.
Oh, my God.
-I'm sorry about your date.
-It's all right.
I guess I'm just done
that's completely different.
-This is hard.
-Yeah, I know.
On the other hand, in seven months
you're gonna have something..
that you're gonna love more than
your baby grabs your finger.
You have no idea.
Thanks, sweetie.
-You wanna grab some coffee?
-No. I'm gonna go eat  candy bars.
-I thought I cheered you up.
-You did. There are  in here.
-Good night.
From the wedding.
-Oh, hi!
-Hi.
-How are you?
-I'm good, except you owe me a dance.
That's right. Well, would you be
-Sure, let me get it for you.
Bob?
Bob!
Bob!
-What the hell are you doing?
-This is Chandler's office.
Come on, Toby. Give me a hand!
-Guys, guess what?
-What?
We're having a Halloween party!
-Good!
-I can't make it.
Come on, it'll be fun.
I'll be there. I have to wear a
costume to my classes that day anyway.
Tell me you're not gonna dress
like a dinosaur.
Not two years in a row.
-I'll come, but I'm not dressing up.
pretending to be someone you're not.
You're an actor.
Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
-I will.
-The girl from the wedding?
If she needs costume ideas,
she could be a bikini model..
or a slutty nurse,
Massacre. No! Slutty Leatherface.
Wasn't Joey hitting on her too?
That's right, he was hitting on her.
And I got her. I guess
the better man won.
Please don't take her from me.
Ursula!
Wait. It's me, Phoebe.
I thought there was a mirror there.
Okay. Bye.
Wait a second!
So, what's new with you?
Nothing.
Just family.
His.
Okay.
I'm happy for you.
Wait. If you want to come,
I guess that'd be okay.
-Really?
-Sure.
You could be my sister for the day.
Yeah, okay.
My friends are having a party tonight,
so who cares!
-It's a costume party.
-So that's why you're..
No.
But thanks.
-You're supposed to wear a costume.
-I am.
I am a woman who spent money
fit into it.
I'm Catwoman, who wants the dress
when you're too big for it.
-Trick or treat!
-Can I give out candy?
I want to be with kids. Since I got
-Just a minute!
Look at you guys!
-Wow! You are a very scary witch.
-Thank you.
-And you are a very funny clown.
-Thank you.
And you..
are so in style right now.
I work at Ralph Lauren. The fall line
-Could I just have the candy?
Sure.
Catwoman. So we meet again.
So we do, Supergirl.
It's me, Phoebe.
Monica, can I talk to you
for a second?
I appreciate the costume.
You did this to him?
I thought he'd love it.
-He loves The Velveteen Rabbit.
-That rabbit was brown and white.
It was pink, or no bunny at all.
No bunny at all.
-Yes, I did. I'm Chandler.
Dude, what happened?
How is that me?
I'm Chandler.
That is so you!
-When have I ever done that?
-When have I ever done that?
Trick or treat.
-You're the prettiest ballerina ever.
-Thank you.
That deserves another candy.
Thank you.
I have to say,
-I know.
But one said she loved me,
so I gave her everything.
No wonder you're pregnant.
-What are you supposed to be?
-Remember the satellite, Sputnik?
Well, I'm a potato. Or a "spud"..
and these are my antenna.
So Sputnik becomes..?
Spud-nik!
Wow! I don't have
-No, space-doodie.
Okay, I'm Spud-nik.
-You know, like Sputnik.
-What's a Sputnik, doodie-man?
Hey, sweetie.
-Aren't you gonna kiss me?
-Okay.
But right after, you have to tell me
-Ursula's fiance?
You're the sister. I just slapped
my future sister-in-law's ass.
Is your mother here?
I could slap her on the butt.
-My mother killed herself.
at me, I'm even sweatier. I should go.
No. We'll start over.
-Hi, I'm Phoebe.
-Eric.
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-Sweat's burning my eyes.
-Thank you.
-There's no name for it.
I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.
-No, I meant your costume.
-I'm a solar system.
My second graders helped.
-I love the second grade.
-Really?
It's much better than first grade,
and the mind games.
-So, what do you do?
-I'm a masseuse, by day.
-You don't have to stand with me.
-I'm having fun.
-I'm excited for you and Ursula.
-Thank you.
-Hey, Joey?
-Yeah?
-You read comic books, right?
-Exclusively.
Who would win in a fight,
-Yeah.
Between you and Phoebe?
I'd give Phoebe the edge.
-What? Really?
-You kidding?
Phoebe lived on the street, okay?
-I'm not sure.
What? Come on, I am tough!
Punch me here, as hard as you can!
Relax. Why are you so serious?
It doesn't matter.
Really? What if I told you
Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
I would say, "Woman, please."
Ursula's fiance is really sweet.
-You think you could take him?
He's so great.
He's a teacher,
he does volunteer work.
Normally, I don't like sweaty guys.
But I could just mop him up.
-Oh, my God, Phoebe?
-No, I'm not, you are!
Here comes the temper.
Trick or treat.
Know what? We're out of candy.
But someone went for more.
And I've been giving out money,
but I'm out of that too.
-Can I write you a check?
-Lelani Mayolanofavich.
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out
to "cash."
-Hi.
-Hi, Mona.
Joey's gonna be thrilled. He was
but I'm maxed out.
-You made it.
-Wait.
-You're a potato?
-Well, I'm a spud..?
-And the antenna.. You're Spud-nik!
a fight between Ross and Chandler?
I can't answer that.
Chandler's my husband.
-So Ross?
-Yeah.
-Hey, beautiful.
When did you guys meet?
-Two weeks ago.
-That's it?
I know. It sounds crazy,
and I'm not impulsive, but..
-we have so much in common.
-Peace Corps, really?
When we were building in Uruguay,
we were two towns apart and never met.
Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got
there, but it was a town when I left.
-Shall we get me really drunk?
bunny costume his wife made him wear.
Relax, man. You're looking
a little flushed.
-Our question might get answered.
-What question?
Who could kick whose ass in a fight,
-So you think Ross too?
-You picked Ross?
-Ross is strong.
He's the strongest out of all three
of you. Except for Joey.
-I can't believe you didn't pick me.
Why don't you prove it?
I'll prove it like a theorem!
All right! Stop it!
Stop! No one's gonna fight.
People came to see a fight,
let's give them one!
-You guys could arm-wrestle.
-Listen to the slutty nurse.
-You're going down.
is embarrassing.
Gunther, you brought candy.
Thank you so much.
-You are so sweet.
-Really?
You are gonna make some man
-Trick or treat.
Hi! Wow! There you go.
My friend Lewis told me
you were giving out money.
We were, but now we've got candy.
I'd rather have the money.
That's not your choice.
Happy Halloween!
This isn't fair.
Is it fair that you put on a cape
-I think I just did.
And here it comes again. Shut up!
No, I got it. I'm good. I got it.
Wait, I had one more thing to say.
Right. Shut up.
You're a mean old woman.
Wait! Shut.. Don't cry!
Let me get my checkbook!
You don't have to do this. The
strength inside you means the most.
You're loyal, you're honest
-Hey.
He's marrying you because he thinks
the things you were saying were true.
-They could be true.
-But they're not.
It's a fine line.
-Why are you lying?
He got so excited, it was fun.
You can't do this.
You're gonna ruin his life.
Why are you taking this so seriously?
It's just a marriage.
Besides, if I cheat on him,
and I want you to quit now!
She's helped so many people quit.
We'd better get going.
-You have a church group meeting.
-Right.
-It was nice meeting you.
-You too.
And, Ursula, it was really nice
We're waiting!
Okay, guys. One match,
winner take all.
Wait. What does the winner get?
-Pride.
-And dignity.
Okay, if you say so.
All right, ready, set, go!
-Come on!
-Or equally weak.
Oh, God. Chandler's making
his sex face.
-So you getting tired?
-No. I could do this all day.
Yeah. Me too.
-Getting a little tired, though.
okay? Mona's standing right there.
She's talking to Joey!
You gotta let me win!
Let me win.
My wife thinks I'm a wimp.
At least you have a wife.
-Come on, who we kidding? I'm doodie.
Please? She's watching.
-Fine.
-Thanks.
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah!
My hero!
You're a weird lady.
Ursula said she left her purse.
What a relief. It has the numbers
to the wedding.
I wish you all the luck in the world.
And I also want to give you
a little piece of advice..
that I give to everyone
who's getting married.
Don't trust your wife.
I think we'll be okay.
It's so perfect,
-What?
She is lying. And I bet
I could prove it. Excuse me.
Okay. Yeah, not a prayer chain.
But what looks like a detailed drawing
of a bank floor plan.
Here's the name tag from
-She told me she was .
I almost don't want to show you.
Just remember, I'm a minute younger.
I am so stupid.
Of course she's not a teacher.
There's no such thing as a "Top Secret
School for the Children of Spies."
No, you're not stupid.
I'm not smart.
I just wanted so much
to be impulsive for once.
-To be romantic.
You did it with the wrong person.
-What?
-It's weird, two people look so alike.
And so different.
Eric! Let's go!
-Better go deal with it.
-Yeah, you should.
Hurry up! I gotta pray!
I had to give the kid
as his girlfriend.
I am awful with children.
You're good with kids.
They're just crazy on Halloween.
They're all greedy,
hopped up on sugar.
-That's all it is?
for Christmas. And their birthdays.
They get crazy during the summer too.
And any time they're
hungry or sleepy.
Kids are tough.
Good luck with that.
Look, I'm sorry you lost.
I got a secret for you.
-Yeah?
Would you tell her
I let you win, please?
Chandler "let me win."
No, Chandler's really strong.
My arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?
I am strong. I'll show you.
Chandler, please.
What's the matter? Scared?
Let's go, big bunny!
One, two, three. Go!
I'm gonna kill myself!
Oh, my God, you cleaned!
you for months! And you did, you cleaned.
-And nagging works!
-No, I didn't actually do this.
Oh, no. Was I cleaning
in my sleep again?
No, it wasn't you.
-Well, then, who?
because if some other woman was cleaning..
Now, honey, I know you don't like
to relinquish control.
"Relinquish" is just a fancy word
for "lose."
She's nice, and she mentioned that she
I thought it was a joke.
-Now, just give her a chance, okay?
-Fine, I can do it.
-What's the matter?
-Usually when I'm this anxious, I clean.
Whose cell phone is that?
party. Ursula's fiance.
Oh, my God, Eric, hi!
Wait, how'd you get this number?
I have a friend who's a cop,
and he got it for me.
Wow. What an incredible violation
I broke up with Ursula.
Oh, you did?
He did it, he did it!
-What did he do?
-I'm talking!
Anyway, I was wondering if you were
just broke up with my sister.
Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. Bye.
No, no. Wait! I was just saying that
so you'd think I was a good person.
Fight for me.
I won't take "no" for an answer.
Not great, but we can
work on it at lunch.
I can be at your apartment
than I thought it was gonna be.
Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.
So apparently I'm available
for lunch.
I can't. I'm busy.
I'm apartment hunting.
You're moving?
I can't live with Joey
to be, "How you doing?"
So does Joey know you're moving?
I haven't discussed it with him,
but I know he'll be relieved.
Last week, he brought this girl over,
and I talked to her about morning sickness.
Then I showed her pictures
-Not so much.
I heard in the elevator this morning
that a woman in my building died.
Oh, my God. Was she old?
Does she have a view?
I don't know, but how great would that be?
I could come over whenever I want..
with your permission.
That really would be great.
Well, can we see it?
Maybe we shouldn't.
I mean, if she just died this morning.
Yeah. No. No, you're right.
-Shall we?
I live in the building.
And I'm Rachel,
an admirer of the building.
I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing
away, and I am so sorry for your loss.
-She didn't pass away.
-Oh, thank God!
It looked like we were gonna lose her
this morning, but she's a tough old bird.
Are you close with her?
Of course. She and I would
talk all the time..
in the laundry room.
You speak Dutch?
You know, I would,
in a one-bedroom or a two?
Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible.
Where did you get it?
Oh, well..
I make it myself.
It's two parts ammonia and one part
from the laundry room now.
When I come back,
I'll clean behind the refrigerator.
I love her.
I'll be back in a minute.
Okay.
-See? I told you.
-She stole my jeans!
What?
I've been looking for them all week,
came back and wore them in front of you?
Don't you see?
It's the perfect crime!
She must have been
planning this for years!
I'll prove it to you, okay.
I dropped a pen in my lap, and it left
and show you that stain!
Isn't it possible the company that sold
the jeans made more than just the one pair?
I guess.
Shouldn't we give her the benefit of the
doubt before we snoop around her crotch?
Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give
what is your secret ingredient?
Yeah.
-Hi.
-Come in. I'm so glad you're here.
Yeah. Me too.
Not in the shaky, angry way
that you are, though.
Sorry. I just saw Ursula.
just looking at her..
-Face.
-Yeah. Yeah.
I'm sorry. It's just,
when I look at you..
I see her.
And when I see her,
watching you flip out.
Sorry.
-Maybe this is too weird.
-Wait.
There's only a problem
when I look at you.
I got it. I got it.
No, don't tear out your eyes!
-I was just gonna take out my lenses.
look like Ursula. You're "Blursula."
Okay, wait. Maybe..
If I just don't look at you
for a while.
See? It works. I'm not angry at
all anymore. This is a great date!
Yeah, not so much.
It's kind of hard
Sure, we can have a conversation.
Tell me a little
something about yourself.
Oh, me?
Look, Eric, turn around.
I like you, but it shouldn't be
this hard. This is our first date.
First dates are supposed to be
did he mean to?" and first kisses..
Second kisses.
Thanks for the coffee, or
Yeah, we're done.
Hey, Ross. You wanna go see
that new IMAX movie on tide pools?
-Really?
-No.
But I got Knicks tickets
we can go to a strip joint.
-Really?
-No.
All right, let's go.
I have to stop by my place.
To tape the game? You do this every
time. You're not gonna be on TV!
No, I have to see if this apartment
-It's not for me, it's for Rachel.
-She has an apartment.
-When the baby comes, she's gonna move.
-She is?
-Yeah.
You didn't expect her
-Oh, thanks.
-I like your top.
-Oh. You're not getting it.
-What happened?
-Oh. I fell asleep!
I was thinking about taking
That'll work up your appetite for lunch.
All right.
Hello.
What's going on?
I'm sorry. I've never had a maid
before. Is this not okay?
I don't understand.
Why was your head
just between my legs?
That's a fair question.
Well, my head was
very attractive.
Are you coming onto me?
Apparently.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-How was the game?
-It was okay. I ate way too much.
I was talking to Ross, and he said
If certain Dutch people would just let go.
I was kind of hoping you'd stay.
Joey, I have to go.
There's no room for a baby here.
No room? It's a baby.
It's, like, this big.
You could put it over here.
Or we could put it right here.
You wouldn't even notice it.
"Where's the baby?"
"Oh, it's right over.."
Honey, it's not just a matter
of where you put it.
A baby changes everything.
trying to score with a screaming baby.
I could use a challenge.
It's getting pretty easy.
It's so sweet that you want me
to stay, but I can't.
It would disrupt your entire life.
It's just..
-I know.
You know, I blame Ross for this.
I do too, a little bit.
I'm gonna miss you.
You're the hottest roommate
I ever had.
Oh, no, I have to go.
I have a massage appointment.
No, stay here. We'll keep doing this.
for that before.
-I'll see you later?
-Absolutely.
I love the way you kiss.
Really? That's the thing I'm worst at!
You'll see.
Hey.
-Hey. I think Brenda needs a raise.
between her legs.
-To see her pants?
-They're my pants!
Are you sure?
Did you see the stain?
No. I was getting into position,
Will you let this go?
Fine.
-She's wearing my bra!
-Oh, dear God!
My pink, flowered bra!
I recognize the strap!
Yet you don't recognize
and you're gonna look at Brenda's bra.
Here's another plan. No.
I would do it, but she thinks
I'm attracted to her.
-Why?
-Did you not hear where my head was?
We're a team.
the same way.
Do this for me. I catch you looking
at women's breasts all the time.
You see that?
Do you see this?
All right, yes.
Okay. I get your point.
But if it's not her bra, will you
the right cup, there's a very noticeable rip.
You need new clothes.
-Hi. How is she?
-It's not looking good.
Well, I brought her some bloemen.
That's so sweet. Would you like to say
goodbye? It would mean a lot to her.
Oh, I don't know that it would.
-Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
-Welcome back.
-Shall we pick up from where we left off?
-I'm still tired from this afternoon.
-Why?
-The sex.
-What sex?
with somebody that looked like..
-You had sex with Ursula?
-A little bit.
She walked in, I thought she was you
and I kissed her and..
-You didn't notice different clothes?
-No, it's not. I don't wanna lose you.
It's like I was saying to Ursula
when I was making love..
Yeah. It's too weird.
So I guess this is it.
Yeah.
Maybe it's for the best.
-You smell just like her.
-Yeah, so do you.
-What are you doing?
-What?
It's flown into your blouse, and you better
undo your buttons lest it sting you.
-I think I know what's going on here.
-You do?
Look, I know it must be hard
-Okay, good.
Could I just see your bra?
Hi.
-Where'd you get those jeans?
-You gave them to me.
-No, I didn't!
-All right, I took them.
I figured it'd be okay because
-What bra?
-The pink one with the flowers.
-You mean the one you're wearing?
I quit!
Sounds about right.
What is this?
This is just to give you an idea.
We can put screens here
so that the baby has privacy..
and maybe a mobile over the crib..
and here's a baby monitor which, till the
And you gave the baby Hugsy!
That's really just to show
where the baby would go.
Why don't I hold on to him
so there's no confusion.
Joey, the baby is gonna be crying.
-It's gonna be up all night.
-I'm up all night.
-It's gonna poop.
Hello!
What about all the women?
If I'm bringing home a woman
who can't stand a baby..
then maybe I don't wanna
in the bathroom of the club!
But I won't say stuff
like that around the baby.
Joey, are you sure?
Yeah. Look, I know sometimes
it'll be hard, okay..
but it'll also be really,
I really want you to stay.
I want me to stay too. Thank you.
-Joey, look at this crib. It's so cute.
-I know. I found it on the street.
Are you..? Really?
This is in such good condition.
Whoa! What's under the cover?
-I don't know.
And how do I know?
Because her dying wish
was for one last kiss.
And because I'm such a strong,
strapping alleenstaande..
I had to carry her body to the lobby.
You know, and she was
you got the apartment. Yes!
Yeah. I think I'm gonna stay here.
Isn't that great?
What..? You..
But.. Bu..
Hey, I'm having dinner with my dad
tomorrow night. Do you wanna come?
Sure, yeah. He's kind of sexy.
Oh, no, I'll be there too.
So we'll come up with some kind of signal.
I haven't told him that I'm pregnant yet.
Oh. Why not?
Because I know he's gonna flip out,
and I hate it when he's angry.
Rachel, this is all
so "Papa Don't Preach."
No, Phoeb, wait. He's a scary guy.
again, he'd make me eat the entire pack.
Wow. Well, I will be there.
Gosh, I'm not gonna let that man
make you eat your baby!
Hey, who is that guy?
I think I know him.
No, you don't.
Oh, my God! Monica, he's the stripper
-She untied his G-string with her teeth.
Somebody stop me!
We weren't having bachelor, bachelorette
parties. We agreed that it's a silly tradition.
It's a grand tradition!
I'm sorry. They surprised me.
There was nothing I could do.
Well, you could've untied it
to throw my best friend a bachelor party..
but I wasn't allowed.
All we got was a stupid steak dinner.
You went home with the waitress.
Yeah, that was a pretty good night.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
You know that the two pillars of
marriage are openness and honesty.
I knew giving you that book was gonna
-Oh, I don't eat meat.
It's chicken!
-I don't eat that either.
-I never understand you lesbians.
-So, baby, tell me, what's new with you?
-Well, actually..
Your ' Lafite, sir.
I ordered the '. That's a
idiot? Is that why you're a waiter?
This is why I told the manager
I wouldn't wait on you.
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a baby.
In case you didn't notice,
The ' is absolute piss.
This was such a huge mistake.
I can't tell him, Phoebe. I can't.
Rachel..
I'm gonna wait a couple of years,
and then the baby will tell him.
-Why? So he can get mad at the baby?
-I have no idea. I went to the bathroom.
So, sweetie, you were starting
to tell me what is new with you.
I got TiVo.
-What's TiVo?
-It's slang for "pregnant."
Well, what were you thinking
Oh, no. Please don't tell me it's her.
No, it's Ross. It's
Ross. You like Ross.
Daddy, I hope you're okay
with all of this.
Think about it. This is a good thing.
-The who?
The wedding.
There's going to be a wedding.
Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me
my first grandchild is gonna be a bastard!
-Tell me there's gonna be a wedding!
you were falling asleep.
No, I had my eyes closed so I could
concentrate and, you know, take it all in.
Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
-I've got to get going.
-Okay, I'll see you tonight?
Thanks for showing me your
How's it going?
It's good. It's going good.
I mean, we get along great.
She's so..
-Hot?
-I was gonna say sweet, but yeah!
She's okay with the baby?
I haven't actually told her yet.
think you're going down the same path..
but you're really going
down different ones.
I'm gonna take that book and I'm
gonna beat you to death with it.
Oh, my God, you are gonna
marriage, I just like you a lot.
All right. I felt bad about
the bachelorette party thing..
so tonight you're gonna have
a bachelor party.
I got this number from this guy at work and
-Will you let the lady talk?
Come on, it'll be fun.
It'll make me feel so much better.
I got you party hats and porn.
Throw in my father making out
with the magician..
and it's just like my th birthday
I'm not a bachelor anymore.
Don't think of it as a bachelor party. Think
of it as a two-month anniversary present.
Sure. One year is paper,
but two months is lap dance.
Please, I feel so bad.
-Yeah!
And Joey.
-Thank you. Who else do you wanna invite?
-Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
Actually, sorry, I can't even make it.
I'm seeing Mona tonight.
Who would cancel an actual date
I gotta cancel tonight, baby.
I'm sorry I won't make it to your
imaginary wedding, but I'm busy that day.
I already have a unicorn baptism
and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
I know, I know. I panicked.
I didn't want him to start yelling at me
drinking quite nicely.
All right, here he comes. I'm gonna tell him.
I'm gonna be strong.
I just called a friend of mine.
I think I may be able
to book The Plaza on short notice.
Really?
The Plaza?
Oh, Daddy!
-Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you.
Ross and I aren't getting married.
-I'm sorry, Daddy.
-I don't believe this!
-Daddy, stay calm, please.
-How do you expect me to stay calm?
This is unacceptable, Rachel.
won't marry you?
-Is that it?
-Yes. He says I'm damaged goods.
You nervous about getting married?
What are you doing?
Let's pretend it's a real bachelor party,
before your wedding. It'll be more fun.
All right. I can't believe
gonna be with another woman?
Knowing you're gonna have to wake up
to the same face every day..
until you finally have
the sweet release of death.
You're right. This is more fun.
That's her! Okay, come on!
Which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
That's me!
That's me.
Joey Tribbiani. Big fan.
-Is that a bedroom?
-I'm waiting.
-So she's a..
-Yeah, that's one naked hooker.
I love your place.
Where is this guy from?
That's an th-century Indian artifact
and then not marry her?
I'm gonna kill you!
You know, this is actually not
a great time for me.
So come on.
Explain yourself, Geller.
-First, you get my Rachel pregnant.
-You did!
Yes, I did, but it was a one-night thing.
It meant nothing.
Oh? Really? That's what my daughter
means to you, nothing?
No, sir. She means a lot to me.
-But not that way.
I'm not in love with her.
I love her like a friend.
That's how you treat a friend,
get her in trouble and refuse to marry her?
Hey, I offered to marry her.
spend your time with this tramp?
Tramp?
I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona.
Mona, Dr. Green.
I can't believe there is
a naked hooker in there!
Maybe she's a hooker
about what to do.
Could be. I mean, technically, she did strip.
We just missed it.
Ma'am?
Are you also a stripper?
No, but I can pretend to strip.
But that's gonna cost extra.
Okay, here's the extras:
That's pretty funny.
That is funny. Maybe for my birthday
she'll murder someone.
I'll bet Ross was in on it too.
I mean, he was "conveniently" busy.
-Do you mind if I smoke in here?
burn that room down anyway.
-How could you have kept all this from me?
-I was going to tell you, but..
You figure you'd get what you wanted,
then you'd dump her like you did Rachel.
Hey, I did not dump Rachel.
There's a hooker over here..
and we thought maybe you'd
know something about it.
No! No! No!
No!
I need to lie down.
Hey, guys, can I talk to you
for a minute?
Listen, again, I want to urge you
you're going to, and it's not very good.
Tonight's the night
of the big bachelor party?
-Thanks for giving me that girl's number.
-No problem. Say, who's the party for?
-For my husband.
-No, she's a hooker.
-Is that what they call strippers sometimes?
-When they're hookers.
Oh, my God.
Stu, I can't believe you did this.
Now, you're sure she's a hooker?
It's either that, or she's just the best,
to learn something.
Is there anything you're really bad at,
you know, sexually?
This is the worst
bachelor party ever.
-What's taking you boys so long?
What's gonna happen in a minute?
All right. Maybe you should ask her
to leave.
-Why me?
-Hey, it's your bachelor party.
-Which is why you should do it.
for who has to tell the whore to leave.
-What?
-I miss this.
I don't think we've
actually done this before.
No, I miss hanging out with you.
-We still hang out.
we used to be inseparable.
You know, now it's like
things are different.
Well, you know, things are different.
I'm married now.
And, hey, don't get me wrong,
Just us, you know?
Yeah, I miss that too.
I'll tell you what. From now on,
we'll make time to hang out.
You got it. Come here.
Oh, God.
Listen, I am this close
to robbing you guys.
She's a hooker! She's a hooker!
-I better go.
Just over here.
I don't wanna miss the fight.
Ross, I am so sorry.
I promise, I will straighten this out
with him tomorrow, in person.
Or via e-mail.
I don't care about your dad. I care about
What's her e-mail address?
All right, I promise, I'll fix this.
I swear. I'll talk to her.
Okay. Thank you.
That's it?
You call that a fight?
"We were on a break!" "No, we weren't!"
for coming back over.
Oh, good. You're here.
And I was worried that
it was going to be uncomfortable.
No, Mona, just hear me out.
First of all, I am so sorry
about my father yelling at you.
But I heard that you held your own.
-Okay.
Yes, Ross and I used to date.
And yes, we are gonna have a baby.
But we are definitely not
getting back together.
-How can I be sure of that?
-Because we drove each other crazy.
He was possessive, he was jealous.
to how kind and gentle..
and thoughtful he is.
You probably shouldn't touch me.
I don't wanna get in the middle
of something so complicated.
I get it, but, Mona, what relationship
is not complicated?
We all have our baggage.
just tell me about all this?
Because what's going on has nothing to do
with how I feel about you.
-You still should have told me.
-I know, and I was going to..
but I thought it was better
I really, really like you. Really.
Okay. I guess you can
close the door now.
Forgot my purse.
Oh, you guys made up.
He's a good kisser, isn't he?
she was a hooker.
Did you let her smoke in here?
Her ass-print is still on your grandmother's
quilt. Really want to talk about smoking?
You know what,
I'm gonna make this up to you.
I promised you a stripper..
and you're gonna get a stripper.
-Monica, wait.
-Could you not narrate?
Gotcha, sailor.
Just because
you're not in love with the guy..
-You told your dad the truth.
-About an hour ago.
-Wanna go see a movie?
have to do with it?
There are more important things
than love.
You have to think about the baby.
You have to think about
the consequences of your decisions!
Hey, I do think about
their size and never go back?
Oh, my God! Let me see that.
You fall for it every time.
Hey! I brought you
my old maternity clothes.
Oh, Pheebs, that's so sweet.
Oh, those are so cute!
Look. See how they expand
they're great for shoplifting melons.
Good, you're all here.
Guess who I invited? Remember
Will Culvert from high school?
-No.
Really overweight.
I was his thin friend.
I don't remember. Are you talking
about your imaginary boyfriend?
No, that was Jared.
Wow. Haven't thought about him
in a long time.
Will's here on business, and he didn't have
-Oh, he's lost a bunch of weight.
He looks good.
Okay, I mean really gorgeous.
-I still love Chandler.
-Wouldn't hurt you to say it once in a while.
Just so you know,
-Phoebe doesn't eat turkey.
-Phoebe! -Turkeys are
beautiful, intelligent animals.
No, they're not! They're ugly
and stupid and delicious!
Plus, eating them is like a tradition.
It goes back to the first Thanksgiving when
that big rodeo at Plymouth Rock.
It's not just Phoebe. Will's still on a diet,
Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food..
-Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.
-She is?
Yeah. Remember? I had to leave
because I put the whole thing..
on my hand
and made it walk across the table.
It's not worth it to make a whole turkey
for just three people. It's a lot of work.
But you gotta have turkey
Fourth of July with no apple pie.
Or Friday with no two pizzas.
Fine, if it means that much to you.
But there's gonna be a ton left over.
No. I promise I will finish that turkey.
You're telling me you can eat
almost an entire turkey in one sitting?
That's right. Because I'm a Tribbiani!
thinkers or world leaders..
we don't read a lot or run fast,
but damn it, we can eat!
Four wide receivers. On third and .
Isn't it weird how next year
there will be a baby at the table?
Rachel's. But good to know
-Hey!
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-You too!
-Can I help?
-Yes.
Chandler usually helps,
go across the hall to check on the yams.
No, sweetie. No, not like that.
We're not at a barn dance.
Fold them like swans.
I showed you at Christmas. Remember?
Yeah, it all just came
screaming back to me.
-So how's the game?
-I'm pretending to watch..
so I don't have to help out.
I don't believe you!
That is brilliant!
-And Monica has no idea?
-No.
Once in a while,
-Anderson just scored again.
There is no Anderson.
I wanna get in on this. Hey, Mon?
I can't help you after all.
I didn't realize this game was on.
-You like football?
-Normally, I don't.
But, you know, Green Bay is playing.
-You like Green Bay?
-Will, I'm so glad that you came.
You look great. You must've lost..
 pounds. I'll be on one of those
Subway commercials.
-A pie!
-It's no fat, no sugar, no dairy.
-It's no good. Throw it out.
This is Will.
Oh, hey. I'd shake your hand
but I'm really into the game.
Plus, it'd be better for my ego
if we didn't stand next to each other.
-This is Phoebe.
-I can't get over how great you look.
-You look incredible too. You're so fit.
-I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf.
-I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
-Great, I love Ross.
Good. And Rachel Greene too.
-Is there a problem?
-I hated her.
She was horrible to me in high school.
But hey, that was a long time ago. I'm in
a good place. Might be fun to see her again.
Got any cakes or cookies
or something?
No, Will! No!
It's been a while since we screamed.
-Come on!
Damn you, ref! You burn in hell!
What are you doing?
You've got an entire turkey to eat.
Let me explain to you how
the human body works.
I have to warm up my stomach first.
-Eating chips is like stretching.
-I'm here to tell you something.
You can eat and eat, but nothing
will ever fill that void.
-Who the hell is this guy?
-This is Will, from high school. This is Joey.
-Want some chips?
-Ross!
Hey, you came!
Man, you look incredible! Hot stuff!
-Hot stuff?
-It's good to see you, man.
Yeah. You too. So, what are you up to?
-I'm a commodities broker.
-Oh.
-But I'm rich and thin.
-Oh.
I haven't seen you since
Lance Davis' graduation party.
That was such a fun night.
Would've been good if we had
how into dinosaurs we were?
-Yeah.
-So, what do you do now?
So how long are you in town?
-Hi.
-Hey, sweetie. Oh, good.
Rachel Greene.
Oh, that's right.
God, I hate her, Ross! I hate her!
High school was a long time ago.
Look at her standing there
with those yams.
and complex carbohydrates.
Oh, my God. Who is that?
-That's Will, from high school.
smoldering thing going on.
Oh, my God. Look at the way
he's just staring at me.
He's trying to mouth something to me.
I hate you!
-Okay, dinner's ready!
-Okay!
-Solid effort. Solid effort.
-Detroit.
-What?
-The Lions technically won.
But it was a moral victory
for the Green Bay Mermen.
Hi! Will, right?
-Really? Aren't you sweet?
I gotta tell you, I'm having
the hardest time placing you.
Hang on! I think I remember you.
Did we fool around at
Lance Davis' graduation party?
-You are unbelievable.
And Will, you sit way over there.
That's it? Even if nobody helps me,
I can eat that. No problem.
-At least give me a challenge.
-This is Chandler's chicken.
This is the turkey.
Oh. How big is that?
-About  pounds.
-You'd like that, wouldn't you?
What? Oh, can we please keep
the chicken..
and the turkey on the other side?
-The smell is just..
-Typical.
-What?
whatever she wants in Rachel-land.
Seriously, who is this guy?
Sorry, do you have a problem with me?
-I don't know. Do I? Do I?
-I think you do.
You were a little mean
to him in high school.
-A little mean? You made my life miserable.
Screw it. Bring on the yams.
But you worked so hard.
-Yams!
-Okay.
I'm real sorry for whatever
I did to you in high school.
It wasn't just me. We had a club.
-You had a club?
to hate me?
-Who else was in this club?
-Me and Ross.
No need to point.
She knows who Ross is.
-You were in an "I Hate Rachel" club?
-That exchange student from Thailand.
But I don't think he knew what it was.
You guys were cool.
So, Ross, we went out for two years..
and you never told me you were
in an "I Hate Rachel Club"?
You went out with her? We had a pact.
-It's not like it was binding forever.
-It had the word "eternity" in it.
I'm thinking of joining
you used to lock the bedroom door?
-Yeah.
-A little relieved, I gotta say.
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?
I was a stupid kid, okay?
-The only reason I joined..
was that I was in love with you.
I didn't handle it very well. If you think
about it, the "I Hate Rachel Club"..
was really
the "I Love Rachel Club."
Except that it was really
and say mean things about me?
-We did a little more than that.
-No, no, no.
What else did you do?
-We started a rumor.
-What rumor?
Come on, Will,
-It was no big deal.
We said that.. The rumor was that..
you had both male and female
reproductive parts.
-What?
-That's right. We said your parents..
flipped a coin, decided to raise you
-You started that?
-You heard that?
-Everyone at our school heard it!
Everyone at my school heard it.
You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader?
Oh, no!
It makes sense now. This is why
in this region.
Billy's gay now, so that one's
not really our fault.
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I thought it might be true.
I was afraid that you were gonna cry
It's not true!
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
Come on, whip it out.
You are my Everest.
-You don't have to finish.
-I do. Otherwise, what's next?
Today I can't finish a turkey,
but tomorrow I eat half a PowerBar..
wrap it up and put it
I thinking? Jeans have no give.
Guys, help me with the dishes.
There's a lot of pots and pans.
Honey, I'd love to,
but the second game is about to start.
Oh, yeah, the second game.
-Los Angeles.
Last time I checked,
Los Angeles didn't have a football team.
Did I say Los Angeles? I meant the team
that used to be in Los Angeles..
and is now in St. Louis.
on that team.
Gretzky..
Agassi..
I'm a pretty little girl.
Listen to what Sean McMahon
wrote in my yearbook senior year.
"Dear Rach, you're such a great
person." Not girl, "person."
I think you're reading a little
Sorry about your teeny weenie."
What do you want me to do..
call everyone in the entire school
and tell them it wasn't true?
-Yes.
-Also, tell them I'm skinny now.
Oh! Me too!
I won't call anybody.
that I was half and half!
I never did anything to hurt you
in high school.
That's not totally true.
-What?
-What?
You did start that rumor about Ross..
making out with Mrs. Altmann,
-No.
Yes, it is. I saw you guys going at it
behind the card catalog.
-Hey, what were you doing in the library?
-They had magazines.
Mrs. Altmann? She also made out..
with Ta-Taka-Ki-Kek the night
with a -year-old woman?
-Hey, she didn't look !
-Did she look ?
There's a picture of her
in the yearbook actually.
-Wow.
with the process..
having spent most of her life sitting
for oil paintings.
How did this happen? Did she lure
you to an early-bird dinner?
I was working late in the library
with her word jumble.
And one thing led to another.
If you must know,
Anita was very gentle and tender.
May she rest in peace.
-Didn't she walk with a cane?
-Only when it was damp!
I can't believe you told people
-Yeah!
-Shall I call the meeting to order?
-Is everybody present?
With the exception of Ta-Taka.
-I wanna join!
-Phoebe?
I'm sorry, but I never got to be in a club.
a dumpster to learn French.
Fine, you can have
your stupid, little club.
But what you did to me is way worse
than what I did to you.
-You gave me a teeny weenie.
Rachel, even with that rumor..
you were one of the most popular girls.
Everyone wanted to be like you.
One girl wanted to be like you so much,
she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll.
Wow.
And Ross, if it weren't for her rumor,
-As a romancer of the elderly.
Mrs. Altmann, you can tell,
she used to be pretty.
The eyes did still sparkle.
This stuff is so way in the past.
You've been through so much since then.
You got so much more
-We are having a baby together.
Hold on.
-You got her pregnant?
-Yeah.
-Are you getting married?
-No.
So you knocked her up but you're
-Okay.
It's exactly how I imagined
it would be.
All right, where's that turkey?
-Those are my maternity pants!
-No, these are my Thanksgiving pants!
Well, that's it. I'm done.
Here come the meat sweats.
Well, Joey, we're all
from the president any moment now.
-Anything we can do?
-No. Just nobody press on my stomach.
You can keep those pants, by the way.
What you got there?
What is that, pie?
-Yeah. You want some?
Cut me a real piece!
-Hey.
-Hey. So, what do you think?
New haircut? Necklace? Dress?
Boots? Boots!
Now, they're a little more than I usually
spend on boots. Or rent.
Did you say you bought "boots"
-I'm sorry. They just looked so good.
The saleswoman was like
-"These are too expensive for you."
-She had a point.
-Hey.
-Hi. Oh, my God.
-Oh, Monica, those boots are amazing.
-Return them? They're gonna hear you.
I'm not returning them. I know they
cost a lot, but I'll wear them all the time.
You'll see. Besides,
I love the compliments.
Have you ever had something
-Nice try. I'm keeping the boots.
That's right. I love you.
And I'm gonna play with you
all the time.
How can you let him talk
to your crotch like that?
-He's talking to the baby.
"I can't wait for your first words"..
I thought, "There's a trick."
Well, I gotta go, you guys.
I'll see you later.
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.
Hey, listen. Can you do me a favor? My
more Ralph Lauren clothes to prison.
-It is a waste.
-No, not her.
My youngest sister, Dina,
is interested in fashion.
She wants to talk to someone successful
-No, she wants to talk to you.
Really? Oh, my God. I'm successful.
-Okay, so would you meet with her?
-Yes, I'd love to. Have her come by.
Great, thanks. You'll love her. She's the
smartest of all the Tribbiani children.
-Yeah, you know the SATs?
-Yeah. Why?
-Sting has a son that goes there too.
-I know. He's in Ben's class.
You knew and never said anything? With
all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?
Fine, no more dinosaur stuff.
And there's a picture.
What are you reading, "The Kidnapper's
Guide to Manhattan Private Schools"?
It's New York Magazine. It's an article
about the city's best schools.
-So how well do you know Sting?
his concert Friday, but it's sold out.
I know! Why don't you
meet him and get tickets.
If you get two, I'll take you.
I'm picking Ben up tomorrow.
Maybe he'll be there.
There you go. You're so lucky.
-Hey.
Hi, Monica. Hi, boots.
See, Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out
of them already. They're very practical.
You can wear them
with dresses, skirts, pants..
You wear them with shorts on the corner
-They hurt so much.
-What?
-The guy who made these..
hates feet
and wants to see them die.
Give them to me.
all the time. I can't just give them away.
-Then get your money back and return them.
-I can't do that either.
The soles are scuffed up, and the
insides are filled with my blood.
-Hey.
a very thorough job.
I dropped him off at Carol's.
Anyway, it turns out I'm not gonna
get those tickets, though.
Oh, no. Why not?
It turns out Ben and Sting's son
do not get along.
-How come?
are "lesbenims."
Wait. If they don't get along, smooth
things over. Make them be friends.
-You can't force kids to be friends.
-Sure you can.
Give them some blocks.
-Your kid is ?
He's really small.
-Please get the tickets.
-I'm sorry. I just can't do it.
-Yes, you can. Sting says so himself.
-What?
Look, I'm sorry..
Phoebe?
Here she is future fashion superstar.
-Oh, Joey, I'm hardly..
-Hi.
Thanks so much for meeting with me.
Joey's told me so much about you.
This is so exciting for her.
-Ralph Lauren smiled at her in the elevator.
-You sure it was at you?
Because he likes it sometimes
get down to business.
You, be good, learn a lot. And if she takes
you to the freebie room, I need shirts..
but none with that creepy logo with
the guy riding the dog, holding the bone.
Okay. All right, Dina.
Well, let's talk about the different
need a whole other degree for that.
-Sales is great. You get to travel.
-I don't care about fashion.
I'm pregnant. And I know you are too,
so you gotta help me.
Then there's marketing.
-What's wrong?
-That's tonight?
I forgot all about the "secret Santa" gift.
Do we like this?
We don't really have to go to this thing,
do we?
I know that you don't like my office parties,
but you can wear your new boots.
See? Every cloud has
-Why not?
I'm worried your bosses will see them
and think they pay you too much money.
Or your assistant will see them
and want a raise.
Do you think I work some kind of
and the boots don't go with it.
You said those boots go with skirts,
dresses and pants.
What are you planning on wearing,
a chicken suit?
Fine. If you want me to,
and try the outfit on.
Christmas party in my boots!
I can't go in there. I can't tell him.
It's gonna be okay.
He has been incredibly supportive of me.
And if he gets a little upset,
that's what the meatball sub is for.
-Thank you.
-Why don't you sit down.
Dina has something
that she wants to tell you.
What's going on?
Is it Mom? Is she sick?
Is it Dad's heart?
Is that a sandwich?
-Mom and Dad are fine.
that you should know. Dina?
-I'm pregnant.
-What?
Now. Give him the sandwich!
Obviously, this is a mistake.
You can't be pregnant.
Because you have to have sex
I was , like you did.
What? Dina..
I can't believe this. You're the good one.
You went to college! Both years!
Who did this to you?
Bobby Corso. But he's a real nice guy.
I like him a lot. He's real funny.
You got pregnant for "funny"?
-Why? Where you going?
I can't look at you right now.
I know.
Oh, there you are, Ben.
You're Ben, right?
Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
I heard you're having a problem
with one of the boys.
So I thought I'd come and sit you both down,
have a little talk and make it all okay.
Now, the boy's name is Sting's son.
Jack? I hate him. He's a jerk.
Sometimes people may seem
is waiting for me over there.
Wow, your friend Doug
looks a lot like Billy Joel.
-Is that who his father is?
-No. His dad's a dentist.
Him, you're friends with.
-Excuse me, can I help you with something?
-I'm with Ben.
-Are you one of Ben's mothers?
-I am one of Ben's mothers.
I'm a lesbian.
It was difficult coming out
to my parents.
Well, hi. I'm Jenny Boon.
-That would make me Susan.
Right. Are you looking for Jack's parents
to discuss his problems with Ben?
I think the parents should sit down together
and have a conversation.
Yeah, let's do that!
That sounds good.
We should sit down and talk.
-Their number's on the contact sheet.
Could I get a copy of that?
Carol threw it out. She lost ours.
She's such a scatterbrain.
But, man, what a hot piece of ass.
-You know, that party wasn't bad.
-No, we can't walk.
No. Hey, there's a cab.
That's a police car.
Maybe we could commit a crime,
have them pick us up.
-It's  blocks to the subway. Come on.
-Okay.
Do you think we can get to the subway
-I can't walk, okay?
-These boots were a huge mistake.
-What?
You were right. I never should have bought
them. They're killing me, one toe at a time.
-So they're really tight, huh?
it feels like to be right.
It's oddly unsettling.
How are we gonna we get home?
Maybe a piggyback ride?
I don't think me getting on your back
is gonna improve matters.
Wow, being right sure doesn't help
-Okay, wait.
Let me just get my boots off first.
Oh, God.
I know you're in pain right now,
but I'm a little turned-on.
Do you ever worry that you'll be walking
and your baby will just slip out?
What college was that, Dina?
Oh, my God. Bobby?
Hi, Dina. Good to see you.
-Joey, what are you doing?
-This is crazy.
Don't interrupt me
when I'm talking to God!
-Where were we? Do you take this man..?
-No!
-You'll take him.
-Yes, I do.
-I heard "I do." We're halfway there. You.
-All right, Joey, that is enough!
As beautiful and moving
as this ceremony is, this is not legal.
They don't have a marriage license or
and hit me with it.
What am I supposed to do?
You're supposed to realize they are adults
and that can make their own decisions.
No, they can't. They were
stupid enough to get knocked up!
Contraceptives are not
-Come on, kids, a little help here!
Wow! This place is incredible!
Sting's pen..
that he gave to Phoebe.
Come on, secret passageway.
-Hi.
-Hi.
I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.
-Why else would I be here?
-Why don't you sit down.
I gather Jack and Ben
Ben's a bit of a "poo-poo-head."
-I'm sorry, won't Jack's father be joining us?
-No.
I see. You see, I think it would be better
for the children..
if all the parents were here. Except for,
Jack's father's not available.
Okay. Well, then, could we reschedule
No, I know that wouldn't work.
My husband's in concert.
Concert. Yeah.
and he's obviously busy during.
So I guess you and I should talk
about Jack and Ben right now.
Unless.. Unless..
Okay, I would be willing
to go to the concert..
all the while thinking
-Thank you. Four would be great.
I'm not giving concert tickets to someone
who'd use their son like this.
Then you're in luck. Ben's not my son.
Look, I've just pressed a button
triggering a silent alarm.
-Any minute now, the police will be here.
-Oh, I'm sorry. Do you need a break?
My boots in tan! Can you get a little closer
so I see the price?
I can see it from right here.
It'll cost you one husband.
I'm sorry. I can walk the rest
-I don't have them either. Where are they?
Why don't you check in one of my
saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay?
Okay. My God, we gotta go back
and get them!
Are you ever gonna wear the boots again?
Yes, I am. Okay? They're very practical.
-I could wear them with pants or skirts..
didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
You know what? You can say goodbye
to the tan ones.
-Okay. All right.
-Okay.
Bye, boots. Wait! Half off!
Just because they're not getting
-Oh, okay, let's hear their plan.
Now, what's the future look like
for Dina and Bobby?
Well..
I really have high hopes for my band.
-You were right. He is funny.
-Now, wait a minute.
I bet when you told people you wanted
tell us a little bit about your band.
Well, it's just me and my pal Rooster.
The band's name is Numbnuts.
Really?
If you're having a baby,
you should be married.
Even if it is to Bobby.
-So, what are you gonna do?
Have the baby and raise it by yourself?
Without a husband?
You can't be a single mother alone!
You're gonna ruin your life!
-Excuse me. Am I ruining my life?
who doesn't know what she's doing.
-Excuse me?
-One pregnant woman at a time, please!
I just want you to be okay.
So forcing her to marry Bobby
is gonna make that happen?
Maybe.
Yeah. So, what kind of music
think I can do it. I just need some help.
-Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.
-You bet I am.
And to answer your earlier question,
we're straight-up gangster rap.
Look, Rachel's told me how much easier
-Because you're my baby sister!
And you're my big brother. You're
my favorite guy in the whole world.
I'm not even scared to tell Mom and Dad.
I was scared of telling you.
I'd be scared of them, but all right.
I can't stand the thought of having
his Uncle Joey.
We'll be all right. Even if we're not
married, this baby will be so loved.
-And not just by us.
-That's right.
By his uncle too.
And by you.
Bobby, why don't we come over here and
We know each other.
So..
-anyway, guess what.
-Oh, there's more?
You're gonna love me so much.
I got Sting tickets!
Oh, my God, I do love you!
-Middle balcony.
Would you say that's
more than  yards away..
from Sting, his wife
or a member of his family?
-Yeah.
by the window. Wow!
That guy back there? He's awfully short.
And I think he's talking to himself.
And to be completely honest,
he's not that good in bed.
Really?
What is wrong with me lately?
I would be attracted to.
But right now,
with the way I'm feeling..
all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants
and fanny pack.
Wait a second! This is about the fourth
-This is completely normal.
Around the fourth month,
your hormones start going crazy.
-Really? So this has happened to you?
-Absolutely!
And keep in mind now,
I was thrice as randy.
Wow, this explains so much!
Last weekend, I went from store to store,
sitting on Santas' laps.
Yeah, I remember trying
to steal a cardboard cutout..
of Evander Holyfield
I'll ask her about this.
Maybe she can give me a pill
or something.
Yeah, that's what you need.
A good pill.
Oh, no. Short, crazy guy recognizes me.
from Rockefeller Center.
Great. Hey, Joey, want to check out
pictures of me and Mona ice-skating?
Ordinarily, I would love to,
but I am just swamped right now.
Where are the pictures that that creepy
Probably at the end.
Oh, my God! All he took were pictures
of my breasts.
I'm missing picture time!
You know, she has a face, Ross.
I didn't take these, okay? I didn't even
know my camera had a zoom lens.
"Comma, officer."
-Okay, here's a good one of us.
and the skaters and the snow.
Good job, pretzel pervert.
Every year, I say I'm gonna send out
holiday cards and I never do it.
Do you want
to send this one out together?
Together? Like, to people?
Yeah. "Happy holidays, from Mona
-Sure, sure.
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.
Congratulations! You just got married!
I know. Can you believe that?
I'm sorry. What's the big deal
about a holiday card?
Married couples send out cards.
a couple of months don't send out cards.
-What is she, crazy?
-That's your wife you're talking about!
No, really. I mean,
that would be like a huge step forward.
I like things just the way they are.
I'm finally in a relationship
I'd be divorced by now.
Okay, so just tell her you don't wanna
send out the card. What's she gonna do?
This.
Oh, okay. I didn't mean
to put pressure on you..
I just thought it would be something fun
it's not that big a deal. I'll do the card.
-What? I said I'd do it.
-I know, it's just..
Can I have $?
-Hi. You ready for lunch?
-One second.
-That's cute.
in the office today.
-Oh, honey, you remember my boss, Doug.
-Yes. Hi.
Good news! The divorce is final.
I signed the papers this a.m.
I didn't know you and Kara divorced.
of that bear trap.
-Congratulations to you guys, though.
-No leg-chewing for us, sir.
Well, give it time.
So the divorce, the marriage,
we got a lot to celebrate.
How about we all go out
of anything we're doing.
Why can't I think
of anything we're doing?
Tomorrow night it is.
I should be out of court by .
They keep throwing sexual harassment
out of the park!
Okay, see you tomorrow.
Just so you know,
we're not seeing him tomorrow.
Honey, once you get to know him,
he's much, much worse.
I can't do this alone.
Honey, I'm sorry. I can't help you. I can't
at our wedding?
That's because he wasn't invited.
Because of the way he behaved
at our engagement party.
Oh, yeah! Urine cuts right through
an ice sculpture, doesn't it?
Oh, what the hell? B plus.
Hi! I went by the photo shop.
What do you think?
Wow, that's great.
Do you think it should say,
"Love, Ross and Mona"?
Well, we haven't said that
to each other yet..
but I guess it's okay
-A hundred?
Well, I guess I'll take..
Mona?
I'm not sure
about the whole card thing.
Really? Why not?
Sending out a holiday card together?
I just don't know
if we're really quite there yet.
I didn't think of it that way.
-Yeah.
Where are we?
You know, where are we?
Where is this relationship going?
I love spending time with you.
I just hope we're moving forward.
We should talk about that,
-The card! I think we're there!
Okay. But I still think
we should have this conversation.
Really?
Even with the card?
Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here
today, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.
Oh, okay.
who took my blood sample really cute?
You know who I'm talking about?
Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?
Actually, never mind.
I just answered my own question.
-Hi, Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff.
-Oh, God, yes.
So, how's it going?
It's going really good.
But enough about me! Come on.
Where are you from?
What do you do?
-I'm a doctor.
Do you cook? So you ski?
Or just hang out with your wife,
or girlfriend?
I don't have a wife or a girlfriend,
but I do like to ski.
I love to ski!
-No, I'm very comfortable.
-Any painful gas?
-No!
Dr. Schiff!
What kind of question is that?
Okay, then. Would you like
to lie down on the table?
-Is there something going on here?
-Do you feel it too?
-Hi.
-How did your doctor's appointment go?
Well, let's see,
I put my pinkie in his chin dimple.
-Oh, my God!
-Why did you do that?
Remember that little problem I was having
during my fourth month of pregnancy?
Oh, yeah!
you practically came on to me.
You wish.
Hey, I could have had you
if I wanted you.
Oh, yeah? Come and get it.
Okay, even this is turning me on.
You guys, I got problems.
Oh, hey. Hey, Ross!
You'll be getting our card.
You're doing a holiday card?
We're not just doing a card.
She also wants to have the conversation..
about where the relationship
is going.
Women!
I know! Why do you guys need
"So where is this going?"
Ross, you asked me that.
You were a closed book, okay?
I'm not a mind reader!
What are you gonna say to her?
Where is this relationship going?
I don't know. I really like her
-No, I can't.
Because then she's gonna say,
"Well, it's not moving anywhere..
-then we should just break up."
-Yeah, that's true.
Besides, I hate those conversations.
forward without having to talk about it.
Like asking her
to move in with you?
Smaller than that.
-Making her a mix tape?
-Bigger than that.
-Give her a key to your apartment.
You could say, "I love you."
I don't think I'm quite there yet.
But I could say,
"I love spending time with you."
-We hate that.
-That is a slap in the face.
Forget it. You know what?
they are, and hope for the best.
What do you think, Rach?
I think if it was
a little colder in here..
I could see your nipples
through that sweater.
Bing? We're all set for tonight, .
As it turns out, we can't do it.
into her mother "work."
Fine. Tomorrow night then.
-Tomorrow's no good for her, either.
-Why not?
It's the semifinals..
of her bocce ball tournament.
Okay. The night after that then.
Well, that's the finals, and I think
she's gonna go all the way, sir.
What's going on, Bing? Does your wife
go out together?
Because we split up.
Monica and I split up.
Hold me.
Good God, Bing. Well, I can't say
I'm altogether surprised.
I saw the way she looked at you,
and there was no love there.
And the way she looked at me,
this tough time is choking someone.
I know how you feel. Oh, yeah.
I know what it's like to give a woman
all your love..
and then have that love
thrown back in your face.
And then the court decides to give you
we're gonna get you over this.
Here's the plan Grab your coat,
we're going to a strip club!
Oh, no!
Monica would freak.
But to hell with that bitch!
Here we go.
Mona, it's time we had a conversation
And I love hanging out with you.
And I'm having a lot of fun.
Okay.
There's no point in spending time
with someone if it's just fun.
It's gotta be going somewhere, right?
So where is it going?
That's the real question.
And the answer is..
it's going somewhere..
fun.
I know what you're thinking.
Fun was fine for you  years ago.
But you're not getting any younger.
No! I mean, not you.
What's your secret?
I'm sorry, so where are we?
Well, to sum up..
we're having fun.
You look young.
-Okay..
-But that's not enough.
So..
here's a key to my apartment.
-Really?
to your apartment?
Not just a key.
I gave her the only key!
I am now a homeless person
in a very serious relationship!
-Why did you give her a key?
you didn't wanna have..
and you made the gesture
you didn't wanna make.
Did I start this by saying, "Hey,
I did something awesome today"?
-Do either of you have a key to my place?
-Great. I live on the street.
Where?
-Hi.
-Okay, Monica, Rachel..
-this is my friend Roger.
-Hi, Roger.
I'll get us some drinks.
-You're welcome.
-Phoebe, no!
-It's okay. He's a virgin.
Rachel, I was talking to this guy.
I think he'll have sex with you.
Let's leave these two alone.
No! I don't care what my hormones are
he was really looking forward to this!
Bing! Look at those twin sisters
dancing together.
Let me buy you a lap dance
with those girls.
That's all right, sir.
-It's a hand.
It's a thing you use
as a Jack and Coke holder.
It's a wedding ring. Get rid of it.
We'll throw it in the East River!
-No!
might even hit a seagull in the head.
Okay. I'm gonna need a bunch
of extra keys.
Apparently, I give them away
for no reason at all.
Ross, what's going on?
and then you change the lock?
Good luck, buddy.
I thought we were moving forward. Now
you're sending me all these mixed signals.
What are you trying to tell me?
I'm trying to tell you..
I made you a mix tape.
-What?
-I love you.
And I love spending time with you.
-Hi, honey, I'm home.
I told him you and I split up.
So then he took me to these strip clubs
and sleazy bars.
When I wouldn't give him my wedding
ring, he threw a soda can at a bird.
Come here.
-You know what the worst part was?
I got to see what my life
would be like without you.
It was like It's a Wonderful Life
with lap dances.
Please promise me
with each other for the rest of our lives.
I promise.
Speaking of together, how about
we send out a holiday card this year?
I don't know if we're there yet.
I'd like to order a pizza.
Can I ask you a question?
Is the cute blond guy delivering tonight?
-Who was that?
-It's just the pizza place.
-You hung up on the pizza place?
I don't hang up on your friends.
-Sorry, honey, I'm just having a rough day.
-What's wrong?
-You don't want to hear about it.
lately, with this whole pregnancy thing..
I'm just finding myself..
How do I put this?
Erotically charged.
Is that college talk for "horny"?
Yeah. I have all of these feelings,
and I don't know what to do about them.
I can't date like a normal person, which is
fine because I don't need a relationship.
All I really want is one great night!
No relationship.
With someone I feel comfortable with,
and who knows what he's doing.
For just one great night.
I mean, is that really so hard..
to find?
So how was your day?
Good. I saw a pretty big pigeon.
Well, I gotta get up early,
-Good night!
Good night!
-I can't do it!
-I didn't ask you to do it!
-You're Rachel!
-You're Joey!
-You're my friend!
and weird and bad!
So bad! But I don't know what you're talking
about. I didn't ask you to do anything!
I know!
-You wanna do it?
-No!
-I'm just testing you!
-Never happened!
-Good night!
-Good night!
Get back in there!
Listen, I'm sorry about
that whole thing with Roger.
It really wasn't right.
I think you'll really enjoy.
Now this is just a loan, okay?
I'm gonna want him back.
I'm gonna go now.
I'm sorry.
I thought I could do it, and I can't.
Did we get paper towels?
You mean the thing
and it's finally here!
You didn't have to get us anything..
I love it! It's huge! Let's open it!
-It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!
-Oh, my God!
I didn't know where to put it.
-We can put it in the guest bedroom.
-Yeah, okay.
I kind of like it here.
Do you like it?
I practically spent my
-What's your first?
-I don't remember the name.
-Well, what did it do?
You'd put a quarter in,
pull some handles and win a candy bar.
A vending machine?
Don't feel bad for me.
in the paleontology department.
Do you think he saw us,
or can we still slip out?
Professor Newman, the department head,
is retiring, so..
-They made you head of the department!
of the department?
Great. You've always wanted
to teach an advanced class.
No, I know. It's really exciting.
This is the break I've been waiting for.
I'm not sure a court-ordered
Professor Newman was waiting for.
But, hey.
Hey, Rach, I got a big date.
Do you know a good restaurant?
Paul's Cafe. It's got great food
and it's really romantic.
Great, thanks.
Then take her to the
and listen to some jazz.
Or dancing. Oh, take her dancing!
You sure are naming
a lot of ways to postpone sex.
I miss dating. Dressing up,
going to a fancy restaurant.
I won't be able to do that for so long.
worrying about giving birth isn't fun.
Hey, you know what?
Why don't I take you out.
You don't want to date
a pregnant lady.
Yes, I do. We're gonna
and C-sections..
and baby heads stretching out..
Okay, I'll go with you.
-It will be fun.
-All right.
No, no! Yes!
Would you look at that.
I knocked off all your top scores.
How sad.
Okay, I'm next.
Don't start another game.
over all the winning.
-Phoebe's hogging the game.
-It's a stupid game.
You think it's stupid because
you suck.
I don't suck. It sucks.
You suck.
If this game is gonna cause problems,
for the thank-you card?
-Why do you want to play this game?
-It doesn't spit out a Clark Bar.
Okay. Phoebe, that's it.
Out of the chair.
Phoebe!
I'm hoping it will turn into love-play.
Okay, look.
Honey, I'm sorry..
I'm acting hostile. I don't mean to.
It's just that I love this game so much..
that I would just like
with you yapping around my head..
like a Chihuahua.
All right, that's it. Chandler,
help me get her out of the chair.
Chandler, come on.
Joey, could you get that?
Joey.
I thought you were in your room.
I'm picking you up for our date.
For you.
Lilies. They're my favorite.
and I felt faint, so..
This is so great! I actually feel
like I'm on a real date.
But I have morning sickness and
I have on underwear that goes up to..
there.
Hey, come on. This is a real date.
So nice place you got here.
Football. Pizza box.
Oh, a subscription to Playboy.
He sounds like a standup guy.
He's protective of me,
so you'd better watch yourself.
Your roommate, is he good-looking?
Must be tough to keep your hands
off him.
I'm pretty sure he's gay.
No! No, he's not! Why are you trying
to Greely's Theory of Dominance.
That's it for today.
Does anyone know where
the Freeman Building is?
It's the new building on Avenue A.
That's across town.
I'm teaching there in  minutes.
Dude, that's not gonna happen.
Move it! Move it!
Hey! I'm the teacher!
Hello.
Sorry I'm a little late.
by introducing myself.
I'm Professor Geller.
So to sum up..
I'm Professor Geller.
Good job today.
-What comes with the filet mignon?
-Steamed vegetables.
Instead of the vegetables..
is there any way that I could
to be a pretty good date.
I almost forgot.
I didn't pay you the rent.
No roommate stuff. It's a date.
Wow, so I get to see what
Joey Tribbiani is like on a date.
Have any moves?
No, I'm just myself,
get through that.
I knew it. Tell me your moves.
All right.
Well..
I start by having a bottle of wine
sent to my table from a fan.
Oh, my God. And that works?
If you add, "This is embarrassing.
I just want to have a normal life."
You poor little famous man.
Okay, how about this one?
I was gonna wait until the end
I don't think I can.
Oh, my God!
Wow, that was fantastic!
I almost leaned in. Really.
So tell me one of your moves.
All right.
So where'd you grow up?
That's your move?
Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.
-Come on, just answer the question.
-Queens.
Were you close to your parents?
-With my mom. Not so much my dad.
There's just this distance.
We both try to pretend it's not there,
but it is.
It's gotta be rough.
Yeah, it's really tough.
Sometimes I think..
Wow!
Nice move!
-"Where'd you grow up?" So simple.
I'm gonna use the restroom.
-Now you're watching me walk away.
-Yes, I am! So simple!
-You won't believe what I did today.
-Clearly not shower or shave.
I played this all day,
to "Ms. Chandler."
Although, I hope they don't.
You stayed home and played Ms. Pac-Man
while I went to work like a chump?
I got the top  scores. I erased
Phoebe off the board. High-five!
What is the matter with your hand?
I played for eight hours.
It'll loosen up. Check out the scores.
Also, look at the initials.
-Because it's awesome.
You think it's clever?
They only give you three letters,
so after A-S-S, it is a challenge.
But clearly you're up to the task.
-This one's not dirty.
-Put it together with that one.
Oh.
If you don't clear this off,
This can't be there.
-He won't know what they mean.
-He's , not stupid.
-Have you talked to him lately?
-I'm gonna unplug it.
I'll have nothing to show for my day.
of primitive ROM chip!
Wow. The dirty words
and the computer talk.
This is just the coolest
you've ever been.
-You gotta beat your scores.
We gotta get this off.
Carol's still upset that
you taught him "Pull my finger."
Pull my finger. My hand is messed up!
-I am not gonna answer that.
-Oh, come on. Just pick one.
Between Monica, Phoebe,
who would you punch?
We're friends.
I wouldn't punch any of them.
Chandler?
Yeah, but I don't know why.
-I'm having a wonderful time!
-Me too!
-This is the best date I ever had.
see the wine come out my nose?
Joey, I think everybody saw it.
I never knew I could enjoy
the non-sex part of a date so much.
That's because you have never
been on a date with me before.
All right. Now don't judge me.
I normally wait till my date leaves,
from that brownie.
Oh, yeah.
So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's
end-of-the-night moves?
Well, if I want the girl to kiss me..
first, I make my lips
look irresistible.
How do you do it?
Now you can't tell anyone, but..
I put on shiny lip balm.
-Oh, my God.
-No, I don't want to tell you.
-Why not?
-It's embarrassing.
More embarrassing than
shiny raspberry lip balm?
I didn't say raspberry before, did I?
Just tell me, Rach. Just tell me.
Okay.
All right, stand up.
Well, when we're at the door..
I lightly press my lips
just for a second.
And then I make this sound
It doesn't sound like anything,
but it works.
Oh, yeah. That would work, yeah.
All right, I gotta go to bed.
I had such a wonderful time.
Me too.
You were  minutes late?
"Get out of my way"?
Why didn't you take a cab?
With the traffic and one-way streets,
it'd take me twice as long.
And I have class three times a week.
Who am I, Rockefeller?
You won't be able to keep doing this.
If I don't, they'll take the class
-You've seen it, The Geller Yeller.
Right. Wow.
I figured out a faster route.
I'm sure I can make it this time.
I just can't be afraid
to get a little bit hit by cars.
-Hey.
Citizen Kane?
Yeah, it's really boring.
But it's, like, a big deal.
Anyway, I was thinking
about renting Cujo.
Well, let's do it tonight.
-Don't you have that big date?
-Yeah.
After our date, did you feel weird?
Oh, my God. You did too?
It freaked me out. What was that?
I don't know. I'm kind of thinking
it was the lobster.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the lobster.
-I was up sick all night.
in my hamper.
Okay, I got that.
I'll escape there.
I'll come back here.
All right. Come on, Ms. Pac-Man.
Well, you're just a little bitch,
aren't you?!
Hey, you guys?
I'm sorry that I was
I will cut you.
Oh, my God! Your friends have
some unfortunate initials.
They're all Chandler.
Chandler couldn't get this good.
I did. But it came at a price.
Ben's coming, and he can't see this.
By age , kids have
already seen orgies.
Was it just me?
So..
we're about out of time.
Now, I know I've given
a little overwhelming.
But, if there's one thing..
you need to take away
from class today..
it's that..
dinosaurs ain't never coming back.
I'll see you next time.
Yes, I made it! I'm on time!
Okay, why don't we all..
open our books to page ..
where..
where you will see..
a bunch of red spots.
Okay, why don't you all start to read
while I..
This is so embarrassing.
I just want to have a normal life.
Wow, that's an expensive
don't normally do that.
Are you all right?
You seem a little distracted.
No, no, I'm fine. It's just..
Hey, can I ask you something?
Have you ever looked at someone
you know..
and suddenly seen them
and he seemed totally normal.
And then he turned around
and it was Stephen Baldwin!
Yeah.
So you know exactly what I mean.
Totally! Wow.
-Would you excuse me?
-Sure.
-Phoebe! You're on fire!
-Don't touch her!
Go left! Go right! Go right!
I can't! I can't!
No! You son of a..
Phoebe?!
Oh, hi, Ben.
No, don't look at the machine!
Thank God you're home!
I'm watching Cujo.
-Alone?
throws himself at the car?
No, seriously,
what's wrong with the dog?
Wait, what happened to your date?
Oh, it didn't work out.
-Want to watch the rest of the movie?
-Oh, okay. Yeah.
I never thought I'd say this..
but I hope this dog dies.
What are you doing?
-I know.
It's gonna be okay.
Oh, my God. What's he gonna do now?
I can't watch.
How can you watch this?
Aren't you scared?
Terrified.
So is everybody here?
unearthed in two main locations.
Here..
and..
here.
Now, as for the hydrosaurs..
All right, it's a new day.
That stuff about Rachel?
You don't feel that now. It was crazy.
You're fine. You're better than fine.
You are, as your friend Tony
She's just your friend, Rachel.
Your friend, Rachel.
Your friend. Rachel.
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!
Are you..? Are you high?
I just had the most amazing bath.
-Really? I don't like baths.
It's the wet, naked lady.
-Baths are so relaxing.
-Really? What do you do?
You just sit in there,
stewing in your own filth.
How dirty do you think I am?
If you had some candles and bubbles
and I'm watching Road Rules.
How stressed do you think I am?
Hey, Chandler. You got a minute?
I really need to talk to you.
Oh, yeah. Is this a cold-pizza talk
or a leftover-meat loaf talk?
Well, neither.
Oh, my God, what's up?
I don't know. It's just..
Lately, I've been feeling..
Okay, here's what it is.
You know what?
mon frere.
-Who?
-Just come back.
Okay.
You and Monica,
friends for a long time.
And sure, there are rules.
there too, you know what I mean?
Do you?
It was different for you guys.
You were both in the same place, right?
-In London?
-Yeah.
Yes, when Monica and I were
Forget all about it.
And listen, do me a favor,
this conversation between you and me.
If that.
How do I keep losing at tic-tac-toe?
Oh, no, no, honey.
My circle always stays in the middle.
Oh, Ross, don't forget we have
-No. We don't wanna know.
All we care about
is that it's happy and healthy.
Yep, happy and healthy. And cute.
-And smart. With an aptitude for science.
-Popular.
Are you two talking
-Oh, yeah. I've come up with a bunch.
-Really? Me too.
-Me too.
Really?
If it's a girl, Phoebe.
And if it's a boy, Pheebo.
Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt
-Okay.
I was thinking if it's a girl..
how about Sandrene? It's French.
That's a really pretty name
for an industrial solvent.
-Okay, fine. What do you have?
-It's for a boy.
I know it's a little out there, but..
Darwin.
Oh, my God. Our child will be beaten
because I said no to your name.
I'm really, really not.
How about you each get five vetoes?
-That sounds fair.
-I don't think you'll need it. Check this out.
If it's a girl, Rain.
-Veto.
-Why?
Rain? "Hi, my name is Rain.
I have my own kiln,
from her at a Dead show!
-Okay. How about for a guy, Thatcher?
-Why do you hate our child?
-Fine, you go.
-Okay. James.
-But only if it's a girl.
Are we having an -year-old?
-How about Dayton?
-Veto. Stewart.
Veto. Sawyer.
-Veto. Helen.
-Veto.
Is it me, or is Veto starting
get over that idea.
-What is it?
-I drew you a bath.
I don't like baths. Could you draw me
a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
Please. Will you just try it for me.
I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.
And got you this little plastic
Navy ship! So it's a boy bath.
-This does butch it up a bit.
-I swear, if you try it, you will love it.
If I do this, can we at least discuss
that discussion's gonna go.
All right, this isn't so bad.
I like the flowery smell.
Which is okay,
because I've got my boat.
I can actually feel my tension
-Oh, my God.
I told you you were a bath person.
Hey, maybe I can give you a facial.
I'm gonna need a bigger boat.
I don't think you had an open mind
about the name Ruth.
I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller?
hear the mahjong tiles.
Okay. All your tests look fine. Are you
interested in knowing the sex of the baby?
-No, we're not.
-But you have it right there in that file?
You could tell us
Phoebe or Pheebo?
That's right.
But if you don't wanna know..
-No, we wanna wait. Right?
-Right. Right.
Oh, I'll be right back.
I know it's really not my place..
but please don't name
do you think is the ugliest?
What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.
They're babies.
They're all beautiful.
-Third one from the left?
-Yeah. Why is it staring at me?
I think it knows I'm talking about it.
-I saw you!
Fine, I did,
but I didn't see anything.
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
-Okay. But listen to me, I didn't..
-Don't tell me! I don't wanna know!
I couldn't even if I wanted to,
to know. It was just a momentary lapse.
Momentary lapse?
Don't you have any self-control?
Okay. A couple months late
on the lecture, Ross.
Hello?
I'm in the bathroom. Can you come in here?
I think I'll wait out here.
I'm in the bathtub.
-What's wrong?
-I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong.
The water's tepid, the salt didn't dissolve
and is now lodged places.
And the scents I used don't compliment
-Bath salts.
They're starting to effervesce.
It's different.
It's interesting.
Okay. Let's talk about something else.
Yeah. Sure. So, what was
going on with you today?
I actually had the weirdest
conversation with Joey.
He was talking about rules
-You did? What was he talking about?
He hasn't had this much trouble getting
out words since we saw him in Macbeth.
That was a long night.
All right, let's break this down.
What exactly did he say to you?
He was talking about rules
-What'd he tell you?
He was asking questions
about you, me and London.
And the glue that holds
this all together, the rules.
Okay. So you, me and London.
Looking at people differently.
Maybe he wants to do what you and I
the minute Phoebe came in.
-Because he was looking at her differently.
-And Phoebe is his friend.
So he thinks that would be
breaking the rules.
My God, he wants to do it
-Just a minute!
-That's Mrs. Tribbiani.
-You don't say anything.
Why would I say anything?
That two of our friends could start
the greatest love affair of their lives?
They would have me to thank.
-You just stay here.
Oh, God!
Hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
Oh, you had that? I thought I lost it.
I got a new one a month ago.
Oh, just as well. I broke this one.
-What?
-Nothing.
I really shouldn't say.
that you can't tell me.
Somebody likes you!
Is it Chandler?
-No!
-Then tell him to stop staring.
It's Joey.
Really? Joey? You don't say.
-Is it something you'd be interested in?
-I don't know, I don't know.
You know, I mean, on the one hand,
what we have.
I guess that makes sense.
You think you're gonna talk to him?
Sure. I mean, it's Joey.
I don't want him to get hurt.
Well, I must say, I am on fire!
-Sure.
You know what? I've been thinking about it.
I'm coming around on the name Ruth.
I think I would actually consider
naming our child that.
Rach, I can't tell you
Why would you change your mind?
Unless you know we're never
gonna have to use it.
You did see. You know it's a boy!
I didn't see anything.
I actually changed my mind about the name.
I don't think so.
when it's a boy.
That's when you'll swoop in and
name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
I would.. Sequoia!
-Veto.
-Fine.
Unless..
you anticipated
it actually is a girl.
And you really do want her
to be named Ruth.
Well, I'm not falling for that!
Okay? Ruth is off the table!
-But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.
-What?
-I know.
-What?
-I know about your feelings.
-Oh, my God, you do?
I'm sorry. Things worked out for
complicated than it was for those guys.
I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.
For God's sakes, it's Rachel!
I know! She's not only my friend,
she's my pregnant friend.
She's my pregnant friend
who's Ross 'ex!
Yeah, that's Rachel.
Beat me over the head with it.
What am I gonna do? I keep trying
of everything I don't like about her.
-You wanna hear it?
-Yeah.
"She made me switch to light mayo."
That's it! That's all I got!
You know what? Tastes the same
nothing. This is probably just a crush.
You think?
Absolutely. You get this rush
of feelings, but then it goes away.
Yeah, just a crush.
That's all this is. It's a crush!
I'm Joey. I don't get deep feelings.
There you go.
Except for Ross and Chandler.
-And I'm sure you've had them for us.
-Not really.
Throw me a bone here.
So I called the doctor.
-Now we both know the sex of the baby.
-What?
That's right.
-Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.
A what?
You really didn't know?
-We're having a girl?
-No.
-That's what you said.
-No.
-You said girl.
but still, we're having a girl!
I know! You know what?
I'm putting Ruth back on the table.
Yes, we'll have ourselves
a little baby Ruth.
-Permission to veto.
I was just gonna get a magazine.
What do you think you're doing?
Leaving my troubles behind?
I know that you're new at this,
but this is unacceptable bath decorum.
It's so hard to care
when you're this relaxed.
Okay, fine. You can have the bath,
and let you know how it went.
You told her?
She pulled it out of me!
She's like a conversational wizard!
-How did it go?
-You were wrong. He doesn't like me.
How would you like it if I sent you
and you went there..
and you found out that he didn't like you.
How would you feel?
-I don't think I'd care.
-Really? Lee Majors is hot.
-Hello?
-Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
-What are you guys doing in here?
-Oh, my God.
A friend he's looking at differently,
but it's wrong.
-It's Rachel!
It's a crush. It'll go away.
Dude, you gotta rearrange
your bubbles.
Mazel tov.
Ross and I were looking for you.
What are we all doing in here?
Oh, my.
-Honey, cover it up with the boat.
and we'd love for you to join us!
Well, hey! What's going on?
Oh, cool boat. Oh, no.
-Did you tell them?
-No. I was waiting for you.
-Tell us what?
And it's just a crush.
That's all. Just a little crush.
All that worrying I was doing?
That was crazy.
Like my friend the bird here
would say, "It was cuckoo!"
Everything's gonna be fine.
-I love you.
It's nice to do this together,
isn't it?
Yeah. And what you're doing
feels so good.
I'm not touching you.
-You're not?
new realms of pleasure.
Whatever keeps you
off the balcony, big guy.
-What's up?
-I left my guitar here.
Okay. No problem.
Okay. Here you go.
-What?
-Exactly.
-Can I play for you?
-No.
Hey, Pheebs, what's up?
You ask an intriguing question,
Chandler Bing.
Oh, my God! You're getting a massage?
Don't let Phoebe in.
How long has this been going on?
-Well, Alexandra has..
-It has a name?
Phoebe, don't get upset.
Okay. Oh, too late! I'm leaving.
Come on, Chandler, let's go.
Well, I thought I'd..
Yeah, what the hell.
One more push.
and we're having this baby. I love you.
I love you too.
I hope it's not
an inappropriate time to say..
you're the best sex I've ever had.
That's always appropriate.
Okay, come on, one more push.
One more push.
There we go.
Here is your beautiful baby.
than you are a friend!
Joey!
-What's going on?
-Come feel my belly.
-The baby's kicking for the first time.
-Really?
Yes.
You know what? Maybe you..
Maybe you should come to me.
She's like..
Who's that annoying
girl soccer player?
-Mia Hamm?
-Mia Hamm!
-It's amazing.
Faye Bing. They don't like us, do they?
Who says you can't get
a nice punch bowl for under $?
-Maybe we can take it back.
-Where would we return it?
How about to the street,
What if they come by for a visit?
Let's cross that bridge when my aunt
and uncle who I haven't seen in  years..
drop by unexpectedly and
demand a giant bowl of punch.
Why don't we just find a place for it?
In that cabinet?
That's for canned goods. Have you
-No, I'll do it.
You have to relax and let me
take care of things once in a while.
It's locked. You have to help me.
Why is it locked?
No reason.
and I've never seen what's in there.
What is in there?
Feminine stuff.
Don't try to make me uncomfortable
with feminine stuff!
Nothing in there concerns you.
If you love me, you'll just let it go.
-Fine.
Lovely day, huh? You.
If it helps, Alexandra's only
been massaging her for three years.
If! I said, if it helps.
Why won't you let me massage you?
I'd be self-conscious.
You're my friend. I'd be naked.
We lived together for years.
And when?
I'm curious about the human body.
You can understand
why this would be weird.
I'm a professional
and I'm really good.
If you're uncomfortable, we can stop.
if you couldn't share your cooking?
Or how Ross would feel
if he couldn't teach us about dragons.
-Dinosaurs.
-Potato, potahto.
Ross, the baby's kicking.
What? It is?
It's not kicking now.
Although we would love
and he was sleeping.
A dreamless sleep.
My God, the baby's kicking.
That's great.
I wish I would have been there to feel
the kicking for the first time.
I got some stuff going on
stuff. Here's my pager number.
Anytime anything pregnancy-related
happens, use it.
I don't care if it's  a.m.
and you want ice cream.
Can I get a copy of that?
-Are you under the sheet?
-No.
That's right, you just enjoy.
Oh, yeah!
-Oh, yeah!
-Okay.
Oh, God, Phoebe!
That's it! That's it, right there!
I wasn't trying to open
your closet, I swear.
Monica runs a pretty tight ship here,
She won't let me see it.
-Why not?
-I don't know! What's she hiding?
I don't know.
I bet it's Richard.
-What?
-Before you say I'm wrong..
let me ask you something.
When was the last time you saw him?
Why would she keep Richard in here?
Off the top of my head..
maybe she's having her cake
Richard being the "too."
-That was off the top of your head?
-Yeah.
-Or..
-And here we go.
I saw a movie where there was a door.
millions of bugs came pouring out..
and they feasted on human flesh!
It wouldn't kill you
to respect your wife's privacy!
Stupid closet full of bugs!
Joey, something feels weird
and not good weird. I don't..
When my sisters were pregnant..
they got weird feelings
-Absolutely.
But we'll stop by the hospital
just to be sure. I'll page Ross.
Rach, look at me. Everything's fine.
Trust me. Take my hand. Here we go.
Crushing bones!
Good thing we're going to a hospital.
-Open it.
There's bugs everywhere.
-So?
-She's fine.
She had Braxton Hicks contractions.
Mild discomfort in the uterine wall.
Mild discomfort? I take it you've had
-Yes.
-There's no danger?
-No.
Contractions can be unnerving,
but she's fine.
Thank you, doctor.
more scared in my life.
-You said everything was okay.
-What do I know? I'm not a doctor.
-But everything is okay. I'm fine.
-You sure?
Yes. I got half a mind
What's he talking about?
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.
Your page said, "Come to
the hospital." What happened?
Something called
Most women don't feel them.
No uterus, no opinion.
What's with the candy?
I was at the concession stand
at the movies.
-You went to the movies by yourself?
-Mona!
-I gotta go back in there.
-No, really, tell me. What's up?
Look, I forgot my underwear.
Thanks for bringing her to the hospital.
Don't worry about it. No big deal.
But still, it should have been me.
I'm the dad.
-Here's information on Braxton Hicks.
-Thanks.
You did the right thing by bringing her in.
You'll make a wonderful father.
Hey, not as good as this guy.
-Easy there, Captain Kirk.
-Do you have a bobby pin?
-Yeah.
Oh, no, wait.
I'm not a -year-old girl.
Then why do you throw like one?
-Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
crush on Rachel coming?
Really good. I should be ready
to kill myself any day now.
Well, you sure found that quick.
I wish I didn't feel this way about
Rachel. I wish things could be normal.
I love living with her, and
the doctor thought I was the father.
You should have seen
the look on Ross' face.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
For all I know, I'm locking it more.
-You try opening it with a credit card?
-It's not your fault.
What are you gonna do, not take her?
You're doing nothing wrong.
Except for harboring love
for the woman carrying his baby.
Well, there is that.
Richard, if you're in there,
That massage felt so good.
No, I got that.
-Can we make it a weekly appointment?
-Okay.
You should know though,
I've raised my rates to $ an hour.
-Okay.
-.
What's going on?
You make sex noises
when you get massaged.
It freaked me out. After a while,
I tried to hurt you. It spurred you on.
You're crazy. There's nothing sexual
when she gives me a massage.
It's not because she hates Enya.
This is embarrassing.
I'm never getting a massage again.
Don't let this stop you
from getting massages.
I have lots of clients
-Well, not clients. Lovers.
We'll try it again. Come back,
and we'll work through it.
-You sure?
-Yes.
-I guess.
I learned a new trick.
You know, if you stick one hand down your
pants, you're the spitting image of Joey.
Hey, I brought you some lunch.
Oh, that's so sweet of you. Oh, yum.
-Did you put pickles on this?
-Well, yeah.
What? What? Rach, what?
-What's going on?
it's gone when I get out?
I'm on it!
I shouldn't be the one making her throw up.
-It could happen to anyone.
-Not to you. You know this stuff.
I don't know any of it and I'm the father.
I wish I could be more involved, you know?
Well, if anyone is keeping score,
I no longer eat tuna.
Can I talk to you guys for a second?
-Yeah.
I wanna talk about our situation.
Are you breaking up with us?
The thing is..
because I live with Rachel,
I'm here for a lot of stuff.
And Ross is missing everything. So..
Yeah?
You two should live together.
Are you asking me to move?
You don't want me here?
No, I love living with you.
it may as well be the father.
But, Joey, I don't think Ross wants me
to move in and disrupt his life.
Or he does.
I would love to be around
for you and the baby.
We can just try it,
-It wouldn't be anything romantic.
I'm dating Mona. Damn it, Mona!
I was supposed to meet her
an hour ago. What is wrong with me?
So, what do you think?
Living with the father of the baby.
It's a little conventional for us.
Yeah, but hey, hey.
you could have a closet dedicated to shoes.
Oh, you do know your audience.
-I don't know. Is it crazy?
-No.
Joey, this is a smart idea.
Well, I was due.
-Let's do it.
-Really?
Rach, that's great. That's great.
And you know what?
In fact, I'll start right now.
Ross, Ross. Mona?
Unbelievable.
Not too shabby.
I got this all off myself..
using my wife's tools.
Oh, my God.
How did you get in there?
You're messy.
-No! You weren't supposed to see this!
-I married Fred Sanford.
Chandler, you don't understand.
You know,
that doesn't fit into any category.
So you see, I'm not messy.
I'm just so organized that..
Okay, okay, fine! Now you know.
I'm sick.
No, honey, you're not sick. I don't
love you because you're organized.
I love you in spite of that.
Really?
-Promise you won't tell anyone?
can we share the closet?
Well.. It's just..
I'm afraid you might mess it up.
-Hey.
-Hey.
So Rachel's all moved out?
How you taking it?
I wanted to have a few beers..
but I got rid of those because
of orange juice with calcium.
It's a couple weeks past its expiration
date, so it's got a bit of a kick.
-Are you okay?
-You kidding me? Yeah, I'm great.
I'm better than great. I am good.
Now that she's gone, I can do stuff
I'm better off this way.
I'm a lone wolf.
A loner. Alone.
All alone. Forever.
What's a wolf gotta do
to get a hug around here?
That's it, just relax.
-Come on, more.
-Oh, God!
You like that, don't you?
-Yeah, right there.
-Yeah, say my name. Say it.
And now I'm going
to cover you back up.
And I won't be speaking with you
for several weeks.
-Oh! Hey, Rach!
-You too!
How's living at Ross'?
It's good, except he makes us watch
the Discovery Channel all day long.
Something really boring happened
to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.
Oh, thank you.
to-go cup of coffee.
I wish you would get over her.
I hate seeing you like this.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?
Thanks. Maybe later.
-Gunther, can I get a scone?
on Valentine's Day.
I want her to love me back.
And I want relief from the wrenching
pain of knowing that won't happen!
We have red bagels.
Okay.
So how do you guys
like living together so far?
-Oh, it's been good.
about crumbs than you are.
There was a drumstick in the couch.
And I am not uptight about crumbs.
It's just that, you know..
crumbs attract mice.
And mice leave droppings.
And that's how the plague started.
So you wanna relive that again..
Mice didn't start the plague.
Rats did.
Rattus norvegicus, to be exact.
Oh, good God, Ross.
Nick at Nite, once in a while.
All right, I'm going.
Bye.
Phoebe, will you wait here?
-I wanna get your opinion on something.
Rachel moving in?
I'm on my way to tell her.
She's been away all week,
but she'll be cool.
She's been so supportive.
She even got the baby a T-shirt
that says "Fossils are my friends."
Come on, Mona. Don't kiss ass.
So I'm gonna take off.
Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot!
-My friend giving birth.
Could you take it to your apartment?
"Candy and Cookie"?
Candy's the mom,
Cookie's the daughter.
The father's name is also Cookie.
Why am I friends with these people?
Phoebe, come here.
I wanna show you
something in the bathroom.
Monica, grow up.
-What's behind your back?
-Not really.
Come on, I'm your older brother.
Ask me.
Okay, big brother.
Which one would make your best friend
want to do your little sister?
The red one.
Hey.
I know you're depressed,
live, furry playmate.
I'm not sleeping
with your friend Jane again.
Hey, a dog!
Who, you gotta admit,
looks a lot like Jane.
He's the happiest dog ever.
till he cheers you up.
I borrow him myself
from time to time..
when I get depressed
thinking about..
world hunger, poverty..
Not to trivialize your pain.
Thanks so much, Pheebs.
comfortable and a bit more slutty.
"Candy and Cookie"?
"Candy and Cookie"?!
Monica got me porn?
Girl-on-girl porn?!
She really must love me!
-Yeah, just relax.
-I love you, St. Valentine.
Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty.
Now push!
Oh, God, it hurts!
Worst porn ever!
Worst porn ever!
-Oh, make it stop!
-Hi.
I accidentally packed these
with my stuff.
-Who is this?
-Phoebe's friend's dog.
I don't know his real name.
but I've gotta go to work.
I hope I stop talking like this
before my meeting. Yes, I do.
Bye-bye, Joey.
Seriously, I can't stop it.
Come here! Hey!
That's Rachel. She used to live here.
Might as well be honest with you.
You're a guy.
Well, you used to be.
So, what do you think?
I've still got it.
-Why did you get me this?
-What is it?
It's yelling, bleeding, dilating.
Oh, the dilating!
Is this the video of the birth? It's
Phoebe's. Why were you watching it?
I thought maybe you got me porn
get you porn for Valentine's Day..
you were right.
It's about a girl who moves
to the city in search of stardom..
but ends up having sex
with a lot of guys.
It got four stars.
Wait a minute. Those aren't stars.
-Anyway, you wanna take a look?
-Hey, what's going on?
Remember the first time
you saw Jaws..
how long it took
to go back in the water?
We can't let this tape
bedroom and change into her sweatpants.
-Okay, you don't know. You didn't
see it. -Childbirth is beautiful.
Oh, beautiful? Really?
You think this is beautiful?
Oh, my God!
No wonder my mother hates me!
-See, honey, there's..
-Hey!
-How was Atlantic City?
-Good.
I brought you back a present.
You didn't have to..
Saltwater taffy?!
Thanks.
Interestingly, it isn't made
with seawater.
It's actually made
-Me too. I missed you!
Me too.
-How was your week?
-Good.
-The baby started kicking.
-How exciting!
It was amazing. The only thing is,
-I was missing out on all this stuff.
-Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
-Yeah, right.
-What?
-Joey cracks me up.
"Have your ex-wife move in.
with a woman he got pregnant.
So, what'd you tell him?
You didn't tell Mona
Rachel moved in?
She seemed to think
it was such a crazy idea.
Plus, she got me taffy.
-Really? I've never had any.
suicide to provide saltwater treats.
Thank you.
Are you gonna tell her?
I will. I want to butter her up first.
I'm gonna take her to dinner,
do all this romantic stuff.
When she thinks
I'm the best boyfriend ever..
I'll tell her my pregnant
she's a lucky, lucky lady.
So where are..?
What the crap is up with this stuff?
Is it gum? Is it food?
What's the deal?
Oh, it's nice.
the perfect night.
Hey, what's the best date
you ever had?
Last year, Greg Hayman took me
to a very nice sushi dinner.
Then we took a romantic walk
and freed  monkeys.
I knew it!
I knew I wasn't crazy!
Last year, a monkey
did attack me at the bus stop!
So between her and me being friends,
with a cat.
-Hey.
-Hey.
How's my favorite dog, huh?
How's my favorite dog?
You're subdued.
-Did you give him a beer?
-Sure.
Oh, me, right.
-He's miserable. What happened to him?
-Nothing.
-We talked about stuff.
-What stuff?
Rachel stuff.
Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!
so just look happy, okay?
-I'll take him to Wendy's.
-He's fine.
Look.
Here's your ball!
Get your ball!
Get your ball!
Get..
Of course.
You don't want a tennis ball.
Not when you can have a meatball.
Come on, get the meatball.
God, what have I done to you?
I broke the dog, Pheebs!
What are you doing tonight?
Oh, I got big Valentine's plans.
I got my Chinese food on the way,
and your saltwater taffy.
Interestingly, it isn't made
with seawater..
We actually watched
I'll get my cash.
Mona?
What are..?
Hi! How are you?
I'm supposed to pick you up.
I made you a Valentine's dinner.
Surprise!
-Oh! Hey, Mona!
if anybody needs me.
What is she doing?
Lately she just likes
hanging out here.
-Why?
-I think she's lonely.
But it's Valentine's Day.
and eat this in bed.
And you thought
she was gonna be in our way!
Open the champagne,
and I will be right back.
-I've got a surprise.
-Rachel, wait.
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way.
-What are you doing?
-Do you need the phone?
No.
Ross is too nice to say it,
you go back to your place.
But, Mona, I live here.
Happy Valentine's Day!
Or, something to remember me by.
-How long has it been this time?
-Ninety seconds.
Ninety seconds is a long time
not to think about it.
Except all I did was think about it.
I know. It haunts me.
Till now, the worst thing I'd seen was
make that my screen saver.
We have to get past this.
We'll pretend it never existed.
I could do that.
Now all we gotta do
is get rid of this chair.
-Oh, thank God!
on your Valentine.
I had to get away from the yelling.
Mona's dumping Ross.
-Oh, my God.
-Poor Ross.
We watch him do yoga in his underwear,
you wanted to see?
It's here.
We should warn you before
you watch it. Don't watch it.
You saw it? Is it scary?
It's ironic how footage
of someone being born..
can make you want to kill yourself.
Honey, she may not have to watch it
Will you watch it with me?
No, but I'll leave a sweater that
smells like me right next to you.
Monica, come on.
You want to have kids.
I do.
But the stork
make me watch this alone.
She's right. Of course not.
Honey, get the tape.
This reminds me of a very specific
part of the tape.
Oh, sure. But if you leave a drumstick
under there and you're a bad roommate.
Here we go.
Okay.
Oh, my.
Come on, come on.
Why is that baby torturing that woman?
Why have I seen this thing
-I know, I know! I'm so sorry for you!
What do I do? I don't want to do this!
How do I get out of it?
-You guys! You guys, look!
-What? Did her ass explode?
No, the baby's out. Look.
Look at those little fingers and toes.
Look how happy the mom is now.
-Oh, Rach.
-Hey!
-What's up?
-Mona just dumped me.
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?
Lately, I haven't exactly been
the perfect boyfriend.
I didn't tell her
and then had the locks changed.
Then I lied to her about Rachel
moving in with me.
In a way, I judge her for not
breaking up with me sooner.
That really sucks.
What are you doing here?
Joey without a date
on Valentine's Day?
What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?
-Sort of.
-Really?
You don't have to seem
I am sure it has happened to me.
You know, actually,
once I got dumped during sex.
-So anyway, what is it?
-Forget about it. It's no big deal.
-Come on, what is it?
Why can't you tell me?
Okay. Sit down.
There's this woman that I like a lot.
But it can't happen.
She's not a Tribbiani?
No!
So is she someone from work?
Yes.
Well, does she like you?
Sometimes I think she could.
But I can't do anything about it.
Why not?
It's complicated.
She was with this other guy
for a long time.
Someone from work too.
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.
Wait, I thought you
because I'm his only friend.
Excuse me?
Sorry, sorry.
And I'm your only friend too.
So this guy she used to go out with,
is he still in love with her?
-No, I don't think so.
-I don't know.
It's worth finding out,
if you like her.
I do, so much.
I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't sleep..
You know what?
You owe it to yourself.
Here's your warm milk.
I'm gonna put the bourbon
in it at home.
Anyway, seriously,
just talk to the guy, okay?
Let me know how it goes.
It's Rachel.
You're having a baby
the whole thing. Just do it!
I came to the big city
to become a star.
-I'll do anything to make that happen.
-Anything?
Maybe it starts with
becomes the father.
No, no.
Can't get pregnant that way.
There's this woman that I like a lot.
But it's complicated.
She was with this other guy
for a long time.
I could never do that to the guy.
is he a good guy?
The best.
-Then talk to him.
-I don't know.
It's worth finding out,
if you like her.
I do, so much.
I can't stop thinking about her.
You have to go for it.
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.
It's Rachel.
I'm sorry, did you just say
it's Rachel?
Yes.
You like Rachel?
Yes. I like Rachel.
Rachel?!
Yeah. Okay, but look, you know..
You know who else I like? You.
And it doesn't get said enough.
-It's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal?
I'm sorry, I just..
What about the stuff you said?
How you can't stop thinking about her?
How you can't sleep?
I'm an actor, you know?
As a group, we tend to be
And I know it's wrong, okay?
It's not like anything's
ever gonna happen.
These are just feelings.
They'll go away.
You know, I gotta go.
Hey, Ross..
You know, I just have one...
-That's the youngest girl to reject me.
-You guys!
-Hey there.
Let me ask you.
Do you believe in soul mates?
Oh, yes, I do.
There's one person out there
Stop looking.
I've stopped looking
for Russell Crowe.
He'll find me.
And you?
No. I believe that certain people
are more suited for each other, but..
-Soul mates? I don't think they exist.
-Well, last night, I met Monica's.
What?
I had a date with this guy.
I swear he's her other half.
You don't think there's somebody
better suited for Monica than me?
Well, what's he like?
-He's tall. He has brown hair.
Oh, unknowable universe!
-He works with food.
-Oh, sure. Older?
-Obviously. And he's British.
-I was just gonna ask!
And he's so centered,
can't hear you.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Maybe I'm wrong.
We're going out again.
I'll find out more.
He's meant for her,
but a girl's gotta eat.
Rachel?!
I didn't know Joey was on JAG.
-Hey.
-Hey.
I talked to Joey.
I wanted to see you.
I still can't believe it.
only weirder.
I know you're hurting..
but don't say that again.
What if they marry?
He'd be the stepfather of my child.
You don't need to worry.
He'll never tell her how he feels.
If he did, you don't know
how she'd react.
Sure, women never like Joey.
-He's not?
All he's thinking about
is how you're taking this.
It's freaking him out.
He wants to move to Vermont.
-Why?
this must be for you..
but I don't want you
to lose Joey over it.
Right now, he needs to know
that you're still his friend.
Okay, I'll talk to him.
I'd do it soon.
He just asked me how to convert
-Hi.
-Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
-Hello.
Hello, nice to meet you.
How are you?
Soul mate.
-What are you guys doing?
-I know! Is this ?
-That's what I said! Isn't it strange?
-Not really.
What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?
On a barbecued-chicken pizza?
No?
-What restaurants do you like?
-Octavio. -and-.
-There's this place, Alessandro's.
Your food is fantastic!
I want to talk about your menu.
Anyone want coffee?
If you're talking about me,
I'll go with you.
I'll have a mocha-ccino.
What are you doing?
I swear, I didn't know you guys
who hit on my wife.
Just because I think they're soul mates
doesn't mean anything'll happen.
Phoebe? Good work.
He's great. I love him.
Don't worry, we'll find you
someone else.
I understand if you came by to hit me.
mad at you..
and that I certainly
do not hate you.
I just came here to say that.
Hey, wait, Ross?
You wanna come in
for a beer or something?
Yeah, sure.
You got any beer?
All I got is melon stuff
on this Rachel thing, okay?
I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize
my friendship with you.
Thank you.
Anyway, it'll just..
It'll take me a while to get over her.
I'm not sure how to do that.
I've never been in love, so..
What?
You're in love with her?
-Yeah. I thought you knew that.
to feel this way, honest.
I just keep thinking,
"I'll get over this," you know?
But it just keeps getting harder.
I don't know what to do, you know?
What do I do?
-You need to tell her how you feel.
-That's the green stuff talking.
I'm serious.
you can start to move on.
But what if,
and I'm not saying she will be..
If she is where you are..
then my feeling weird
shouldn't stand in the way.
-Are you sure?
she couldn't find a better guy.
Hey, thanks.
-So when are you gonna talk to her?
-Oh, my God. I have to tell her.
I haven't thought about it.
What should I say?
I'm understanding,
and focusing more on the cheese.
Cheese, you say?
That's some
pretty smelly work, huh, Don?
-Excuse me?
-Cheese. It's smelly.
You must smell a lot of the time too.
Not really. But with cheese,
I can't have blue cheese in the house.
And you're still married to him?
I would like to go to France and eat
nothing but bread and cheese.
Not even bread. Just cheese.
No, I want the bread.
And pastries.
And pate.
I'm really not high.
I just used to be fat.
I have a villa in the Loire Valley
wouldn't that be incredible?
-I'd move in tomorrow!
-Oh, come on!
-Listen to this!
-I'm so sorry.
-What do we do?
I can tell her how I feel.
Okay, stand up straight.
Take a couple deep breaths.
Look confident.
Joey? What's up?
I came by because
I want to talk to you about something.
What's up?
Here, in the hall?
What are we, animals?
I'm late for a meeting.
to prepare.
Don't you people ever knock?
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.
Wouldn't that be nice?
Sure. Set it up.
I'll just be browsing
through the personals.
Are you okay?
-Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.
I don't believe in that,
but you two get along.
I'll step aside if you wanna go with
Don and live in a house of cheese.
-You don't believe in soul mates?
-Nope.
We weren't destined
to end up together.
We fell in love and work hard
at our relationship.
Some days we work really hard.
So you don't want to live with Don
Do you know how hard it'd be to clean?
-I love you.
-I know.
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.
I found this place that makes
the greatest jalapeno poppers.
No? They taste so good.
It happens whenever Chandler
-Yeah, sure.
Look, the reason..
Is it hot in here?
Why don't you take off your sweater?
This is a nice place..
and my T-shirt has a picture
of Calvin doing Hobbes.
Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?
Yeah, sure.
I wouldn't think Hobbes
would like that so much.
How long have we known each other?
Seven, eight..
Eight years. Wow.
A long time.
But over the past few weeks, I..
Okay! Sorry about the wait,
-Sure.
Second's up!
Not that kind of table.
So you were saying?
I'm not sure.
You asked how long we knew each other,
and I said eight years.
Then the waiter came over
and cut his tip in half..
and now here we are.
Yeah. Here we are.
I think I'm falling in love with you.
What?
I'm falling in love with you.
Who are you talking to?
Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.
Funny. It's funny!
I don't get it.
Okay.
Wow.
Okay, so the specials are..
Are you..?
How did..?
When?
Does it really matter?
Wow. Wow.
It is hot in here.
I know this is a lot.
You don't have to say anything.
You take as much time as you need.
Okay, you gotta say something.
Joey, I love you so much.
-But..
-Please don't leave like this.
You can't do this to a pregnant woman!
Don't start doing that.
You can't do that,
because you're gonna make me..
Oh, there we go!
-Can I?
-Sure.
Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose..
Hey, hey.
You can't, okay? Ever.
I'm so sorry.
Please don't be sorry.
Okay? Don't be sorry.
You know, I was only kidding.
Yeah, that was a real good one.
-Is this your table?
-I know.
I haven't even read the specials.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
I think maybe one of them is dying.
I kind of hope it's the girl.
The guy is really cute!
Joey? Are you in there?
-That's Rachel.
-You have to talk to her.
I can't. Not after the other night.
-Hey, Rachel.
Is Joey here?
-I don't see him. You?
-No.
Maybe he's in the sugar bowl.
Joey? Nope.
Well, at least you make
-I haven't seen him since he said..
how he, you know..
I don't know,
I think he's avoiding me.
Why is that bagel on the floor?
-We were playing a game.
-Was Chandler naked?
Sort of like a ring-toss
-What? No! No!
All right, listen. If you see Joey,
will you just tell him that..?
Tell him I miss him.
-Okay. Did you hear that?
-Yeah. That naked bagel game?
Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty
-I can't.
You guys don't know what it's like
to get shot down.
I don't know what that's like?
Until I was , I thought the response
to "I love you" was "Oh, crap."
No rejection?
I got shot down at fat camp.
Boy, kids are mean
You're gonna never talk to her again?
It's weird and it's awkward,
but you gotta at least try.
Yeah, okay.
I forgot this was on your..
We didn't play it!
I'll look at your tea leaves
and tell your fortune.
-You read tea leaves?
because I was so accurate.
And one of the great joys
of life..
is its wondrous unpredictability,
you know?
And also,
-Okay.
I see a ladder.
Which can mean either a promotion
or a violent death.
I'm the head chef.
I can't get promoted.
Who's next?
I'm done. Do mine.
Okay.
Oh! Okay, I see a circle.
Which can either mean
a scientific discovery!
Well, I have been spending
a lot of time in the lab.
-What does yours say, Pheebs?
-All right.
Wow! Yay!
Oh, I'm gonna meet a guy!
I had a dream about last night.
Has anyone seen my shirt?
It's a button-down, like
a faded salmon color?
You mean your pink shirt?
Faded salmon color?
No, I haven't seen your pink shirt.
I must have left it at Mona's.
I knew it!
I'm sure you can get another one
I love it.
Ask Mona to give it back.
I don't know. I could.
We didn't really end things
on good terms.
If I went, I'd be ignoring the
one thing she asked me to do..
jump up my own ass and die.
Oh, wait a second, you guys?
I've been seeing that guy
go to the same bookstore.
Maybe he's the tea guy.
Did you see that?
He totally checked you out!
And he is so cute!
Mine is a picture of the Village
People. What does that mean?
Hi.
Hey.
-Hi.
would be okay..
but we don't know
how to be together.
By the way,
I've been meaning to say this.
If you guys knew about this,
Be prepared."
-Sorry.
-Well, for next time.
-It's tough, but things will improve.
-How do you know?
What if it gets worse and worse..
to the point where we
in a sarcastic comment?
Some cheese?
Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CD
in the Cat Stevens case?
If I can't find the right case,
I use the nearest one.
-Where is the Cat Stevens CD?
-I'll save you time.
Two hundred CDs,
not one of them in the right case.
Okay. No need to panic.
Deep breaths, everyone.
We'll just have to put the CDs
come up with some kind of order.
We have to talk this through.
Oh, my God, you have such
problems! I feel so terrible for you!
All right. Okay, I'm sorry.
You're both focusing on
this uncomfortable thing.
Change the subject.
Get him talking about something else.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Maybe you need his advice
-Good.
The Miami Vice soundtrack?
Really?
They were just giving those away
at the store.
In exchange for money.
Hey.
I really don't know what to tell you.
Maybe Joey could help you out
-Yeah, Joey, she's..
Rachel's got this big work problem.
It is a head-scratcher.
Know what? If we're gonna make dinner,
we're gonna have to leave.
Yeah, Joey, maybe
-Oh, and you know what?
While you're helping
solve this problem..
you might want to do something with
your hands. Like, off the top of my head..
maybe put the CDs
It's something. It's..
It's my boss.
-Yeah?
-Yeah. And, uh..
And my baby.
Yeah?
My boss wants to buy my baby.
What? Oh, my God!
I know, I told you,
it's a really big problem!
-He wants to buy your baby?
-That's what I told him!
-How did this even happen?
-Well, I'll tell you.
See, my boss and his wife,
they can't have children, so..
And then when we were
"Rachel, I want to buy your baby."
When you said it was a problem
about your boss and the baby..
I figured it was
about maternity leave.
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, that would have been
-Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere.
I'm Jim. Jim Nelson.
Hi, Jim-Jim Nelson.
I'm Phoebe-Phoebe Buffay.
-We've seen each other a lot lately.
-Yes.
Maybe we'll see each other at
where would I be?
Upstream.
Damn, nobody's here
for my good ones.
I am so sorry I spilled wine
all over your shirt.
-It's okay.
I have something you could wear.
Here.
I don't know if I want to wear
a woman's shirt.
-That's a man's shirt.
-Awfully pink.
It's not pink!
Honey, we are so meant
-Honey, both yours.
Hey, great advice on that Joey thing.
-The work problem?
-It was perfect.
It felt like he was my friend.
-What problem did you say you have?
-Oh, that's not important.
The point is,
my friend's baby?
Isn't it funny how we kept meeting?
It's as if someone wants us together.
Someone does. Me.
Witty banter. Well done. Good.
-Tell me a little bit about yourself.
-Okay. I'm a masseuse.
-And I used to work at this place..
-Ain't no thing. I'm wild too.
So anyway..
I've lived in New York,
somewhat wildly, I guess..
for, well, since I was .
I'm sorry. I'm staring.
It's just that you have
the most beautiful eyes.
-Oh, stop it.
a little strong.
I'll give you the benefit
of the doubt.
The universe wants us
to be together.
Why don't we start over?
-Okay.
I write erotic novels..
for children.
-What?
-They're wildly unpopular.
Oh, my God!
Also, you might like to know
I have a Ph.D.
-Wow! You do?
-Joey, honey, listen.
Thanks for talking to me yesterday.
It meant a lot.
Not a problem.
Just so you know..
that guy won't be bothering
-Let's just say I took care of it.
Let's say more.
Don't worry. I told him, very nicely
"You don't go buying people's babies!
So back off!"
-What?
-What?
No, no, no!
He doesn't want to buy my baby!
to talk about!
And you couldn't think
of anything else?
You said your boss
wants to buy your baby?
You yelled at my boss!
my boss into it! I'll be fired!
-You lied to me!
-Well, she told me to!
Chandler has two copies of Annie!
Oh, my God!
-Ross!
-Hello!
What are you doing?
Not touching myself, if that makes
-It's best I speak first.
Yeah.
Lee from Human Resources is here
as a witness to our conversation.
Oh, God.
If I in any way implied
that I wanted to buy your baby..
I am sorry. Okay?
Last week, when I asked you
I felt that I was "due" your baby.
I want to be very clear..
that I understand
that it's your baby..
and it is not mine to purchase.
Well, as long as we are clear
about that.
There it is.
-Not your regular cleaners.
I had to find a new one.
I have to find a new bank,
adult bookstore, grocery store..
-What?
-A new grocery store.
The universe said I'd meet a nice guy.
I'm gonna kick some ass.
You'll meet someone. If I can meet
a great guy, so can you.
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
-You didn't have to come in.
-You kidding?
This is where they get out stains.
the dance of the clean shirts.
Excuse me.
I think you dropped..
-Wow!
-What?
Sorry.
But what are you gonna do?
Don't think I'm crazy,
but I was meant to pick this up.
-Do you believe in that kind of thing?
-A little.
Now you're talking.
-Want to go for coffee?
Can I watch how you get this out?
She must have left.
-So? What happened?
-It's all gonna be okay.
They're so happy I'm not suing, I got
an extra month paid maternity leave.
So long as I understand the money
or any other child.
Ralph Lauren is going
out of their way..
to show they're not
in the baby-buying business.
-Give us a minute?
I was just trying to make things..
I know. I know.
It kind of worked.
I don't know about you,
but I haven't thought about our thing.
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah. It's kind of been
like "us" again, a little bit.
-Yeah, I know. I've missed that.
how I put myself out there..
and said that stuff.
How you didn't feel the same..
and how it was really awkward.
My gynecologist tried to kill me.
Item J-A.
Hi, listen.
Come here. Come..
I'm so, so sorry about yesterday.
But what did I tell you about leaving
and not someone else.
I guess lucky is too strong a word.
Anyway, Mona, I'm really, really sorry.
It's just..
Listen, you don't have to apologize.
I understand why you were there.
-You do?
I still have feelings for you.
I wish we could work it out,
but we can't.
It's too complicated with you
and Rachel and the baby. I just..
It just wasn't meant to be.
Oh, God. You're right.
Ross, we have to be strong.
Okay, I'm gonna go.
Can I? To remember you?
No.
Is it okay if I bring someone
-Yeah.
-Who's the guy?
-Parker, we met at the cleaners.
Did he put a little starch
in your bloomers?
Who said that?
No, he's really great, though.
when he treats me like a naughty girl.
Would it be okay if I give the toast?
Even after what happened
at their th?
-I'd really like to.
-Hopefully this time Mom won't boo you.
Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast,
-You wonder why Ross is their favorite?
Any time Ross makes a toast, everyone
cries and pats him on the back.
And they all come up to me and say,
"God, your brother."
You know what they're gonna say
person will be crying.
I'm an actor, and any actor
worth his salt can cry on cue.
-Really? You can do that?
-Oh, you kidding me? Watch.
Well, I can't do it
You look so fantastic.
On my way over,
I pictured you in my mind's eye.
Now I'm like,
"Mind's eye, you had no idea!"
-Let's do that again!
-I'm working on my toast.
Or as I like to call it
"Sob-fest ."
I cannot wait to see them cry.
It's not gonna be like regular crying. It's
gonna be like Terms of Endearment crying.
I'm gonna reduce my parents
from my childhood.
-Hey, check this out.
-It's a dog.
It's a dead dog.
Chi-Chi. She died
when I was in high school.
-You're talking about a dead pet?
for my parents?
In honor of their th anniversary,
I had a star named after them.
-That is so cool.
-And I got Kama Sutra for the Elderly.
You know, I think maybe
-Sure.
What do you need? We got lace,
satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt..
And I think my testicles
may be in here too.
Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog.
Monica couldn't get braces
-You're the -pounder who rode her!
Hey! Everybody, this is Parker.
Parker, this is..
Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel..
and I'm sorry,
Already you're my favorite.
-Tell me a little about yourselves.
-Actually, we should get going.
Classic Ross!
Rachel, look how you glow! May I?
I think you already are.
Rachel, you have life
growing inside you.
Is there anything more miraculous..
He passed away years ago.
Well, at least you were lucky to have
him. Bow-wow, old friend. Bow-wow.
You guys, we really should get going.
There I go again, my catch phrase.
-So where's the party?
-It's in Massapequa.
Massapequa, it sounds magical. Is it
in the shape of a tepee.
I've got my notes.
You got the presents?
-I've got the car keys.
-We're driving? Aces.
-So he seems like a nice guy.
-Okay, otherwise I'm not going.
-Hey, Mom.
-This is such a great party!
Thirty-five years. Impressive.
Do you have any pearls of wisdom?
-Jack?
It's a good question.
-Congratulations, you two.
-Thank you, we're so excited.
And also, congratulations
on your wedding.
-Can we talk to you for just a moment?
having this baby out of wedlock..
our friends are less open-minded.
-We told them you're married.
-What?
Thanks for going along with this.
-We have to pretend that we're married?
-I had to shave my ears.
You can do this.
-Can you believe that?
take a pass at the nose.
I don't want to have to lie
about being married.
I don't either. But it's their party,
and it's one night.
We don't have to lie.
we'll smile, we'll nod along..
-Ross?
-Rachel?
Hi, Aunt Lisa. Uncle Dan.
Congratulations on the baby
and on the wedding.
-Here's something to start you out.
-We love marriage.
We'll see you later.
-Hey!
-Hi!
Can I just say, Monica,
that your driving is exquisite.
Thanks. Like I said before,
What a great night.
I have to tell you, being here
with all of you in Event Room C..
I feel so lucky. Think of the good
times that happened here.
The birthdays, the proms,
I don't want to forget it.
It's like I want to take a mental
picture of you all. Click.
I don't think the flash went off.
-I'm gonna find the men's room.
-I'll go with you.
Somewhere there is someone
for that man.
I have to go too, but I don't
want him complimenting my thing.
Glad we weren't in the car.
Did he let up?
He called the Long Island
I must take a mental picture!
Sorry.
Were you guys making fun of Parker?
That depends, how much did you hear?
He's a little enthusiastic.
What's wrong with that?
-It's so much.
-Well, so what? I like him.
Do I make fun of the people you date?
Do you want my opinion?
Your collective dating record reads
like a who's who of human crap!
-I feel terrible.
-I know.
What was wrong with Mona?
-Open it, open it, open it.
about your wedding.
-We were surprised we weren't invited.
-No, it was a small wedding.
But it was beautiful.
It was small, but kind of spectacular.
-Where did you have it?
Lovely" as I walked down the aisle.
-Stevie's a family friend.
-Oh, my God. That's amazing.
-I'd love to see pictures.
-Yeah, so would I.
You wouldn't think Annie Liebowitz
-What? This may be my only wedding.
-And I want it to be amazing.
-Okay.
-Maybe I rode in on a Harley.
-Ross, it has to be realistic.
Say, are you okay?
-And I'm with you. What a great time!
Look at this plate bouncy thing.
What an inspired solution to man's
plate-dispensing problems.
Oysters! Let me feed you.
That's not necessary.
-Please?
-Okay, fine.
-Good.
-What're they like? I've never had one.
-Try one.
-They look too weird.
I know, I know.
Listen, your family is really
-Going over my toast.
I can't wait. They'll cry so hard,
they'll be fighting for breath.
If you want to, I could just
hold them down and you could just..
And my veil was lace,
-Not at first, but it's intricate work.
They said even though they lost
their sight, it was worth it.
-I bet you looked beautiful.
-Well, I don't know.
But there were some people that said
-Oh, yeah, that's a great story.
Well, actually, I took her
to the planetarium.
That's where we had our first date.
I had the room filled with lilies,
her favorite flower.
-That is so sweet!
"The Way You Look Tonight" came on..
the lights came down,
I got on one knee..
and written across the dome,
in the stars, were the words:
"Will you marry me?"
And the ring was the size of my fist.
Hey, Phoebe? Look..
I want to apologize. Okay?
-You better do it now.
-Why?
-Because I'm gonna kill him.
-What?
-He's too excited about everything.
I'm all for living, but this is
This party stinks.
I'm having the worst time.
There was a line for the buffet,
and when I got to the plates..
I slipped on a giant booger.
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
It could've been.
I didn't look at it.
I wiped it on Chandler's coat
I was so excited about him.
Well, hey, you should
be excited about him.
There's nothing wrong with him.
-You think?
-Yeah, know what?
-We were all just being too negative.
all stand to be more like Parker.
You know what? I'm like him!
I'm a positive person!
-Actually, you have an edge.
-What's that?
-Oh, it's Parker!
-You do?
Are you kidding? People acting
like animals to music? Come on!
Okay, it's time for the toast.
I know normally Ross gives the toast,
but this year I'll do it.
No, it's gonna be great. Really.
Okay.
Mom, Dad, when I got married..
the thing that made me sure I could
I want to thank you.
I know I probably don't
say it enough..
but I love you.
When I look around, I'm saddened by the
thought of those who could not be here.
Nana, my beloved grandmother,
pass this to my parents.
Remember she's dead, okay?
Her and Nana, gone.
Wow!
Does anybody remember when..
Debra Winger had to say goodbye to
her children in Terms of Endearment?
Didn't see that?
No movie fans?!
You want to hear something sad?
I was watching a  Minutes
that they were incapable of love.
You people are made of stone!
Here's to Mom and Dad. Whatever!
Thank you, Monica.
That was interesting.
-Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
-Why don't I remember this dog?
Ross? Why don't you give us
It's just Monica this year.
You're not saying anything?
On our th wedding anniversary?
No, of course.
Everybody? I just wanted to say..
on behalf of my new bride, Rachel..
and myself, that if..
if in  years, we're half
as happy as you guys are..
we'll count ourselves
to hear Ross' toast.
My God, what a fantastically
well-lit hallway.
Can I get you something to drink,
like a water and Valium?
I must say, this apartment,
-It's a haven.
-A third-floor paradise, a modern Eden.
-Yeah, I know, I know. Gotcha.
Listen, why don't we just sit and
relax, just be with each other quietly.
That sounds great.
This is the most comfortable couch
Let's play a game.
-I love games.
-Shocking.
Let's play the game of..
who can stay quiet the longest.
Or Jenga.
Let's play this one first, and
remember, whoever talks first loses.
-I lose, now Jenga.
-You know the word "wrong"?
Everything isn't perfect or magical?
Everything isn't aglow
with the light of fairies?
They were just brake lights, Parker!
Excuse me for putting a good spin
on a traffic jam.
You don't have to put
-No, I'm a positive person.
You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.
At Disneyland, getting laid!
You want me to be negative?
You want me to be less happy?
Much less happy.
Fine. Well, then to quote Ross,
"I better be going."
So long!
Don't let the "best door in the world"
you've had in your life?
We could've gone from the ceremony to
the reception with you in the sidecar.
It just isn't feasible.
But a dove placing the ring on your
finger would've been no problem.
-It was fun being married to you.
-Yeah.
-That proposal at the planetarium?
-I know, I know. It was stupid.
Are you kidding? With the lilies,
and the song and the stars?
It was really wonderful.
when we were going out.
That's how I imagined
I would ask you to marry me.
Wow.
Well, that would've been
very hard to say no to.
It's a good thing I didn't do it, it
-Good night.
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen
to protect your hair?
-I will think about it.
-That's all I'm asking.
Okay, that's it. I give up.
At Mom and Dad's th anniversary,
why they didn't cry.
-Come on.
-That stuff you said about true love?
You were right. We did learn
a lot from Mom and Dad.
That picture of Chi-Chi
she really would've wanted to be there.
And you know what?
I think she was.
Oh, good God, Ross,
how the hell do you do it?
Hi. So I'm doing the Soap Opera
Digest crossword puzzle...
...and guess who is the clue
blank Tribbiani."
That's me! I'm blank!
How cool! We know three down.
I'm touching three down.
Yeah, you are, baby.
Three down knows I'm married.
What's three down doing?
Do they call to tell you you're in it?
No. They wanted to do
the writers got mad...
...and I fell down an elevator shaft.
Who knows what I'd say now?
If only there was something
in your head to control what you say.
Come on, you'll keep it
You deserve that.
In the interview, you could mention,
I don't know, "gal pal Rachel Green."
Is that "gal pal" spelled L-O-S-E-R?
- Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
- Fine, all right, I'll do it.
You have to be there to stop me
Because we have jobs, you know?
We'll be there the whole time.
Gal pal, Rachel Green.
I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest!
And not just in the dumb crossword.
Seriously, proud of you.
The One With Joeys Interview
- Thanks for taking the time for this.
neck problems, who talk like this.
It's great that we met here.
When people hear the magazine's paying,
they want a big, fancy restaurant.
Actually, I didn't know
the magazine was paying.
Wouldn't have mattered. I do this
- Coffee.
And I'll have all the muffins.
- Hey.
- We're not talking.
Oh, finally.
According to your bio,
you've done quite a bit of work.
Anything that you're
You want a glass of milk...
...but these darn cartons
are so hard to open!
Boy, you said it, Mike.
- There's gotta be a better way!
- There is, Kevin!
This is the first time
- It is easy.
Now I can have milk every day.
So this is it, Victor?
Yeah, I guess it is. And so...
...I'm gonna get on this spaceship...
...and I'm gonna go to Blargon 
in search of alternative fuels.
But when I return  years from now,
you'll be long gone.
But I won't have aged at all.
So you tell your great-great-
I'm coming to fix the copier.
I can't get to the copier.
I'm thinking, "What do I do?"
So I just watch them have sex.
And then I say... Wait, here's my line
You know, that's bad
- Wait, you see me again.
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.
There I am. There I am. There I am.
There are so many things,
it's hard to pick just one.
I'm getting coffee. Want anything?
- A blueberry muffin and chamomile tea.
- Double latte.
- A bagel with only...
What do you do in your spare time?
Look at this clown. He thinks
he can take up the whole river.
Get out of the way, jackass!
Who names their boat
Coast Guard, anyway?
That is the Coast Guard.
What are they doing out here?
for almost four minutes.
Dude, are you trying to kill me?
Well, I see you've had
a very productive day.
- Isn't the cowboy hat a little much?
- Come on, it's fun!
All right.
Isn't this a woman's hat?
Dude, stop talking crazy
- One.
- Two, three.
- Three.
That's kind of nice.
- It's kind of a relief.
- Yeah.
- You wanna see if we still have it?
- You know, a mento. A role model.
- A mento?
- Right.
- Like the candy?
- As a matter of fact, I do.
Our readers always want to know how
and get lots of exercise.
You know we've thrown this
without dropping it for an hour?
Are you serious?
I realized it a half-hour ago,
but I didn't want to jinx it.
- Wow, we are pretty good at this.
I've ever missed a meal.
My pants are a little loose.
What's wrong with you?
I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights.
And then I passed out.
I haven't been able to stand up since.
But I don't think it's serious.
Sounds like a hernia.
thing sticking out of my stomach!
Why'd I have to start
working out again?
Damn you, fifteens!
- What is it?
- A trifle. It has layers.
A layer of ladyfingers,
which I made from scratch.
Raspberries, more ladyfingers,
beef sautéed with peas and onions.
Then a little bit more custard.
It tastes like feet.
I like it.
- Are you kidding?
- What's not to like? Custard, good.
Jam, good. Meat, good!
Well, you don't look good, Joe.
Well, the fridge broke,
- Not anymore.
This piece doesn't have floor on it.
- Stick to your side.
- Hey, come on, now.
All right, what are we having?
I don't believe in these crazy diets.
Just everything in moderation.
Your muffins.
I'll take those to go.
For the kids.
I know what I wanted to ask.
They killed you off years ago.
I shouldn't have said.
- But that is not gonna happen today.
- Understood.
- So, what'd you say back then?
- I said that I...
- Hey, Joey!
Shelly, these are my friends.
Hi, I'm gal pal Rachel Green.
If you want the dirt, come to me.
This might be Joey's baby, who knows?
I'm just kidding.
Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.
Who just lost the respect
- So far, nothing stupid.
- Mento?
- No, thanks.
As Joey's friends, is there anything
our readers should know?
No, just that he is a great guy.
That'll get you
the days of our lives.
I think that you don't expect
someone so hot to be so sweet.
- I like that. What's your name?
- Phoebe Buffay.
- How do you spell that?
And E as in, "'ello there, mate!"
Great. It was nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you too.
- Thanks.
It seems you have a lot of friends.
Who is your best friend?
How come you have two?
Well, this one's for you.
- Get out!
This isn't just about jewelry.
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're best buds.
Is this friendship? I think so!
Check it out! We're bracelet buddies!
That's what they'll call us!
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.
That's gonna leave a stain.
Rach, hey, it's fine.
- Yeah, look.
- I've never lived like this before.
- I know!
Well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food. Jeez!
I feel guilty.
So shut up and close your eyes.
You are a good friend.
The audition was this morning,
and I didn't get it.
But that was a hell of a kiss.
Rachel is a very lucky girl.
Let's get the contestants
Judge!
Judge rules No violation.
- The duck gets the Nutter Butter!
- No! That's just an old won ton.
Tough call.
- I saw it on the Discovery Channel.
- Wait a minute. I saw that!
Yeah, about jellyfish,
but I couldn't bend that way.
So...
That's right, I stepped up!
She's my friend and she needed help!
If I had to,
I'd pee on any one of you!
Nope. No best friend.
Just a lot of close friends.
So now back to the show.
How does it feel
to have a huge gay fan base?
Really? Me?
Wow, I don't even know
to my man's bag?
At first, it just looked good,
but it's practical.
Your wallet, your keys.
Your makeup.
Should I climb down your front
so we're butt to face?
- I think face is best.
- Yeah, face.
- Okay, here I come.
- All right.
Oh, my...
carrying a little holiday weight.
When we said "face to face," we didn't
think it all the way through!
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.
Check it out.
How much of a man am I?
Nice. Manly and also kind of a slut.
You're turning into a woman.
No, I'm not! Why would you say that?
it's just the way you said it.
Oh, my God! I'm a woman!
- Great nap.
- It really was.
Me? Gay? No. No. No.
But I have a number
of close friends who are.
So let's talk about women.
I'm sure our female readers are
up and down and I say
"Hey. How you doing?"
Oh, please.
Hey. How you doing?
Hey. How you doing?
He has an amazing Porsche under there.
I'd love to show you, but I just
tucked her in. She's sleeping.
Would you two girls
like to go for a drink?
- Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
- Oh, hi!
- Oh, my God! Introduce us!
- Well, this is Chandler.
You know Monica and Ross.
That's Phoebe. That's Joey.
- Hey, how you doing?
to be your roommate and friend.
I'm just... You know, I just
don't feel that way about you.
I see what happened.
It's because I was trying
to repel you. Right?
Believe me, you'd feel
- Oh, I do.
How you doing?
I'm okay.
What? Oh, dear God!
Not much to tell there.
I'm really shy.
So that's it.
I guess that's all I need.
Thank you so much.
- Bye-bye.
- I did it.
- Amazing.
Wait, I almost forgot.
We have to ask everybody this:
Other than Days,
Excuse me? I have a life, you know?
The readers at Soap Opera Digest
will be happy to learn that.
Good enough.
So close.
They didn't put in the part
about you not watching soaps.
I called the lady and said I
- A little bit.
This picture of you is steamy.
That's just a little something
for my huge gay fan base.
- Did you just wink at me?
- You're the one who loves the picture.
-Hi!
-Hey!
So, what's the final head count
from work had something else to do.
Your sisters called and can't make it.
What? You mean they're not coming
to a social event..
where there's no men and no booze?
That's shocking.
I don't care, as long as my mom's here.
-Oh, my God. Your mother.
it would be a big coincidence if she was.
My God!
Phoebe was in charge
of the invitations.
I don't have a mother.
So often I forget..
Oh, give it a rest.
So my mother is not coming
You go home and get ready.
Make sure she comes.
It's important. It's my mom.
-I know. What's her number?
-I don't know.
Go. I have it in my book. Go.
If you're in charge of invitations,
Hi, it's Monica Geller.
-Oh, hello, Monica.
-Hi.
It's last-minute, but we've decided
to throw an impromptu..
-baby shower for Rachel today.
invitations a month ago.
-Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-For what, dear?
For not inviting me,
or for lying about it?
Oh, my God! My ass is sweating.
I'm sorry for everything.
in a baby shower.
You know, things get
overlooked and..
Phoebe's mother killed herself.
Why? Did you forget
to invite her too?
Oh, you're so funny.
Please, please, can you come?
-Thank you.
-Isn't it at ?
-Son of a bitch!
Hey, Joe! Wanna shoot some hoops?
And for the record, I am not
covering the tall one this time.
Fine, but she's not that tall.
I can't go. I'm practicing. I got an audition
-Great!
If I get it, by day
I'll be Dr. Drake Ramoray.
But by night I'll be Joey Tribbiani!
You'll be perfect for this!
That's already your name!
I know. I know.
It'd be great if I got this because you
a game-show host forever.
Like that Bob Barker guy. He's been
doing The Price is Right for  years.
I bet the ratings weren't good
for the first .
You know, before there was television.
But the problem,
about Hungry Hungry Hippos.
And last week, you beat Ben.
Yeah. I have to be
honest with you guys.
He kind of let me win.
The audition's in a couple hours,
and I don't understand the game.
Do you want some help?
Oh, really? That'd be great.
some other time.
All right. Let's play Bamboozled!
-Bamboozled?
-Yeah. Isn't that a cool name?
-Yeah!
-No!
All right. Okay.
I live in New York.
I have a son, Ben. Hi, Ben! And..
I said, a little bit, Ross.
How about you, Chandler?
I'm a headhunter. I hook up
out-of-work Soviet scientists..
with rogue Third World nations.
Chandler, you'll go first.
-What is the capital of Colombia?
-Bogota.
It's Bogota, but close enough.
You can either pass your turn to Ross
or pick a Wicked Wango Card.
-What does a Wicked Wango Card do?
determines if you go higher or lower.
Higher or lower than what?
-This is embarrassing!
-Can you believe how lame this is?
I'm sorry. I don't believe contestants
are allowed to talk to each other.
I told the stripper to be here at .
That is inappropriate.
Why? He's gonna be dressed as a baby.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Green.
I'm so glad you could make it.
Thank you so much. We're so sorry.
We could not feel worse about it.
Try.
There's my little girl!
-She's still mad.
person to make small talk with.
Hey, how are you?
Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too.
It doesn't bother you?
We've apologized twice.
I can't do any more than that.
You hate it when people
to be okay with it.
Okay. I can do that.
-I gotta go powder my ass.
-Oh.
Look at that face! Just like when
you were in high school.
If I didn't know better, I'd say
-Okay.
Oh, my! Look at that.
Only three weeks to go.
Did you pick a nanny? If you use your
housekeeper, it will split her focus.
Actually, I'm not gonna use a nanny.
know how overwhelming it will be.
When you were a baby, I had Mrs. K.
Mrs. K! Oh, yeah, she was sweet.
She taught me Spanish.
I actually think
I remember some of it.
Tu madre esta loca.
Such a sweet woman.
And more important,
What did that K stand for?
I have no idea, dear.
She was the nanny.
As great as she was,
I can't afford that.
I'm sorry. Sometimes I forget
-What?
I just had a great idea!
I'm gonna come live with you!
What? What?
Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna
do this for my little girl.
Look at you.
or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
The Wheel has not been
my friend tonight, Joey.
I'll take another question.
Okay. This is gonna be tough.
Hold your breath.
It's okay. I'm ready.
You gotta hold your breath
you suffer from this phobia? Triska..
Holy cow. That's a big word. Trisk..
Look at this. How do you say that?
-Let me see that.
-This one right here.
-Triskaidekaphobia.
-Fear of Triscuits!
-No! No. Fear of the number .
They have really sharp edges.
Chandler, you're up.
I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass
for a free turn.
Yes, yes. But you can only use
it once, so choose wisely.
This is tricky.
I mean, I am in the lead, but I would
-You're upset because you're losing.
Oh, come on, Ross.
I think we're all losers here.
I would like to hang
on to my Angel Pass please.
You can either spin the Wheel
Oh, I don't care.
You must choose.
-Either. It makes no difference.
-Choose, you jackass.
-I'll take a card.
-You picked the Gimme Card!
-You get all of Ross' points!
you get my points..?
The contestants aren't supposed
to speak to each other.
Now, do you wanna start
opening presents..
because it seems like people
I mean me.
-Why did you invite my mother?
-What?
She wants to move in with me and Ross
to help take care of the baby.
-For how long?
a long lunch with her is taxing.
I'd be honored if she wanted
to live with me.
She can't hear you.
What am I gonna do?
If you don't want her to move
in with you, just tell her.
You're right.
her sleeping on my couch.
She'll wanna sleep in my bed.
This can't happen.
That is right.
Tell her you don't want her
to live with you.
Do not take no for an answer.
This is great! Now she's
be like the daughter she never had.
Oh, honey, you have
to let it go.
Okay.
Who doesn't accept an apology?
I mean, it's just so simple.
"I'm sorry, Sandra."
"That's okay, Monica.
I forgive you.
And by the way, you're very pretty."
I have new respect for Chandler.
All right, everybody!
that Rachel opens..
should be from the grandmother.
Because you're the most important
person in this room! And in the world!
I don't have a gift because I wasn't
invited until the last minute.
But thank you so much, dear, for
Let's open your presents!
-It's okay that you didn't get a gift.
-I kind of did.
Me! Eight weeks of me.
Okay. See, Mom,
the truth is, I can do this on my own.
I know you're gonna be a terrific mom.
But you need help at the beginning.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm not gonna vacuum up my baby!
Okay, come on, Rach.
It's present time!
You're the glue holding
this party together.
It's kind of falling apart here.
-Oh, look!
Oh, I know what this is.
Wait a minute.
That can't be right.
Is that a beer bong for a baby?
Darling, that's a breast pump.
Did I say I was done guessing?
Okay, thank you for that.
Oh, wow! What's this?
-It's a Diaper Genie.
-It dispenses clean diapers!
It's where you put dirty ones.
Why don't you take it outside
-What, it goes  times a day?
Are we feeding this baby Indian food?
No, dear. That's what babies do.
Rachel, listen to your mother.
She is very smart.
What will you do with the baby
while you trot out to the garbage?
I don't know,
-You can't leave a baby alone.
Of course, I know that!
Of course you never leave
a baby alone.
It would..
She wouldn't be safe.
Not as safe as she would be
overwhelming right now.
I'm gonna maybe open
them all a little bit later.
Thank you for coming,
for the gifts..
-and this basket is beautiful.
"We don't need no stinking badges!"
-Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
-Correct! Backwards Bonus.
-Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
-Yes!
What? There's extra points for that?
Fair not that's!
I'd like to go up the Ladder of Chance
-Six!
-That noise can only mean one thing.
-Hungry Monkey!
-I'd like a Wicked Wango Card.
-It's an audio question.
Name this television theme song:
Oh, my God. I know this.
-Shut up!
-"I Dream of Jeannie"!
-Yes! Back in the lead!
I'd like to spin the Wheel.
Oh, come on!
Super Speedy Speed Round.
-Is there a Hopping Bonus?
-Of course.
-Who invented bifocals?
Great Britain the longest?
Queen Victoria!
You forgot to switch legs between
questions. No Hopping Bonus!
Every time!
-Yeah. Now over to Chandler.
-I'd like a Google Card.
-Are you sure?
Because, Chandler..
-you've been Bamboozled!
-No!
-Yes!
-This is the best game ever!
You'll stay as long as I need you?
-Of course.
and giving birth.
I didn't think to read about what
to do when the baby comes.
And the baby's coming..
and I don't know what to do.
Oh, can I throw up in my Diaper Genie?
Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.
-Where you going?
Everything's gonna be okay.
It is gonna be okay!
Worth a shot.
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
I just Bamboozled Chandler!
Which is not a sexual thing.
-Well, that was a quick shower.
-Not if you were here.
Looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
We did. My mom got
us the greatest gift of all.
A Play-Doh Barbershop?
No. She's going to live
take care of the baby!
You're not serious!
She's a very nice woman,
but we can't take eight weeks of her.
-She'll drive us crazy..
-Hi, Ross!
Hey, roomie!
Hey, I'm Ray.
They're gonna help with the audition.
-Right, Ray.
-Whenever you're ready.
Hello. I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Let's play Bamboozled!
Erin, first question. In hockey,
-Correct!
Want to pick a Wicked Wango Card
or spin the Wheel?
Didn't your agents give
you the revised rules?
We've eliminated all that.
People didn't follow it.
Complicated?! Spin the Wheel
to go up the Ladder of Chance..
through the Rainbow Ring
to the Golden Monkey.
You yank his tail,
question-and-answer game now.
Well, what's fun about that?
You expect me to host a boring game
of people answering questions?
Women in bikinis hold up the scores.
Let's play Bamboozled!
So I thought we'd put the
changing station in the living room.
I thought I'd bring in my decorator
knickknacks you have..
they might be more at home
in the garage.
-Well, we don't have a garage.
-Did I say garage? I meant garbage.
You know what? Maybe it's not
-I really do. I don't know anything.
I'm sure that's not true.
Oh, no?
Do I know anything about babies?
-No. Not a thing.
-It's frightening.
Even if she doesn't
Rachel's father told me.
Know what he said
at the first  a.m. feeding?
"I'm tired. You take care of it."
Which I later said to him
when he wanted to have sex.
Well, I'm not Rachel's dad.
And no offense,
and I didn't live together.
When he was with me, I took
care of him all the time, by myself.
-That's true. You do have another child.
-Yeah.
With another woman.
Have you no control, Ross?
That's a different issue.
The point is, when the baby comes,
-Yes!
Yes. You're gonna be so missed.
-You'll be a great father.
-You'll be a wonderful grandma.
Hello? I still don't know
what the hell I'm doing!
Every first-time mother
Look, when you first came to the city..
you were a spoiled, helpless little
girl who used Daddy's credit cards!
I hope you're going
somewhere with this.
Look at you.
than you give yourself credit for.
I have no doubt you're gonna
be an incredible mother.
-Really?
-I'm telling you.
Thank you.
All right. I'm gonna get going.
No, sweetheart, stay put.
I'll let myself out. It's like I'm
What do I do?
Nothing. You have apologized
to her, like, a million times.
And she's been nothing
but terrible to you.
You just threw her daughter a lovely,
-You know what? You're right.
If you wanna say anything,
I'd tell her off.
Really?
Okay, I will.
Mrs. Green?
Mrs. Green?
It is rude to leave a party without saying
goodbye to the host.
When someone apologizes to you,
is plain spiteful.
-Spiteful?
-That's right.
It's time you took a good
look in the mirror, young lady!
Old lady!
Lady!
Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.
So whenever you're ready to apologize
I'm so proud of you.
-Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
-You should be.
-Could you get me something to drink?
-You got it!
Mrs. Green? Okay, I'm really sorry!
-You sure?
I've done my studying,
and I know my stuff.
All right, then.
Rachel Green,
let's play Bamboozled!
How do you test the temperature
-Excellent!
-How do you put a baby down for a nap?
-Full, dry, on its back, no loose covers.
Correct!
There's a hopping bonus here,
but I don't suggest you take it.
Okay.
This is an audio question. What do
question or a Wicked Wango Card?
-A card! A card! I pick a card!
-Oh, I'm sorry.
You've been Bamboozled!
You're gonna be a terrible mother!
I've lost sight of why we're doing this!
Please don't walk away.
I've gone too far.
-Hey. I got some bad news.
Try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
No. Monica's restaurant got a horrible
review in the Post.
I didn't want her to see it, so I ran
around and bought all the copies.
Two, four, six, one million.
And I've had bad reviews.
I remember my first good one
"Everything else in Our Town
was terrible.
Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
Oh, my God!
Look at all the newspapers.
It must be a good review. Is it great?
Oh, dear God.
But the good news is, no one
-They all know.
Oh, my God, this is horrible.
I'm so humiliated.
They say there's no such thing
as bad press.
You don't think that "the mahi-mahi
-Oh, no!
Monica, listen to me.
I'm not just saying this
because I'm your friend.
Your food is abysmal!
-Ross?
-What? What?
-I am freaking out!
-That is seven days.
I had a lot of water.
Can we do this after..?
No, no, no, no, Ross!
We don't have any big stuff we need.
We don't have a
changing table or a crib.
-We do not have a diaper service.
-There's nothing to worry about.
There's a baby store on West th.
We'll go there..
-and get everything we need. Okay?
-Okay. Thank you. That's great.
Where on West th?
then I'm gonna go do that, so..
-Wait, Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing.
-Yeah.
Our situation, you know,
what we mean to each other..
and, I mean, we're having this baby
or at the movie?
-We said at the movies, but..
-I'll see you there.
-Now that you're here..?
-I'll hang out till I have to meet you.
-How come you're not going?
-And they say you don't pay attention.
It's a better job.
It's vice president of the company..
that does data reconfiguration
for other companies.
-Wow. How do you know how to do that?
-What?
Remember the guy that gave me
a bad review? Well..
I'm getting my revenge.
You cooked him?
No. He teaches a course
at The New School..
I want to make him try
page tomorrow
"Restaurant reviewer admits
'I was wrong about Monica.'"
The front page?
You really do live in your own
little world, don't you?
-I better get to my movie.
and you're going to the movie..
why don't we just go together?
How's that for data reconfiguration,
huh, Chand?
My name's Katie if there's
anything else you need.
Oh, God, I don't know. I want.. Everything
-I don't know.
Have you ever had two people
who weren't wearing crowns..
spend this much money here?
You have selected a lot of nice things.
You want these delivered,
Mr. and Mrs. Geller?
-Oh, no, no.
-We are having a baby..
but we're not involved.
I mean, we were seeing
each other a while ago..
but then we were just friends, and
then there was one drunken night..
Or, yes, stranger,
-Oh, okay.
-You picked out a lot of dinosaurs.
-Yeah.
That's one of the reasons
why we're not a couple.
I chose those. I'm a paleontologist.
Really? That is so cool.
Don't get too worked up. It sounds
-I teach it in class.
Standing at a cash register, I'm
holding a credit card, and I'm bored.
I love your neighborhood.
There's a great gym around the corner.
-That's my gym.
You're like Indiana Jones.
I am like Indiana Jones.
-Hi, Pheebs.
-Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
Great! We got everything we needed.
Oh, and Ross almost got
something that wasn't on the list.
A whore.
What?
We were paying, and this sales
-Yeah.
Oh, my God. Well, the idea..
A woman flirting with a single man?
-We must alert the church elders.
-No.
You don't understand.
-No, I'm not.
I just think it's wrong.
I mean, here I am, about to pop..
and he's out picking up
some shopgirl at Sluts-R-Us?
Is that a real place?
Are they hiring?
Hey, Phoebe. Fatty.
Why so fancy?
I got a job interview.
It's more money, and I'd be doing
-Me. I do that.
So do I look okay?
I'm nervous.
Oh, yeah. You look great.
You know, just don't
get your hopes up.
-Why not?
-You know.
You don't make a very good
first impression.
-What?
-Oh, you don't know.
-Are you serious?
making jokes..
You come off a little needy.
Did you like me when we first met?
Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to you.
But I am gonna run away from you.
She's put on so much weight.
There he is.
That smug bastard.
Okay, class.
We'll see you next time.
There he is.
Hi. I'm Monica Geller,
my bouillabaisse again.
I don't see why I'd do
that to myself again.
Either eat it or be in it.
Spoon?
-What do you think?
-I'm torn..
between my integrity
Your soup is abysmal.
Thattagirl! We should get out of here,
there's a new class coming in.
Welcome to Introduction to Cooking.
Can anyone tell me the difference
between hollandaise and bearnaise sauce?
-I can.
and butter base.
But a bearnaise has shallots,
chervil, and most importantly, tarragon.
Very good. What's your name?
-You go to the head of the class!
-Okay!
This stuff takes up a lot of room.
How serious are you about keeping
What are you doing here?
The delivery went out
and they forgot this.
It must have been obvious, since it
was the only thing left in your store.
Listen, to be honest, home deliveries
to ask you out.
Oh. Wow.
Yeah, that sounds great.
I'm just gonna put this back in my
pocket and pretend that didn't happen.
I'm free now.
-Horny bitch.
No, you're a horny bitch!
No, you're a horny bitch!
No, you're a horny bitch!
You guys have a good time.
I'm just gonna grab my coat.
And my whip.
You know, because of Indiana Jones.
Not because I'm into S & M.
I'm not into anything weird, you know?
Just normal sex.
So I'm gonna grab my coat.
So you had a good day, huh?
You guys have fun.
-Okay.
-Yeah.
Nice to see you.
Oh, and it was great to see you too.
And you look fantastic.
-Although you missed a button.
what you're doing there.
I can't even believe this.
I really come off that badly?
It's okay. You calm down
after a while..
and then people see
interview will last weeks.
All right, don't freak out, okay?
I will help you.
-How long before you have to leave?
-An hour.
-I can't help you.
and I'm meeting you for the first time.
-Okay.
-Hi. Come on in. I'm Regina Phalanges.
-Chandler Bing.
-Oh, Bing.
-What an unusual name.
Did you use your cheese?
When you say "use," do you mean
"eat as a pre-cooking snack"?
-And the cream?
-Cheese makes me thirsty.
-Okay. Let's move on.
over at Monica's station.
My God! This is amazing!
You've never made this before?
Oh, no. I don't know anything
about cooking.
I had to ask what it was called when
-Your mouth was full. I didn't hear.
-Hats off to who?
-The chef!
That's right!
You'll find that I don't micromanage.
I don't shy away from delegating.
That's good to know. But let's stop
for the people working with me.
Nice sidestep on the "do do" thing.
-Hardest thing I've ever done.
-Oh, you gotta go!
-Don't worry. You're ready.
-Really?
Absolutely! Just fight all your
And I made them all by myself.
I mixed the ingredients,
I put them in the oven, I took them out.
Granted, I should have used
the oven mitts, but still.
Monica, my star student.
You called me that before,
cookies, you give me the star.
Wow, a star!
I know you all hate me,
and I'm sorry, but I don't care.
-Okay, Joey, you're up next.
-Yeah.
Oh, my God! This is amazing!
You get an A.
I got an A? In school?
-Excuse me?
-He doesn't know what he's doing.
-Nobody knows what they're doing.
I do. I'm a professional chef!
Oh, relax. It's not a courtroom drama.
Why are you taking
Introduction to Cooking?
Yeah!
I'm sorry. I cook at this restaurant,
-You do?
You're a great chef.
As a person you're a little..
-Oh, I'm crazy, but you liked the food?
-Very much.
Okay, then. I don't stink.
it's time to go, it's time to go!
I was the point person on my company's
transition from the KL to GR systems.
-You must have had your hands full.
-That I did. That I did.
So let's talk a little bit
so you'll have a lot of duties.
-I see.
-But there'll be  people under you..
so you can dump
a certain amount on them.
-Good to know.
answer for you on Monday.
But I can say with some
confidence, you'll fit in well here.
-Really?
-Absolutely.
-You can relax. You did great.
I'm told I come on too strongly.
And then it was really hard
to sidestep that "duty" thing.
Duties?
Doodies?
Poo?
Poo?
Oh, my God. This doesn't count. Okay?
The interview was over.
That was the real Chandler Bing.
out in the hall!
Poo?
I'll look forward to your call.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-You're back.
-How are you?
I'm fine. But that's not important.
We just had coffee.
Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee,
a little rub-rub-rub under the table?
What's going on?
Do you not like Katie?
No. No, she was nice. I mean,
if it called you Indiana Jones.
Did you get a fresh batch
of pregnancy hormones today?
No. It's just that..
Katie bothered me.
Why? What was wrong with her?
There was nothing wrong with her.
-I don't want you to date her.
Why? What, are you jealous?
Yes. And not because
I want you to go out with me.
Because I don't want you
to go out with anybody.
It's terrible to even think this
beck and call,  hours a day.
I'm very sorry, but that is
just the way that I feel.
-Okay.
-What?
I won't date. I'll..
I'll be here with you all the time.
Really?
But I'm being so unreasonable.
True, but you're allowed to be
the baby into my bladder..
and now I have to pee.
-Okay.
-Rach?
-Yeah?
-Just one thing..
We live together. You're having our
something more?
Wow. I don't know, maybe..
Oh, Rach, I was just messing around.
-Like you did when I had to pee?
-Oh! I knew that.
I knew that!
I was just messing with you too!
Okay. Because for a minute
-Like you actually..
That's just because I'm such
a good messer!
-Rach?
-Yeah?
-The bathroom?
ate great food.
It's my first A since th grade and
I didn't even sleep with the teacher.
-Oh, look. Acting for Beginners.
-Yeah.
-Wanna feel good about yourself?
between upstage and downstage is?
Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
What are you looking at?
A poster for that WWI movie I'm in.
Check it out.
Wow! It looks really violent!
I know. I'm coming soon
to a theater near you.
I'm in THX.
-It's generating Oscar buzz.
-I started that!
-I thought I did!
I just talked to my agent..
and the premiere is next week
and you're all invited!
-Will we take a limo?
when nobody died.
Well, I won't be able to come.
For those who haven't checked
their calendars, today's my due date.
You should come.
Maybe you'll have the baby in the limo.
That way for the first few moments of
for how great you've been during this.
I couldn't have done it without you.
I loved these last  months.
I'm looking forward
to the next part..
I am really gonna miss
sweaty pregnant lady..
disturbing your precious
coffee time?
Come on, people, make some room.
Sweetie, maybe you'd be
more comfortable here.
You.
Like you haven't done enough.
I know you're miserable.
They carry the babies.
And then also,
I'd be far away in the sea.
God.
I have never been so uncomfortable
in my entire life.
I know. I remember toward the end..
That's a great story. Tell it while
Get out, get out, get out!
Let's.
Hey, did you have the baby yet?
Do you want me to sit on you?
Because I'll do it.
-What are you doing here?
-They sent me home from work.
They said, "Start your maternity
I'll hang out with you guys.
Or you could do volunteer work.
-Hello?
-Joey, it's Estelle.
I was able to get you and one guest
tickets to your premiere.
-You told me I could have six tickets.
to bring one guest?
Yeah. What time you
wanna pick me up?
Hello?
You hear that? I only get one
extra ticket to my premiere.
So somehow I have to pick
-You said you didn't want to go.
I don't. But I would
still like to be acknowledged.
-Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisible?
-Definitely not invisible.
Ross didn't care enough
-He's not snoozing. He's teaching.
Well, then somebody's snoozing.
And, Joey, not that this should affect
you at all, but if you pick me..
I was planning on wearing
a sequin dress cut down to here.
-I haven't seen this dress.
to your heart. What does it tell you?
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe.
Well..
I think I want to take Chandler.
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.
-You want to take me?
-Yeah, I wish I could take everybody.
But Chandler's always
supported my career.
He's paid for acting classes,
of paying you back.
So you're never actually
going to pay me back?
Just because he paid for your
headshots, you're gonna take him?
I don't think you're comprehending
It's everything, you know?
He read lines with me. He went with me
on auditions when I was nervous.
Then he consoled me
after I didn't get parts that I wanted.
You always believed in me, man,
I'm so proud of you.
Thanks, that means a lot to me.
Mon, maybe one of these guys
wants to wear your dress.
-I'm gonna go shave.
-Yeah, well, I'm gonna go spit.
I have to pee.
If I don't come out, it's because I've
mouth and the kid'll just.. out of her.
She's a week late.
She's got to have it today.
I don't know. I think
it's still gonna be a while.
Care to make it interesting?
-I bet you she'll have it tomorrow.
-One hundred thousand dollars.
-How about  bucks?
-I'll call Zurich and move some money.
All right, whose turn is it
to help me get up?
No one's here.
Oh, damn it!
This is exciting. So glamorous! People
-What?
Would you crouch down a bit
so that I look taller?
There you go.
It's just so glamorous.
Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.
And you're still pregnant.
I'm sorry. I know
how uncomfortable you are.
You know what? You look great.
thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.
Damn it. Here's your  bucks.
That's interesting that you lost.
Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
All right, stop it.
-Double or nothing she has it tomorrow.
-Fine.
Until then, General Grant, why don't
-In the bathroom.
-Rach, we gotta go.
-In a minute!
People ask why we're not together.
I just don't know what to tell them.
All right, let's go.
Oh, wait a minute.
Do I have to pee again?
No, I'm good.
Do you want to go change first?
The doctor's staying open late for us,
-You don't think that's inappropriate?
-What?
-Good God, man. Don't anger it.
Ross, it is  degrees outside.
For the first time in weeks, I am..
Fine. Whatever you want.
your own mother that.
I'm actually with her on this one.
Come on, Ross.
We're gonna be late.
Either of you want to be Ross?
I thought I knew who the enemy was,
but it was you.
Okay, this is it. This is
in the nd Ground Division.
Ross?
Can I ask you something?
When Carol was pregnant with Ben..
were you this irritating?
-Excuse me?
-Nothing. You're just..
You've been a little short with me
a natural talent for it.
The doctor will be in soon.
Why don't we not speak until then?
Okay.
Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross.
That's great.
We should ask the doctor
that's half human, half pure evil!
-Hi, Dr. Long. How are you?
-You're nice to her.
She has the drugs.
We'll do a quick check.
Eight days late, huh?
You must be getting uncomfortable.
Yeah, just a tad.
You're % effaced. You're on your way.
-Do them!
Actually, they're things
that you can do. Home remedies.
In my experience, I've found
some are very effective.
-Well, we are ready to try anything.
There's spicy foods.
We will do all of those.
-Taking a long walk.
-Good. Done.
And there's the one that's
proved most effective sex.
You've got to be kidding me!
Good job, Joe! Well done! Top-notch!
-You liked it? You really liked it?
-The whole thing! Here we go!
No, no, no. Give me some specifics.
I loved the specifics.
The specifics were the best part.
Hey, what about the scene with
the kangaroo? Did you like that part?
I was surprised to see a kangaroo
take any of my suggestions!
-I can't believe you fell asleep.
-I can't believe it either.
Maybe it didn't happen.
Maybe you fell asleep
and dreamt the whole thing.
And this conversation we're having
-Don't go. I'm so sorry.
Look, this guy fell asleep!
He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!
Or call an ambulance!
What did the doctor say?
Any news on when the baby will come?
No. She gave us ideas
castor oil, spicy food. Nothing worked.
There is one thing we didn't try.
But someone thinks that
that will open up a can of worms.
If it's gonna help
bring the baby here, today..
I think you should do it.
-It's sex.
-It's been a really long time for you.
I mean, women have needs.
Do it. Get yours.
Oh, I don't know about that.
I think if the two of you had sex, the
repercussions would be catastrophic.
All right, let's be practical.
If Ross isn't willing, he's not
Chandler is good.
Okay, okay. Yeah,
I don't think I wanna do that.
You sure? I'm just saying..
the baby's head
isn't getting any smaller.
Monica, what is the matter with you?
-I just want the baby to be born today.
the baby, and I don't want to lose.
What? While she's been going through
this hell, you've been making money?
You're betting on your friend
staying in this misery?
-I'll take that bet.
make some money out of it.
Can I get some of that action?
I'm betting against all of you?
I really feel like
tomorrow it's gonna happen.
Okay.
Sixty, , .
And .
And two.
Yeah, baby.
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.
Where have you been? I want
to talk to you. I still feel bad.
Oh, no. Were you upset?
between us. You've done a lot for me.
I wanted to pay you back
with the premiere, but you missed it.
-So how much do I owe you?
-What?
-I don't want to owe you anything.
-We're doing this!
You got me my first headshots.
How much?
-I don't know, $.
-Okay, $. What else?
Then there was the second set.
That's  and . That's..
-You want a calculator?
-Please.
Here.
All right, what else?
Well, there's acting classes,
stage-combat classes, tap classes..
Which we're still keeping
with a Southern accent.
Which, after  hours of lessons,
still came out Jamaican.
What the hell are you talking about?
The South will rise again, man.
Yes, money well-spent.
Okay, what else? Rent.
Two, three years of rent,
a check for..
So you fell asleep during my movie.
Big deal, right?
How do you clear this thing?
Finish your enchilada.
Ross, we've tried all the spicy food.
It's not working.
Okay, here, have one of these peppers.
Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.
By the way, you don't want to touch
watching you do that..
really makes me want
to have sex with you.
-Stop it.
-Come on! Why are we wasting time?
We know it's gonna work.
some boundaries. My God, I'm dying.
We've done it before.
We'll do it again.
It'll be a nice way
to bookend the pregnancy.
I'm not gonna make love to you
into a man's pants.
You'll be performing a service.
Think of me as a ketchup bottle.
Sometimes, you have to bang on
the end of it to get it to come out.
I love when you talk dirty to me.
I know it. You're right.
This is not going to happen.
Come on, Ross. I'm miserable here.
Come on, you started this,
now you finish it!
Come on, wuss. Make love to me.
-You know what?
-What?
Forget it.
What now, Ross,
clear up your sinuses, but no!
That's not enough..
What are you doing?
I'm getting that baby out of you!
-Oh, God!
-I know.
Oh, no, no, no.
I think my water just broke.
I am good!
Okay, I got the pillow.
-I got the keys.
We're having a baby.
I didn't have time to read this part
of the books, but do we have time..?
-Not so much.
-Okay, let's go.
-.
the baby comes. No more betting.
Okay.
Hello?
I guess we could bet
one more time.
-Is Rachel having the baby?
-How did you know that?
-Joey! Chandler!
is over  pounds.
I bet you it has hair!
I bet you it's a girl.
-We know it's a girl.
-I'll give you really good odds.
All right!
Yes! From home to the hospital
to a great start, aren't we?
I knew I'd get here fast, but this
has gotta be some kind of a record!
-Oh, you made it!
-Hi.
-How the hell did you beat us here?
But I did test runs..
Hey, you made it!
Okay, is there some kind of magic
tunnel to this hospital?
Ross, you stay here and talk.
I'm gonna go have a baby.
Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Greene.
labor room waiting for you, so..
Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semi-private?
We asked for a private room.
Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately,
we can't guarantee a private room.
-And, currently, they're all unavailable.
are all we have.
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?
Yeah?
-Give her some money.
-I really think they're out of rooms.
They're not, Ross. They're just
saving them for important people!
Okay? What if I was the president?
Well, then, we'd be in a lot of trouble.
may have opened up?
This is a hospital.
Okay, I see.
Could we please talk to the manager?
There is no manager.
Just nurses, doctors
and semi-private rooms.
Okay, you know what? I have to say,
city, and we have no problem.. Oh, gosh!
-What? What?
-Contraction!
-Would you like to see a semi-private room?
-Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
Well, you're only two centimeters
-Oh, okay.
-I'll be back in an hour to check you again.
-Thank you.
Oh, wait, Dr. Long.
Can I ask you something?
Is labor really as painful
My beeper's going crazy.
Hey, don't.. You know what?
You're gonna be fine.
-I guess we have some time to kill.
-Yeah, guess so.
Oh, check these out.
Never done this before.
Doesn't feel good.
Yeah, well, it looks great.
Thank you very much.
this magical day for you.
Oh, no, not at all. It's okay.
Marc Horger. This is my wife, Julie.
-Hi, Julie. This is Rachel.
-Oh, hi, Rachel.
-Is this your first?
you need anything at all, just holler.
-That's so sweet.
-Yeah.
-Let me give you guys some privacy.
-Nonsense. We're all in this together.
We are gonna share every
-Yeah.
-Oh, okay, I guess.
-Hey, smile!
-I don't know if..
-I really don't want any..
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Ross!
-Oh, my God!
Hey, look at this.
-Here you go!
-Oh, no!
Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.
The miracle of birth
sure is a snooze-fest.
-Hey, you wanna see something?
Watch me freak out Chandler.
-Honey?
-Yeah?
Listen, I've been doing
some thinking..
and I don't know whether
try to have a baby.
Okay.
What's that now?
Okay. I've been thinking about it too,
and I think we're ready.
Are you kidding? You think
we're ready to have a baby now?
This is fun.
You're ready to have a baby?
try to get your voice all high and weird..
Like mine is now!
Yes, but haven't you
wanted a kid, like, forever?
Yeah, but no one ever wanted
to have one with me. I mean..
Now I'm just gonna have a baby if I
-That's it, right there! That's all I wanted!
I am sorry. The doctor insisted
on closing the curtain for the exam.
Oh, that's very..
Really, very, very okay.
Julie's cervix is dilated seven
-Have you felt Rachel's cervix, Ross?
-No, I don't.. We're not gonna do that.
-We won't be doing that.
Well, if you like, you could feel
Rachel's, then feel mine to compare.
-Am I interrupting?
-Oh, I'm sorry.
No, Ross? Ross? Ross?
My child has no father!
I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna
be a while. I wish you'd called first.
That's all right.
-Okay. What's up?
Ross, I want to talk
to you as your mother..
even though I know that you and I
are also very close friends.
I really don't know what
that I want to give you.
Assuming, of course, that you want it.
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
This is your grandmother's engagement
ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
-Mom, no. Come on. Thank you.
-Just hear me out..
No! Okay? We've been through this.
We're not gonna get married
you picked up in a bar and humped.
You think young people use
that word more than we actually do.
Ross, a child should have a family.
You know what? I can't deal
with this right now. I'm sorry.
Go.. Hey, go talk to Monica.
She got a new haircut.
I'll talk more about humping.
Give me.
-Hi, dear.
-Hi. Thank you so much for coming.
Ross, get in here!
You wanna see something funny?
Monica.
Okay. All right, stop it.
You're freaking me out.
Do it again. Do it again.
Hey, Rachel had the baby.
-What?
I thought that'd be funny.
You said hi to Mom
before she left, right?
I thought that was her.
Yeah, I called her name,
and she ducked into a stairwell.
Well, you know what?
to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.
-Oh, my God.
-How annoying.
Yeah.
-Why aren't you with Rachel?
-You're kidding, right?
Look, we're not gonna be together
just some girl I humped..
Oh, humped?
Come on, Ross.
But it just seems that
you two belong together.
Okay, stop it. I can't deal with this
right now. I have to go have a baby.
Right. And with who again?
He's crazy. Why doesn't
I mean, I know she turned me down..
but if she hadn't
and she wanted to be with me..
I would take her in my arms and..
I haven't bummed you guys out
like this in a while, have I?
-Hey.
-New people.
What happened to the Disgustingtons?
They're having their baby.
It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!
Right after you left,
they wheeled her off into delivery.
Oh, but not before she gave me a nice,
pet names for each other.
Including "Evil Bitch"
and "Sick Bastard."
-Oh, gosh, a contraction.
-Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.
-Are you looking at her?
-Honey, I swear I wasn't looking at her!
She's in labor. You like that,
you sick son of a bitch?
I'm just gonna..
See? It's because you were looking,
you fat pervert.
No, no. I'm sure no one was looking.
-Yeah.
-Ross.
-What?
-He's looking at me.
-Hey!
You wanna live to see your baby?
Don't you talk to my husband like that,
a baby so bad, just go steal it!
Oh, don't worry.
These babies are far too ugly for us.
What is going on with you.
Since when are you so crazy about babies?
I'm not crazy about babies.
babies someday, not now..
but I'm starting to think that we
can handle it. We're good.
We're really good.
We are pretty good.
But nothing has to happen
until you're ready.
Well, maybe I'm ready now.
I mean, it's a little scary,
We're not ready to have a kid now!
-What?
-I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.
So we're gonna try?
I mean, we're trying?
We're trying to get pregnant.
I'm not comfortable doing
-All right, hold on a sec.
-Period math?
-Yeah.
Well, we could start trying now.
-Right here?
-No, not here.
Maybe here.
It's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill,
-No.
-I'll see you downstairs then.
-All right.
Hey, I got one! I got one!
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Oh, up or down?
but can I just do it?
-Could you press up too?
-Sure.
-I feel bad. I broke my leg once too.
-Yeah? How'd yours happen?
Well, it's a long story,
typographical error with a sex manual.
-How about you?
-Car accident.
Some idiot on a cell phone
wasn't paying attention?
Yeah. Me.
-Sorry.
And I was pretty lucky.
Well, I, for one, am glad you made it.
Are you sure?
I mean, you don't know me.
I could have been sent
from another planet to destroy Earth.
Couldn't press the "down" button.
just visiting someone.
Well, if you have some time
and you wanna visit someone else..
Yeah, I would like that.
-Great. I'm in room..
-Wait! What? No! Elevator! No!
You gotta press the button.
The nurse said
She'll still have the baby before I do.
-Oh, Ross! Another contraction.
-Oh, okay. Here, here.
That's it.
-Oh, that sounded like a bad one.
-Yeah, it was.
Mine haven't been so bad.
Are you okay, honey?
I'm okay, honey.
Well, I got some bad news.
It gets worse.
And when you get to the end,
they get really big..
and they come, like, every minute.
Well, mine are pretty close together.
-Yeah, that's quite all right.
Oh, by the way, my name's Johanna.
What's yours?
Excuse me, could you help me
with something?
I'm looking for a man.
Well, who isn't?
You. You aren't.
Good for you.
Anyway, the patient
to mid-s, very attractive.
Even you would think so.
-I know who you're talking about.
-Great! What room number is he in?
I'm sorry.
Patient information is confidential.
No, I'm not gonna bother him.
is restricted to hospital staff.
-She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray.
-Dr. Drake who?
Ramoray. It's Portuguese.
We need that information. I'm a doctor.
-A doctor at this hospital?
on your head..?
-Hands.
-Hands!
It is absolutely essential that you tell me
what room he is staying in.
He's a patient of mine.
-. Thank you.
-And what is his name?
-No.
-I think we found a place.
-Okay.
Wait. Wanna set the mood a little?
Hello, Monica.
-Not like that.
-Okay.
Or turn them out altogether.
No scented candles.
Okay, here. There we go.
Okay, okay.
Making me sterile, but okay.
Okay. I'm sorry. Oh, wait.
-Great. Go get him!
Wait a second.
Or maybe you could go in first.
He's not really my type.
Not you. Dr. Ramoray. Ask him
questions and see what he's like.
-People tell doctors everything.
then turn out to be big jerks.
-You do attract some stinkers.
-Yeah, I know.
Dr. Long, I've been at this
for  hours.
Three women have come
centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
-Three.
-Just three?
I'm dilated three!
We are moving along just slowly.
Don't worry, you're doing great.
-I'll be back soon.
I'm gonna push this baby out.
I'm doing it. Three centimeters.
That's gotta be like this, right?
-Actually, it's more like this.
-Oh, stupid metric system.
We're gonna need to take you straight
routine questions I need to ask you.
Really? I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.
I know. I'm a neurologist.
Just to be on the safe side..
Dr. Wells wanted a more
comprehensive overview. So he sent me.
Dr. Wells is a woman!
That was a test. Good response.
-All right. Full name?
-November , .
Age?
-Can't you figure that out?
-I'm a doctor, not a mathematician.
-I'm .
-Okay.
-And are you married?
you say you have commitment issues?
Are all the questions this personal?
Yes.
Well, if you must know, I'm a widower.
-Oh, that's terrible. I'm really sorry.
-Yeah.
I lost my wife five years ago
to a mild cardial infarction.
-A heart attack, doctor.
-No.
Do you sleep with women
and never call them again?
-No.
-Excellent. Excellent.
And finally, are you into any weird
-Wrong answer.
-This room's available.
-Okay! Wait, you listen to me!
Since I have been waiting,
four women..
that's four, one higher than
I'm next. It's my turn. It's only fair.
If you bring in one more woman who has
her baby before me, I will sue you.
Not this hospital. I'm gonna sue you.
My husband is a lawyer.
-Rach?
patient is very far along.
Okay. Well, then bring her in.
Oh, my God!
I can't believe this!
And yet, somehow, it's true.
I mean, this is so great.
We're gonna be baby buddies!
Squeeze your legs together
and cover the baby's ears.
-Hi, sweetie!
you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid.
I nabbed him a year ago
at the dermatologist's office.
Thank God for adult acne!
I still can't believe it.
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
Really?
What'd he say?
You have to speak very loudly,
-Of course he is.
Congratulations, you two.
I didn't even know you got married.
-Oh, we didn't.
-What?
We're just having this baby together,
But we're very excited about this.
Oh. Well, then shut me up.
Just tell me how.
Oh, I feel another one coming.
Sid, you lucky, deaf bastard.
-What else? What else?
-He's .
A widower.
He seemed like a standup guy.
And he's not into anything weird sexually.
Enter Phoebe!
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty
while I remove my pants!
Okay, mister! Fertilize me!
Does that sound like Janice?
If it's not, then there's two of them.
And that would mean
it's the end of the world!
Hey.
-Hey.
-Hi.
I can't believe this is taking so long.
to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
And soon someone will call her "Mom."
Weirdest thing. Did I hear..?
Mother of God, it's true!
Chandler Bing!
Janice.
Not just Janice. Janice in labor.
Contracting and everything.
Oh, this should be easy.
I have a very wide pelvis.
You remember, Chandler.
I feel so bad for you.
She's your ex. And I have Richard.
Janice, I didn't even know
whose essence you've stolen?
It's you.
This is yours.
What?
Look how nervous he gets!
We haven't slept together in years!
That's funny. Does it hurt?
Does the labor hurt?
Okay, I've got one for you.
that you're making me eat him.
-Oh. Somebody went to college.
-Yeah.
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.
Oh. I'll get it.
I usually get to know a girl better
before I let her spoon me.
Relax. It's not like we're forking.
When. When.
Thank you. Listen.
You seem to really know
-Yeah?
Yeah. And I promise I won't make
you eat any remarkable animals.
I was thinking..
I'd kind of like to make a move.
But, you know, with the leg.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe a little help.
Okay.
Let me fix your pillow.
Cliff, you're so forward.
Oh, it was really nice meeting you.
Sid!
That's the first time I heard her voice.
I didn't care for it.
Oh, that's five, Ross.
Five women have had five babies..
and I have had no babies.
Why doesn't she want to come out?
You know what I think it is?
that she just doesn't want to leave.
Oh, look at you making up crap for me.
-Oh, God.
-Okay. Okay.
Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.
Doctor, you gotta do something!
Get me drugs..
or light a fire up in there
to the delivery room.
What?
Ten centimeters.
You're about to become a mom.
Oh, my God. Okay.
Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.
Is this the same spoon
that was in my cast?
You know what?
This one is.
Oh, my God! That's the doctor
closed-circuit hospital channels.
No, no. That's a soap opera.
This is a very dramatic hospital.
I'm telling you,
the guy from that show was here..
asking me all these weird questions.
Okay, Mr. Percocet.
I swear to you, that's the guy.
Okay, Cliff.
Do you really believe that a character
from a TV show was here in your room?
What probably happened was you were
to me as a neurologist. I..
That's him! You know him?
Wake up, Cliff!
What is going on?
Okay. Okay. I.. Okay.
I sent my friend, Joey,
in here to find out stuff about you.
If it.. You know, if it helps,
you came off great.
A lot better than I'm coming off
to pretend he was a fake doctor?
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
-You tried making me think I was crazy?
-That was wrong. I'm so sorry.
It's just that I liked you so much.
Can we just start over?
I don't think so.
If I may? You told me a lot
some personal stuff about her.
She was married to a gay ice dancer.
She gave birth to her
brother's triplets.
Her twin sister used to do porn.
-We're trying to dial down the crazy.
-Right.
We don't really know each other,
I don't know about you..
but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
-It doesn't happen to me either.
-Me neither!
-The baby! Rachel!
-Right, right!
Oh, I love this scene.
Okay, look. I gotta go too.
But.. What do you say?
-Great! Okay.
All right, then I'll see you later.
Our friend's having a baby.
-Her own?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.
No, she's really old-fashioned.
Push. Push. We're gonna push
for five more seconds.
Five, four..
Three, two, one! Oh!
The next contraction should be
-You're doing great.
Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.
-Come on.
-Push. Wait.
-I see something.
-What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!
-Don't say "Oh, my God!" What?!
-Oh, God!
Is she gonna be okay?
-She's gonna be fine.
-Okay.
She's in a more difficult position,
so you have to push harder now.
-Okay.
-Yes, you can. I know you can do this.
I had no idea.
Please, you do it for me!
Let's go. One more time.
One final push. Ready? One, two, three.
Good.
Keep pushing!
Are you okay?
You have no idea how much this hurts.
Keep going! Keep going!
Here we go!
She's upside down, but she's coming!
-Oh, God!
-They're just wrapping her up.
Okay. Well, be careful with her,
she's really tiny.
Here she is.
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.
I know. Oh.
She's looking at me. Hi. I know you.
-Do we have a name yet?
-No, not yet.
That's fine. For now we'll just
-Oh, come on in.
-Oh, there she is.
-Oh, she's so beautiful.
Here.
Oh, my God. She's amazing.
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk
and had sex.
It's incredible. I mean,
here she is.
She looks so real.
You know what I mean.
She's this whole tiny little person.
And she already has eyelashes
and knees and..
-What?
-Oh, no, no. It's okay.
For a second, I counted six fingers, but one
-Aunt Phoebe.
Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.
I won't.
-Honey, what's the matter?
-Nothing. I just can't stop crying.
The doctor said it's normal, with all
the hormones, plus you're sleep-deprived.
So. You guys are all sleep-deprived.
I don't see you weeping because you
-I was reliving it.
Do you know what you're gonna
call her yet?
Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?
I thought that was so original.
Actually, we've narrowed it
So just pick one, and that'll be it.
Wow, okay. Everyone..
this is Isabella.
-Hi, Isabella!
-Hi.
What?
That's not her name.
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel
like an Isabella.
So then I guess Ferdinand is out.
-What was the other one?
sounds like a biblical whore.
So I guess we're back to Baby Girl.
What are we gonna do?
-It's okay. You'll find a name.
-Easy for you to say.
You already know what your
kids' names will be.
-You do?
some snack or baked good, isn't it?
-Well, tell us, what are they?
-Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.
-And if it's a girl?
-I don't wanna say.
Oh, stop. Tell us.
names that you're not gonna use?
-Take it.
-What?
She's clearly an Emma.
Oh, honey, but you love that name.
Yeah, but I love you more.
Besides, nothing goes with Bing.
So I'm screwed.
Hi, Emma.
Yep, that's you.
You're our little Em.
What's that, honey?
What?
Oh, you want a little cousin?
You want a cousin right now?
Do I look like a giant
-I know.
Hey, do you realize that we may have
just changed our lives forever?
We may have started our family.
In nine months we could be here..
having our own baby.
And if not, we got to do it
-Yeah.
You wanna do it again?
This time just for us?
Probably.
Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like
to say hello to his future bride.
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away,
doesn't he?
He's a keeper.
Look at the little munchkin.
Don't you worry. By the time
-Oh, I'm fine.
I really admire what you're doing.
Just raising her all alone.
I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
Sure. Now. But what happens when he
meets somebody else and gets married?
Well, then he gets a divorce.
until they start their real family.
-That's never gonna happen with Ross.
-That's what I thought.
I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend
a weekend with her father..
and little Miss New Boobs.
Really?
I hate to be the one to say it..
but, honey, you two are on your own.
Well, that's.. You know, that's..
We've been alone for the last
happening between me and Ross.
And right before I went into labor,
we had this kiss. You know?
So it might be the beginning
of something.
-Hey, Janice.
-Oh, no, no.
No.
-I'm gonna leave you three alone.
-Okay.
Man, you see the kid on that nose?
You know what I was thinking about?
That kiss before we left the apartment.
That was something, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.
But we.. We gotta be careful.
We.. You know, we can't let
-No. That's why I brought it up.
-They didn't have any sodas?
-Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I was talking to this nurse.
Completely forgot.
And so it begins.
She in there?
Yeah. She's putting her down now.
every baby is beautiful?
Except that one.
What is this? A petting zoo?
Look. Look at Emma.
I can't decide who she looks like,
you or Rachel.
Oh, what, are you kidding?
She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.
I'm sorry. For the last time,
Because you're not in that place.
Which would be fine,
except you totally are.
It's complicated, okay?
Yeah, that's true.
You love her, you always have,
you have a child together.
There's no right answer.
Look, we've been together.
and it didn't work out..
I could never do that to Emma.
I mean, she came into this world
thinking everything.. Now me.
What, do they put something
in the water here?
It's just, Rachel and I,
you might wreck it.
-Yeah, exactly.
-Right.
Or you might get everything
you've wanted since you were .
Hey.
I saw a woman breast-feeding
-Nothing.
What is it? Hey.
-Really, it's nothing. I'm..
-Rach, come on. What?
I've just been thinking about how
my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
What are you talking about?
The twins and little Miss New Boobs.
Okay, how long
was I watching that woman?
I'm just saying that, you know..
someday Ross is gonna
meet somebody..
and he's gonna have his own life.
Right?
Yeah, I guess so.
I just never thought I'd be raising
I won't let that happen.
Joey. Oh, sweetie,
what would I do without you?
You don't have to worry about that,
okay?
Could you grab me my other box
-Sure.
Oh, my God!
Joey?
Oh, my God.
Okay.
