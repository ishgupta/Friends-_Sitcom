Phoebe, that's great, but--
So you're not convinced. That's aII right
<iI thought he was gay</i
<i>But here I am singing</i>
<i>On his wedding day</i>
Phoebe, no.
If you'd Iet me finish, it goes on

You guys don't have this probIem,
I feeI a IittIe....
You know what? Never mind.

Don't worry about it. You're probabIy

-Happy Monica's Night.

WeII, sure,
but I get married aII the time.
-You okay?
-Yeah, I guess.
Do you think we'II ever have that?
You mean ''we,'' you and me?
Oh, no, no, no.
''We,'' you with someone,
we were Iike a nightmare.
-No, but there were some good times.
-AbsoIuteIy. Like, there was....
-SureIy you can think of something.
Oh, weII, yes.
I can think of one good thing.
You were aIways good at the...
...stuff.
I was good at the stuff?
I reaIIy Iiked your hands.
My hands?
Way to go, guys.
You were reaIIy good at the stuff too.
Oh, I know.
What are you thinking about?
Hey, you know what we never did?
Oh, no, not that.
We never had a bonus night.
-A what?

One night, just se<i>x</i>?
No strings attached?
-Yeah, yeah, we never had that.
-No.
Okay, this is getting a IittIe crazy.
I'm sure it wouId be amazing...
...but I reaIIy don't think
just don't hurt me.
You pIaying

That's whack.
PIayStation is whack.
'Sup with the whack PIayStation,
'sup?
Come on, am I   or what?
Yes, on a scaIe of one to ten, ten
And pIease, pIease, keep my underwear.
Thanks.
You've had a Iot of se<i>x</i>, right?
When, today?
Some, not a Iot.
The reason I'm asking
is because I had kind of a--
I was unabIe to--
I reaIIy wanted to, but I couIdn't--
I cannot beIieve I'm asking advice
from somebody who's wearing that hat.
I had an incident.
Don't worry about that, man.
-Yeah, once.
-WeII, what'd you do?
-I did it anyway.
Phoebe, come on, Iet's go.
Come on.
Why aren't you dressed yet?
I wrote the best song
for your wedding.
Check this out.
If you get ready now, you can pIay.
-ReaIIy?!
I'II have to pound on you a IittIe bit.
Fair enough. Get ready.
I'II get everybody.
FinaIIy we can start ceIebrating my--
I'm sorry, apparentIy I opened
the door to the past.
Okay, Monica, Mon.
Why tonight?
I waited my whoIe Iife
to be engaged...
...and unIike some,
I onIy pIan on doing this once.
Maybe it's seIfish, I'm sorry, but I
getting back together.
See, you kind of stoIe my thunder.
We did not steaI your thunder.
We are not getting back together.
Yeah, no, and you know what?
Nobody even saw.
That's true.
-We just kissed.
Can I sing at your wedding?
Thunder being stoIen.
-Phoebe, it's nothing.
-Let's not make a big deaI of this.
It was a one-time thing.
It doesn't even matter.
Oh, my God.
I cannot beIieve you guys
are between a man and a woman.
AII right? Now, ChandIer
is doing the best he can.
I don't think that's
what they were taIking about.
No, but Iet's taIk about it.
What a great night.
-You guys kissed? This is huge.
No, it's not huge.
PeopIe thinking it's huge
has Ied Monica to beIieve...
...we're steaIing her thunder,
which we aren't.
We're stiII taIking about it.
That and ChandIer's probIem.
Monica, Iisten, Iisten.
WouId you feeI better if we stopped
-You got it.
Now, I can pass for  , right?
Yes, you can pass for  .
-ReaIIy?
-Yes.
-SeriousIy?
-SeriousIy?
SeriousIy, no. Okay? You can pIay
tais? Maybe no more for you though.
You know, I think I don't feeI Iike
going to the PIaza.
Monica, this is ridicuIous.
I don't want to taIk about it.
I don't. EspeciaIIy with you.
That is whack.
I'II pIay it at the wedding.
We'II see if they actuaIIy
you want to hear...
...Iike, ''You Iook  .''
Then they just take it away,
Iike, ''No, you don't.''
Monica won't take this away.
-WouIdn't she?
-WouId she?
WouId she?
WouId she?
WouId she?
It's starting
for some wood cheese right now.
Guess who.
Hey, I just reaIized we kind of Ieft
some stuff up in the air.
''I don't want to taIk,''
especiaIIy with me?
Why not especiaIIy you and me?
by that? ''EspeciaIIy you.''
-Who cares?
-I care.
And so do I.
I have to taIk to her.
WiII you Iet me get changed?
Am I going to Iet you watch me?
No.
I can't beIieve her.
there is going to be a wedding.
You are going to throw the bou<iq</iuet,
and then a honeymoon.
-Maybe in Paris.
-Paris?
We wiII take a moonIit waIk
on the bed and make Iove...
...not just because it's romantic,
but because I can.
I Iove you.
Don't say anything,
you might scare it away.
It's Paris.
so I need a smaII deposit.
You know, some good-faith money
to hoId the date.
We're not giving you a deposit
for our wedding.
Oh, I see.
They break your heart, don't they?
You know, I don't reaIIy need
sing at their wedding.
Yeah, and if you want to Iook  ,
then you--
You got to do something
about your eyes.
What's wrong with my eyes?
They give you away.
for   minutes.
-That'II get rid of my wisdom?
-Maybe   minutes for you.
Give her the deposit, give her
the ring. I don't care.
What did you mean
especiaIIy me?
What a great apoIogy.
And you accept. Bye-bye.
No, seriousIy, what was
the ''especiaIIy me'' part about?
Let's just say it's not the first time
with my cousin CharIie.
Third base.
It was aII everybody couId taIk about.
The onIy reason I did that
was because your party was so boring.
We had a caricaturist.
<i>Whenever I get married</i>
was Iike a miIIion years ago.
Yet here you are doing it again.
I don't want
to steaI your stupid thunder.
Why eIse wouId you have
made out with Ross?
Got me.
Easy, mimey, the moment has passed.
have this night.
I never wanted any part of your night.
No one was supposed to see us.
Is that why you did it in the secret
haIIway, where nobody ever goes?
RacheI, I've been thinking.
I don't think us getting together
tonight is such a good idea.
I'm caIIing it off.
Way to save your dignity, my man.
Mon, why, why wouId I ever want
a IittIe resentfuI.
Maybe you thought
you'd get married first.
Maybe you can't stand...
...that your formerIy fat friend
is getting married before you.
Oh, wow, that-- You know what?
on my engagement night.
WeII, somebody shouId.
Look, if we're gonna do this--
We're not.
She's just gonna think we are.
I see, so everybody wins.
-Who is it?
-It's Monica, open up.
Okay, Ross, stop it.
and I hope you get back together.
I warn you, the night
you announce your engagement...
...I'm going to announce
that I'm pregnant.
How is that ever going to happen?
Do you want to know why
-You don't.
-Okay, why?
-Because I was sad.
What do you mean?
Look, I am so...
...so happy for you guys.
But you getting married reminds me
of the fact that I'm not.
I'm not even cIose.
Maybe I just wanted
but you were so depressed...
...when Ross got married,
you sIept with ChandIer.
I don't care, she sIept with me.
Anyway, sweetie,
I am so sorry I ruined your night.
I'm sorry I aImost made you
-Thanks.
And RacheI...
...what can I say?
You missed your chance.
From now on, the onIy person who's
going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
<iWe thought Phoebe would leave</i
<i>But she just stayed and stayed</i>
<i>That's right, I'm here all night</i>
<iAnd Chandler will never get</i--
Hey, here's a doIIar.
Consider it a deposit.
PIease sing at our wedding.
Thank you.
I'II pound on him in the morning.

﻿
ChandIer, you're doing so weII
rest of your Iife thing. I thinks it's great.
-Hey. Who wants French toast?
-I'II have some.
Me too. Eggs and miIk in the fridge.
Thanks.
-What's the matter?
-Start?
Let's start the wedding pIans.
-Okay.
-AIready?
We got a Iot to do. We gotta think
about the fIowers, the music--
-I have thoughts on the music--
is show up and try to say the right name.
-What in God's name is that?
-Oh, my God, the wedding book?
I haven't seen that since fourth grade.
This baby has everything.
Take, you know, Iocations, for instance:
First organized aIphabeticaIIy,
wedding to John Lynch in the fifth grade.
Remember how I got sick
and Ross had to fiII in as a bridesmaid?
I was a brides-boy.
I don't smeII French toast, brides-boy.
The One With RacheI's Book
That concIusiveIy proves...
...that I had the idea
Let's take a Iook--
Phoebe, what are you doing here?
I need to taIk to you. It's urgent.
for a moment?
Do you know each other's hometowns?
Why don't you...?
What's going on?
WeII, not much. I was just thinking
that since they just got engaged...
...it wouId be nice
for a coupIe days?
Okay, sure. But what's wrong
with Monica and ChandIer?
Nothing. Why?
Phoebe, you said it was urgent.
Yeah, it is.
My movie starts in, Iike, five minutes.
Do you reaIize I have a cIassroom
Does anyone want to come to the movies?
I haven't cIeared the
budget with my parents...
A string <i>q</i>uartet for the processionaI,
a jazz trio for cocktaiIs...
...the Bay City RoIIers
for my si<i>x</i>th grade wedding.
You couIdn't get them anyway.
Ian doesn't even pIay anymore and Derek....
Derek is a name I shouIdn't know.
Mon, do you have another piIIow,
something a IittIe snuggIier?
Why are you napping here
-What-- The duck?
What the heII
did the damn duck do now?
WeII, he did not get sick
somewhere in there...
...and it was immediateIy found
invoIved in the wedding?
Of course you can Iook at it.
I want your opinion.
Here you go.
-What about centerpieces?
-Centerpieces!
-Roses or IiIies?
-Oh, my God, it's Iike one mind.
Guys, guys, you gotta Iet me nap.
I'm gonna get cranky.
Joey, there's a perfectIy good couch
across the haII.
Yes, it is perfectIy good...
...and it is not one of the pIaces
the duck got sick.
What?
-AII right, I'm gonna go.
but he did not eat your face cream.
Hey, IittIe buddy. How you feeIing?
What the heII is in that face cream?
That's so soft.

Oh, Ross, hi.
-Phoebe, what are you doing?
-Okay, Iet's taIk outside.
UnfortunateIy, this time wiII be counted
as part of your massage.
So try...
...and think reIa<ix</iing thoughts.
And don't touch any of my dinosaurs.
I know they're cooI, but they're mine.
Phoebe, you can't massage peopIe
in my apartment.
I did it at Monica and ChandIer's.
And they knew about it?
Okay, Ross, what is this reaIIy about?
This is my home and I want to be
to do the rest of my appointments.
I don't know what the big deaI is.
I don't want naked,

Hey, Joey. What are you doing?
Sweeping. Why?
The vicar won't be home for hours.
Joey, where did you Iearn that word?
Where do you think...

Yes, I am.
Great! Dad?
Thank you so much.

Oh, yeah.
-Dad, you don't--
WeII, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.
I stiII don't know how.

They wanted a scary story.
withdrawaI from the Monica wedding fund.
-What?
-You teII her, Jack. I can't do it.
You have the wedding fund, don't you?
We have it.
OnIy, now we caII it ''the beach house.''
You spent my wedding
you'd pay for it yourseIf.
You bought the beach house
when I was .
So you've had seven years
of beach fun...
...and you can't put a price on that.
We do feeI bad about this.
We saved again
so we redid the kitchen.
What about ChandIer?
It was ChandIer.
We didn't think he'd propose.
CIearIy I did not start drinking
enough at the start of the meaI.
I can't beIieve there's no money
-Stupid, Jack. The word is stupid.
Enough. I don't want
to hear about it anymore.
Good Iuck, ChandIer.
Okay, now I'm going to...
...touch you.
That's soft.
Why does Joey keep taIking
about chimney sweeps and vicars?
I thinks he's just been rehearsing
Iike a bad porn noveI.
Do you think your parents
couId heIp pay for it?
I don't know.
My mother spent most of her money
on her fourth wedding.
She's saving the rest for her divorce.
-My parents spent the wedding fund.
My God, what did you order?
Wait, there's no money?
WeII, this is terribIe.
You guys are gonna have to get
married in, Iike, a rec center.
Oh, my God, you're right.
We're gonna have to be out by  so they
-No, it's not gonna be okay.
-No swing band, no IiIies.
-No, but that's good.
You don't want IiIies.
If a cat ate them, it wouId die.
-What?
-I'm just saying, now you couId invite cats.
It's gonna be okay.
I mean, you don't need to have this...
...rustic ItaIian feast.
You don't need this custom-made...
...empire-waisted, duchess satin gown.
You can wear off-the-rack.
It's reaIIy gonna be okay.
The important thing is that we Iove each
''off-the-rack'' means?
Why don't you pay for it yourseIf?
How? I don't have any money.
-WeII, I have some.
-How much?
WeII, cIose to....
-Are you kidding me?!
-How much?
-Enough for wedding scenario A.
to break it to the cats and it won't be me.
How great are you, you IittIe saver!
This is e<ix</iactIy
the budget of my dream wedding.
You guys are so made for each other.
You're not suggesting that we spend
aII of the money on the wedding?
Yeah.
Look, Mon, I've been saving this money
for the future, not just for a party.
HeIIo, Mr. ChandIer.
Sweetie, this is the most speciaI day
of our Iives.
I reaIize that, honey, but I'm not gonna
spend aII the money on one party.
Honey, I Iove you.
But if you caII our wedding
We're onIy gonna get married once.
I understand, but I have to put
my foot down. The answer is no.
You're gonna have to ''put your foot down''?
Yes, I am.
Money and a firm hand.
FinaIIy a ChandIer I can get on board with.
-Hey, Rach.
-Joey.
Hey, Rach, do you smeII smoke?
I get it. Smoke, chimney,
You don't smeII it?
Something's on fire.
No, I don't smeII anything.
Oh, you know what? It's probabIy
just your burning Ioins.
-Hey, what are you guys taIking about?
-Nothing.
Damn, this coffee's coId.
Do you mind if I heat this up
you toId him. Joey....
So I guess you bought that book
after we broke up.
Yeah, I did, because I wore out
my first copy when I was with you.
Oh, yeah?
WeII, when we were going out,
to an oId man?
E<i>x</i>cuse me, Iadies.
I'm sorry?
My massage cIient, Arthur.
His daughter said some guy
that worked for me...
...gave him a reaIIy weird massage.
I gave him an e<i>x</i>tremeIy
professionaI massage.
He said you poked
a traditionaI massage.
But I did give him acupressure
with a pair of chopsticks...
...and I gentIy e<ix</ifoIiated him
with a mop.
WeII, he's never coming back.
You didn't move his appointment.
Oh, it's my fauIt?
You didn't have to massage him.
You couId've sent him away.
You couId've not roIIed Tonka trucks
up and down his back.
He said he Iiked that!
You're right, you're right.
an oId man for?
-His daughter was hot.
-Gotcha.
Look, Ross,
I reaIIy need that $ every week.
I'm sure you'II find
I'm going to massage you every week...
-...for the price of $  .
-You just said .
You want me to mess up your puzzIe?
A hundred it is.
HeIIo, ZeIda.
-Who are you supposed to be?
-The vicar.
-Do you even know what a vicar is?
you've been waiting aII your Iife for?
Joey, I'm serious, aII right? It's enough.
You make stupid jokes
and sIeazy innuendoes...
...and it's just not funny anymore.
I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry.
Maybe I couId make it up to you
by taking you roughIy in the barn.
AII right, that's it.
I wanna do it with you.
Been trying to fight it,
but you just said aII the right things.
I did?
Yeah. Oh, I've been waiting so Iong
to get on that body.
-This body?
the butcher's wife in chapter seven.
Come on, now. Don't keep me
waiting. Get those cIothes off.
But I'd keep that heImet on,
because you're in for a rough ride.
I don't want to. I'm scared.
Listen...
...I've been thinking.
It's not fair of me to ask you to
-WeII, you work for that.
Look, I've thought about it too.
I'm sorry. I think we shouId spend
aII of the money on the wedding.
-You do?
-Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.
Look, when I proposed,
to make you happy.
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy...
...then that's what we're gonna do.
You are so sweet.
What about the future and stuff?
Forget about the future and stuff.
So we onIy have two kids.
We'II pick our favorite and
that one wiII get to go to coIIege.
-Have you thought about that?
and another boy.
What eIse did you think about?
WeII, stuff Iike where we'd Iive,
you know.
Like a smaII pIace outside the city...
...where our kids couId Iearn
to ride their bikes.
We couId have a cat that had a beII
it ran through the IittIe kitty door.
We'd have an apartment over the garage
where Joey couId grow oId.
You know what?
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
-Sure you do.
-No.
I want everything that you've
-I Iove you.
When you were taIking
about our future, you said cat.
But you meant dog, right?
-Yeah, totaIIy.
-Oh, good.
Room temperature okay?
-Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you e<i>x</i>pecting a traditionaI massage
with the hands?
Fine.
Now, just try to reIa<i>x</i>.

So, what do you think?

No.
I think the gIasses Iook great.
-ReaIIy?

You shouId get them a

Yeah, and by ''someone''
she means Joey.
I know what I want!
-What we want, honey.
-No, you don't want this.
I want your grandmother's
cookie recipe?
The one my grandma

...that I wouId never

Dying peopIe say the craziest things.
I've wanted it for years. I was gonna

Our kids are gonna be fat,

Ahoy!
-How's the boat?
-I'm getting into this saiIing stuff.
You finaIIy took it out of the marina?
Why wouId I do that?
It took three guys
what do you do on it?
It's a great pIace to just sit...
...hang around, drink a few beers,

It's good that you finaIIy

I couId teach you to saiI if you want.
-You couId?

My pony was sick.
-You know what I was thinking?

Nothing, I just Iike to go Iike this.
-What are you doing tonight?
-Then, free as a bird. What's up?
My dad wants to know if you want
to pIay rac<i>q</i>uetbaII.
Great! Dad must Iike you!
He doesn't ask just anyone to pIay.
He didn't ask for you.
He asked for ''Chauncey.''
I assumed he meant you.
Did you correct him?
No, I thought it wouId be
do this every week.
Or you couId sit on the porch...
...and make sure no one
steaIs the trashcans.

Just so you know, you have to Iet

It was going great.
I Iet him win, we were bonding...

Oh, but he wiII.
He stiII teIIs the story about how
Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
I wasn't escaping.
Then how'd you get caught

You were trying to eat it.
If that is your father caIIing
I Iove you.
I'm off to see your dad.
Aren't you a IittIe overdressed?

Thank you!
Hey.

I don't know the boat way
RacheI is mean.
Yep, yep, yep.
I remember when she took me out

She wouIdn't Iet me heIp at aII.
E<i>x</i>cuse me, I wanted you to heIp.
But you couIdn't move...
...because you were wearing
three Iife jackets.
You have to respect the sea.
Joey, I'm sorry if you thought
yeII at me on the boat.
It was horribIe.
I was being a reaIIy good teacher.
Does a good teacher say,
''Put down the beer, pinhead!''
Does a good student drink seven beers
one out of my hand, remember?
I didn't want you to get hit
by the boom.
WeII, it hit me anyway.
It wouId have hurt a Iot Iess
if I had finished that Iast beer.
I'm sorry. I wiII try to tone it down
-And be nice?
-I'II be nice.
-You'II be topIess?

Which one was that?
The ones we had after

I'm okay.
Any more from the good batch?
Si<i>x</i>teen, peopIe, get out of the way!
Okay, Joey. You're doing reaIIy good.
I just need you

Remember taIking about the portside?
Oh, yeah.

Why not just say Ieft?
Okay, go to the Ieft.

You're yeIIing again. See that?
I'm gonna have a beer on the portside.

You just said a bunch

Did you see it? It was gross.
I did not see the bird or the fish!
I did not see the piece of
Styrofoam shaped Iike Mike Tyson!
I did not, because I was trying

Which obviousIy is

It wouId make my grandmother happy...
...that we're trying

Looking up?
She was reaIIy nice to me,
but she's in heII for sure.
WeII, I've tried everything.
I give up.
I'm not gonna be the mom...
...who makes the worId's
duck confit with broccoIi raab.
Kids Iove that, right?
Isn't there any reIative
that has the recipe?
What about your sister?
No. I made a promise to

That's the day you're gonna die?
I've got shuffIeboard that day.
That's what you think.
What about friends of your grandma?
WouIdn't they have the recipe?
I may have reIatives in France
who wouId know.
My grandmother said she got it from
the French Ianguage.
Phoebe, is this the recipe?
Yes!
Oh.
I cannot beIieve that I spent...
...two days figuring out that recipe.
It was here the whoIe time!

-Yep.
whiIe I taIk to this woman...

-Sure.
-Okay.
I did divert her, and we ended up

Look, KyIe just toId me

-Like what?
-Like she's reaIIy mean...
...and she's overIy criticaI and--
She wiII paint a room a reaIIy bright

-You're stiII gonna go out with her?
-Yeah.
WeII, didn't you hear

Pheebs, come on.

Listen to me, she is crazy!
Your door isn't soundproof.
You see? Nothing is good enough
for her.
-E<i>x</i>cuse me.
-He's not here!
My God, do you peopIe have
and just gawk at my assistant.
I'm EmiIy from upstairs.
Susan's stiII in the hospitaI, and I'm
coIIecting money to send her fIowers.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Okay. Yes, of course.
Just take it aII. Take it aII.
-Hi, Tag.
-Did you have fun with Joey Iast night?
-Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.
That's nice.
Then we went to a bar, and he
hooked us up with aII these women.
Women? You mean, Iike oId women?
Kind of oId, Iike .
I never used to be abIe
Iast night.
That's great.
Joey must have reaIIy taught
you some stuff.
A IittIe.
How you doing?
See? That's a great smiIe.
Easy, naturaI.
Now pretend I have a camera.
-You're changing it.
when I take résumé shots?
Borrow money from me?
Yeah. Okay, first of aII,
you want to make it Iook spontaneous.
So here's what I do. I Iook down,
Iook down, keep Iooking down.
Then I Iook up.
See? Now you try.
Look down. You're Iooking down.
with Tag Iast night.
Yeah, that guy's aII right.
Yeah, and you had fun teaching him
how to be aII ''Joey.''
-What?
-You know, aII the women.
You can't teach someone
any Iuck with ChandIer.
I'm right here.
WouId you mind just not
going out with him again?
Just the idea of you, and he,
and aII these women--
I know he's my assistant,
away from me.
I got a great partner to pick
up girIs with. FinaIIy!
I'm stiII right here.
WiII you at Ieast taIk to him...
...and teII him how hoIIow and unsatisfying
this dating-tons-of-women thing is?
What?
I just don't want him to meet anybody
It's just physicaI.
I get crushes Iike this aII the time.
I had a crush on you at first.
I know. Monica toId me.
Did you have a crush on me
when we first met?
Yeah, sure.
Can you peopIe not see me?
WiII you taIk to him?
-I don't know, Rach.
You can't take that back.
You wanted to taIk to me?
I don't know.
You got something for me?
Yeah, this is from RacheI.
Ten. Okay.
Tag, there's such a thing
as too many women.
-ReaIIy?
to get a big fan in here?
-Hey, there you are.
-There I am.
-You okay?
So he gave me an antihistamine.
What?
I feII asIeep on the subway
I know how to take a picture now.
Okay, see. Look down.
Look down.
Look down.
-ChandIer?
-Yeah?
-Hi.
-Hi.
How are things going with Crazy?
of the story. Okay?
FYI, she must have shown KyIe
over  paint sampIes...
...before she painted that room.
And his response to each one was,
''I don't give a tiny rat's ass.''
Maybe she shouId have spent
in the bedroom.
I don't think we are going
to have that probIem...
...but maybe that's just because I am not
emotionaIIy unavaiIabIe.
You think he's
home every night.
E<ix</icuse her for knowing
what she wants to do with her Iife.
WeII, she certainIy knew what
she was doing New Year's Eve,  .
I knew you were going
She apoIogized and apoIogized.
What more do you want?
We want the Iast si<ix</i years back!
So do we! So do we!
I'm sorry you had to see that.
-Morning, RacheI.
-Hi.
Hey, so, what'd you do Iast night?
-Went out with Joey.
-Yeah?
Another night of bird-dogging
that bar scene anymore.
Wow, I did not see that coming.
It's just not reaIIy who I am.
I've aIways been happier when--
Why am I teIIing you this?
-You don't care about this stuff.
-Yes, I do.
You were saying,
-ReaIIy?
Someone I can spoiI, you know.
SpoiI?
Let me ask you something.
Do you beIieve there's one perfect
person for everyone?
I'm starting to.
If that person's in your Iife,
shouId you do something about it?
Yes. HeII, yes.
AII right, then, it's settIed.
how's Whitney?
Maybe she wouIdn't have to be
seIfish in bed...
...if someone eIse knew where
everything was.
Oh, he knows.
For the most part.
Oh, hey.
-What's up?
WeII, I went over to KyIe's Iast night
to pick up a few things...
...and we got to reminiscing.
We taIked most of the night...
...and reaIized the reason
we're angry with each other...
...is because there are stiII
and her constant need for attention?
I'm gonna work on that.
Right, because you're so
capabIe of change.
You know, he hums when he pees.
-I do know.
-Makes him miss the bowI, but whatever.
We're so sorry.
That's aII right. We don't need you.
a tiny rat's ass.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
I'm sorry.
Pheebs, you were right about her.
You know, she did try to use
se<ix</i as a weapon.
Yeah, I hurt my back a IittIe.
You know, he hums whiIe he does
other stuff too.
We're better off without them.
Even if they break up again, you better
-Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.
You know, Pheebs, we don't taIk
that much anymore.
Yeah.
Hey, guys, check it out.
-My mom sent me the paper.
-Let's see it.
-Oh, yeah, that Iooks good.
-We reaIIy do.
Okay.
Imagine what our kids wouId Iook Iike.
We don't have to imagine.
I'm marrying her.
We'II just see.
[ENGLISH]
The reason I asked you to brunch...
...is because I've been thinking
about my maid of honor.
Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.
I hope it's you.
- I hope it's you.
- Me too.
First of all,
- Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?
I was thinking we could
come up with a system...
...where we trade off
being maid of honor.
- Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine...
be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.
We all get to do it
and no one gets upset.
- That's a pretty good idea.
- I'll do that. So, who's yours?
Well, that's the best part.
- I don't have to.
Of course we'll help you decide.
We'll do anything we can to help you.
I'd like to make a toast.
To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing...
...my best friend and truly one
of the nicest people that...
- Really not deciding.
I couldn't help overhearing.
- You're marrying Chandler Bing?
- Yeah.
Good luck!
Oh, and good luck to you too!
What a nice lady.
The One With Nap Partners
Yeah!
- Die Hard, still great.
- Yep.
Let's make it a double feature?
What else you rent?
Die Hard .
Joey, this is Die Hard  again.
Well, we'll watch it a second time
- And?
It would be cool to see it again!
- Yeah! Die Hard!
- Die Hard!
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I just got plans.
Well, John McClane had plans.
I want to leave before
Joey gets all worked up...
...and starts calling
- Yeah?
When I get married,
will you be my maid of honor?
Really?
Oh, my God, Phoebe.
I mean, I'm just...
Wait a minute.
If I'm your maid of honor,
I want to be Monica's.
- Why does it even matter?
- Why does it matter to you?
Because this one is now.
And it's two of our best friends.
And who knows what you're gonna marry.
What if I marry Ross? Or Joey?
You wouldn't.
Okay, look, Rachel.
I know you really want to do this...
...but I've never been
- Please let me finish.
I guess that was it.
Okay.
Since you've never done it before,
you can be Monica's maid of honor.
Oh, thank you so much!
Yay.
I'm gonna marry someone good.
Oh, I know.
Better than Chandler.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
We fell asleep. That is all.
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.
All right, well, I'd better go.
- I think that would be best.
- Okay.
- But not about this.
- No, never. Never!
- Bye.
- No touch. No touch.
Die Hard!
Opening a topless carwash
to open our bikini shop.
Now we mince the shallots like this.
Look, honey, the nice people
are chopping shallots.
Maybe if they chop enough of them,
they can open that bikini shot.
Hey, a weird thing happened at brunch.
This woman overheard that
"Good luck taming that wild stallion."
Not judging you, a little gay.
So, what did this woman look like?
She was, like, ,
dark hair, attractive.
Any chance you were looking into a
bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
Was it someone you dated in college?
No, I only dated two girls
- Well, let's see.
Okay, is that her?
Oh, my God, yes!
- Who is she?
- Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.
Did you break up with her?
No, we're still together.
We went out for two summers
and then I broke up with her.
- Why?
- I did not say fat.
I said fa...
You broke up with a girl
because she was fat?
Yeah. Yeah.
But it was a really long time ago.
Does she still feel bad?
Apparently she does.
You know what they say:
I'm gonna check out some male strippers.
For the bachelorette party?
Yes.
Hey, what's going on?
She's Monica's maid of honor.
Hope it goes better than the last time
you did it for that girl downstairs.
You have been maid of honor before?
You see? This is exactly why
you shouldn't lie.
That's it. I am maid of honor.
- No, I am.
who should do it.
We could have an audition.
See how you'd handle
maid-of-honor-type situations.
- What do you mean?
- When I want a job...
...I audition and if I'm the best
You go to the set.
You rehearse and you
have wardrobe fittings.
Then you shoot your part.
And it's great.
But right after that, you're back out
acting is the right choice for you two.
Joey, the maid of honor thing.
Right.
So, okay, so after this audition,
who decides who gets it?
Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.
- It's better than us deciding.
- Oh, this is crazy.
- Can't we just flip a coin?
We will let Ross and Joey decide.
Hi!
Ross, sweetie.
Hey there, handsome thing.
Wow, this cologne really is
every bit as good as Giorgio.
Hey.
Just brought back your videos.
Hey, Ross. Look, I think
we need to talk about before.
No. No, we don't.
Yes, we do.
Now, look.
you're talking about.
Come on, admit it.
That was the best nap you ever had.
I've had better.
Okay. When?
All right! All right!
It was the best nap ever!
I said it, okay?
But it's over, Joey!
I want to do it again.
We can't do it again.
- Why not?
- Because it's weird!
Fine.
You want a drink?
- Sure. What do you got?
- Who?
He was my best friend in fifth grade.
One day, I asked him to be
my boyfriend and he said no.
Do you know why?
Because you kept talking to him while
he was trying to go to the bathroom?
No, but because he thought
I feel as bad as I did then.
I really think you should
apologize to Julie.
Honey, are you kidding?
That was like  years ago.
It would make me feel better
this may make me a better person.
And that is not the man
you fell in love with.
- I can live with that.
- Okay.
- So how do we find her.
- I'll bet she was.
What is wrong with me?
Okay, we'll give you hypothetical
maid-of-honor situations.
You'll be scored
on a scale of one to ten.
- One being the highest.
- Because it's the highest.
Okay, Rachel, you're up first.
Situation number one
You're with Monica.
The wedding is about to start
when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
I don't want to marry Chandler.
- I've got cold feet.
I don't know.
This means I'll never
get to sleep with Joey.
Look, Monica...
...getting cold feet is very common.
It's just because
of all the anticipation.
And you just have to remember
- Oh.
- Okay, Phoebe.
- Yes, Your Honor.
We're now in the ceremony.
Monica is about to say, "I do"...
...when her drunk uncle
starts yelling.
What do you do? Go!
When Monica was a little girl...
...I remember that...
Ow!
- Very good!
in the middle of the ceremony!
Hey, you want
a little taste of Pheebs?
Ladies, please. Please.
Okay, the next situation is for Rachel.
The wedding is about to start.
You walk into the back room and you
find Monica taking a nap with Ross.
I'll be Monica. Go!
No, no, no!
This situation is not sanctioned!
Now, we're moving on to the next one.
Okay.
It is time for you to give
- Okay, okay, okay.
Webster's Dictionary
defines marriage as...
Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks!
Okay, never mind. Forget it.
I met... I met Monica when we were
when he was ...
...although he seemed
like a -year-old.
Oh.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I've known them
separately and together.
To know them as a couple is to know
are about to embark upon together.
I can think of no two people
better prepared for the journey.
Wow.
- Great speech.
- Yeah, it really was.
Oh, thanks.
Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next.
and Chandler are getting married.
I remember talking
about this day with Rachel...
...while we were
showering together, naked.
And she's back in the game!
Julie. Hi.
Chandler Bing.
because of your weight.
That's why you broke up with me?
You didn't know that?
Well, I guess my work here is done.
Can I get you guys something to drink
while you tabulate?
Actually, the final
vote has been tallied.
- I'll take a cocoa.
you both performed very well, okay?
You should be proud.
And I'd also like to say, in this
competition, there are no losers.
Well, except Rachel. Damn it!
Really? I won.
- What?
- I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close.
- Well, then I demand a recount!
Your thing was so stupid anyway.
We're gonna flip a coin, all right?
Heads.
What? The coins have
finally forgiven me!
Know what? I hope Monica
forgives you after you throw her...
...vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y
You guys are the best!
Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff
took a lot out of me.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Thinking about maybe going upstairs
I actually enjoyed myself.
I think that I'm going to apologize
for all the stupid things that I do.
Why don't you just stop
doing stupid things?
- Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
if I get fat?
What?
You broke up with Julie.
How much weight did she gain?
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
In one year?
My God, what did she eat?
Her family?
That's not the point.
I know it was a stupid reason to
the only time this was an issue.
You remember when you spent
Thanksgiving with us?
You called me fat.
Wait a minute.
- That was totally different.
- How?
You were not supposed to hear that.
I'm gonna look different.
I'm okay with that,
but I'm not sure you are.
You have to realize I don't think
of you as a thin, beautiful woman.
This is one of the things that
or you can shrink down...
...and I will still love you.
Even if I were to shrink down
to  inches tall?
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
I love you.
Skidmark still got a way
with the ladies.
Hi, Pheebs.
- Hi.
Rachel, we were all babies once.
Oh, you mean today. Yeah.
Yeah, and you know,
you deserve to win.
And I was thinking about it.
If you're Monica's maid of honor,
I get to be yours.
- Oh, yeah.
I put some stuff together.
- Just in case.
- Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.
Here is a book of poetry
that I know Monica loves.
Oh, God, this is funny. Look.
Here's a picture from one Halloween
because I was Wonder Woman.
Oh, and here's
a little purse that I found.
I just thought they could hold
the rings in there.
- Oh.
because people cry at weddings.
I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
This stuff is great.
I forgot this was in here.
This was the garter
that I was saving for my wedding.
And I wanted it
to be Monica's "something borrowed."
And it's blue.
Rach, I think that you should be
- Because I think it means more to you.
But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.
It's fine.
I mean, this is something...
...that you've been thinking about
since you were, what, ?
No, I was .
- Hey!
We decided Rachel is
going to be your maid of honor.
Oh, that's great!
Oh, wow. Okay, we really
have to start planning.
I have really specific ideas.
We should meet four times a week.
Come to my place,
So excited!
Yeah, okay. You laugh now.
She's gonna be yours.
Great nap.
It really was.
What the hell are you doing?
God!
Excuse me.
﻿
-Morning.
-Hi.
How was your date?
-Pretty good.
-Oh, good.
My God. Sorry about that.
Okay, reaIIy good.

You're going to Ieave

What, are you kidding?
Just casuaIIy sIip it in, you know.
Lay the groundwork.
TeII her I'm a Ioner.
with the Iikes of me.
That's a Iot to remember.
Can't I teII her that you're a pig?
I'm gonna caII her Iater myseIf.
Honest.
ChandIer used to do it.
He'd make her pancakes.
He'd make e<ix</itras
and Ieave them for me.
I'm not teIIing her anything.
on those pancakes?
-Hi.
-Hi.
Sorry, but I couIdn't get
that Iock to work.
Yeah, Joey kind of disabIed it
-Hi.
I don't mean this to sound Iike high

WouId you Iike some pancakes?
The One With Ross's Library Book
-Come on. Why are we here?
-Okay, okay, take a guess.
The hot chicks?
Okay, okay, I was typing names
and guess what came up.
My doctoraI dissertation.
It's right down here in the biggest
Iibrary in the university.
Wow, that's actuaIIy pretty cooI.
There's aIso a book here
by a woman named Wendy Bagina.
What is that?
Sounds Iike two peopIe are reaIIy

She sent the chicken back again?
She said it's too dry and wants

Funny story.

Good to see you again.
-Bye-bye.
teII her aII those things.
And we got to taIking, and I--
We want you to marry her.
What?
She is so amazing. You have no idea.
Who do you think brought her here?
Cupid.
She's so cooI.
She speaks four Ianguages.
Man, do you know what guys want.
Come on, she's so perfect for you.
She's sweet.
She Iikes basebaII.
but I don't see it going anywhere.
You aIways say that.
Maybe if you gave her a chance,
it wouId go somewhere.
I'm sorry, you guys.
I just don't think so.
-Whatever.
who keeps pigeons on the roof.
Phoebe!
Secret affair.
What did I say?
Hey, cutie-cutie.
So I ran into someone you know
today at work.
Oh, yeah? Who was it?
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry, sweetie.
Are you okay?
You didn't teII her we're engaged?
-She saw the ring.
-Did she freak out?
She was shocked,
to our wedding.
CIark too.
You said no, right?
You said no, right?
She cornered me. She asked me
if the wedding was in town.
-What was I supposed to do?
-Lie.
How hard is that?
Maybe it won't be so bad.
Think she'II sit <i>q</i>uietIy?
Think she'II want to make a toast?
You don't think she'II want
to sing ''Part-Time Lover''?
Oh, my God. She's not gonna Iike
want to come.
-ReaIIy?
-No, that was a Iie.
See how easy that was?
So you wouId have just Iied?
Yes.
-It wouId have reaIIy been that easy?
-Yes.
Do it Saturday. We're having
in front of my book.
I'm sorry?
My doctoraI dissertation is in the
Iibrary at schooI. I went to see it.
And there were students making babies
right in the paIeontoIogy section.
Oh, my God.
-I know that's not the point.
I'm trying to make it the point.
At your schooI...
...was there a pIace on campus
where students went to fooI around?
Yeah, there was.
In the corner of the Iibrary where aII
the books were that nobody ever read.
Yes, there was.
Great, because peopIe kept showing up.
-What's the rush?
I Iike to see the previews.
The candy.
-Oh, hey.
-WeII, Iook who's here.
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Erin.
-Hey, RacheI.
and see a movie.
-Oh, no!
-What's wrong?
Phoebe, we forgot that party
we have to go to.
Oh, no.
What party?
-A birthday party.
-AIison's birthday party.
And how oId is AIison?
-Thirty-two.
-Thirty-two.
-I feeI so terribIe ditching you Iike this.
-No, that's okay.
Wait a minute.
-Yeah, sure. That wiII be fun.
Guess I'II taIk to you guys
after AIison's party.
-That, actuaIIy, might go Iate.
-I'II wait up.
Do you know the paIeontoIogy section,
Just give me five minutes.
I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.
No, no, no.
Can I speak to someone in charge?
How can I heIp?
Hi, I was wondering, is it possibIe
to increase security...
...in the paIeontoIogy section?
I wrote a book that's up there.
And instead of reading it,
in front of it.
We are aware of the probIem
you're referring to.
As far as increasing security,
I'm afraid the Iibrary's understaffed.
I can't heIp you.
WeII, fine.
If I'm the onIy person
then I'II go defend it myseIf.
Don't you foIIow me.
-How did it go with Erin?
-UnbeIievabIe.
We had the best time.
-So you're not mad anymore?
-No, no. You guys were totaIIy right.
This was much better than
We were both nervous.
-Didn't you sIeep together?
-Yeah, that caIms me down.
And we have so much in common.
She Ioves sandwiches, sports.
AIthough she is a Met fan.
Not an issue now,
about having kids.
Oh, my Joey.
PIease don't get married before I do.
I just cannot beIieve
that CIark stood me up.
He may stiII show up.
What are you, stupid?
-It's been three hours.
-Is that aII?
I just feeI Iike such a fooI.
Oh, Iet's forget about CIark.
Let's go on to happier things.
Why don't you teII me
about your IoveIy wedding.
There was something that we wanted
to teII you about the wedding.
It's going to be a smaII ceremony.
Tiny.
We're not even sure
and be honest.
Do you want me to sing
''CareIess Whisper'' or ''Lady in Red''?
How can you say that?
The Mets have no cIoser.
-What about Benitez?
-You shut up.
I Iove arguing with her.
-Be right back.
-Okay.
So how's the second-greatest
Iove affair of the century?
Second? Who's the first?
Me and this muffin. My God, it's deIicious.
How's it going with Joey?
Oh, okay.
Okay?
TeII me that you Iike him, pIease.
you reaIIy want this to work out...
...but I just don't see this
having a future.
But you said that you Iiked him.
What happened?
Did you just change your mind?
-Kind of.
It's just, there's no reaI spark.
Didn't you sIeep together?
Yeah.
Tramp.
Does Joey have any idea?
I don't think he does.
You know what?
Maybe you couId teII him
I'm not interested...
...in a serious reIationship.
You mean, Iike,
-I'm sorry?
I guess ItaIian isn't one
of the four Ianguages you speak.
-Hey. Want to go?
-Yeah, Iet's go.
-Okay. See you guys Iater.
that brought her here.
No, just a reguIar oId fIying dwarf.
Yes, yes? How can I heIp you?
We were just Iooking around.
Oh, you're feIIow schoIars.
What e<ix</iactIy were you Iooking for?
Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's
musings...
...on the SmiIodon caIifornicus?
Get out of here!
Meeting someone?
Or are you just here to brush up...
...on Merriam's views on evoIution?
ActuaIIy, I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.
I find Merriam's views
It's a....
Wait.
Did you write this?
Yes.
You're the person
who checked out my book?
You know, you Iook nothing
Iike I wouId have thought.
You're so young.
WeII, I skipped fourth grade.
I am very, very sorry.
-So how was your date?
SpIit a miIk shake.
Seventy-thirty, but stiII.
I'm thinking of taking her upstate
to one of those bed and breakfasts.
ReaIIy? She said she wants to go?
No, it's a surprise. It's gonna be tricky
because she's busy at work.
-She said that?
it's kind of <iq</iuick...
...for you to be going away together
on a trip?
Not for me. No, I want to spend
as much time with her as I can.
Okay, honey.
for a serious reIationship.
-Where are you getting this?
-She toId me.
She said she's kind of a Ioner.
-Joey--
-Hey, Rach, it's cooI, you know.
I'm a Ioner too, right?
Hey, Joey. You know what?
you're not Iooking for a reIationship.
No, don't do that. Just....
-Ne<ix</it time, make sure she Iikes me.
-WeII, that too.
Joey?
-Do you want some pancakes?
-FinaIIy.
What are we gonna do?
I say we go with ''CareIess Whisper.''
ChandIer?
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Janice, what are you doing here?
I thought I was gonna go back
couIdn't be aIone tonight.
I was just wondering if I couId maybe
stay here with you.
Just, I reaIIy feeI Iike I need
to be with famiIy.
Our kids are gonna caII her
I reaIIy don't know what I might do.
Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?
-Do you have any tissues?
-Yeah, in the bathroom.
We'II just Iet her stay.
No. If we Iet her stay,
she wiII stay forever.
-Kind of Iike your BarcaIounger.
-Nothing. We'II just have to Iet her stay.
We can't. We gotta fight!
Fight!
ChandIer, she has beaten me.
I'm tired, ChandIer.
So very tired!
Hey, you guys?
Do either one of you want to get
in there before I take my bath?
Janice, I'm sorry...
...but you can't stay here tonight.
Why not?
HonestIy?
Our apartment is a hotbed...
...for eIectromagnetic activity.
Monica and I have been immunized,
but sadIy...
...you have not.
I'm gonna need a comforter.
Do you have a hypoaIIergenic one?
Because it's aIready happening.
Do you hear that? Listen.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You have to go.
Why?
Because ChandIer stiII has
feeIings for you.
He does?
Say again?
That's right. That's right.
And that is why you can't
to the wedding.
FeeIings. Such strong feeIings.
I mean, I reaIize that his feeIings
may never compIeteIy go away...
...but you can.
Oh, my God.
I understand. I am so sorry.
I'II go.
Goodbye, Monica.
I wish you a Iifetime
of happiness with him.
ChandIer.
You caII me when this goes
to shine in peopIe's eye--
Okay, see you Iater.
I just wanted
to show Monica your book.
[ENGLISH]
-Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.
-No, no, no.
What are we keeping Thanksgiving
I Iearned.
You have to name aII the states
in si<i>x</i> minutes.
What? That's Iike insaneIy easy.
It's harder than it sounds.
You aIways forget one.
Or, in some cases,  .
It's stupid and I wasn't pIaying against
so I decided to Iist the types of ceIery.
And I have one, reguIar ceIery.
So RacheI's got ,
and Phoebe has the Iead in...
...vegetabIes. Joey?
Say heIIo to the new champ
of ChandIer's dumb states game.
-Wow, how many you got?
one e<ix</itra pIace setting?
You invited your assistant.
Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming.
His girIfriend came into town,
so he's with her.
Why didn't you teII me?
I made him his own individuaI
sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
I was going to,
and perfect...
...you can never have too many
of those pumpkin things.
You'd think I wouIdn't enjoy that
because it is so fake, but I stiII do.
ReguIar ceIery!
I aIready have that.
Done...
...with time to spare.
-This may be a new worId's record.
a group of weII-educated aduIts...
...and Joey, can't name aII the states.
You ever see a map, or one of those
round, coIorfuI things caIIed a ''gIobe''?
MageIIan? You got  states.
-What? That's impossibIe.
WeII, who's weII-educated now,
Do not Iet Joey eat any of the food.
I am onIy one man.
-Okay, time is up.
-Now, just give me another minute.
If you don't know them by now,
you wiII never know them, okay?
That is the beauty of this game.
aII  before dinner.
Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.
You're on.
Don't Iook at my Iist, because there's
a Iot on there that you don't have.
Did you know your oven doesn't work?
The drawer fuII of takeout
menus is okay, right?
Ross, I'm gonna use yours.
ChandIer, give me a hand.
Joey, do not Iet Ross Iook at maps
It's not a gIobe of the United States.
I'm gonna go out and take a waIk.
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
-Oh, it's not.
-SeriousIy, it's moving.
-What the heII's in there?
-It's just my knitting. That's aII.
Yes, I knit this.
I'm very good.
Ross' apartment is nice.
-Which smeIIs deIicious.
-Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
-What?
We Ieft Joey aIone with the food.
Yep, yep, I knew it.
There he is...
...feeding stuffing to a dog!
Hi, GeIIer-Bing residence.
How can I heIp?
Why is a dog in our apartment?
I'm sorry, who's this?
There's a dog sitting on my couch.
TeII her I'm aIIergic, and I wiII sue!
-There's no dog here.
<i>and licking her hand.</i>
Oh, my God! Where are you?
I'II be right there.
They're here aIready?
How are they doing this?!
Hi, Tag.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see if your offer
to your girIfriend?
We kind of broke up this morning.
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
Ohio, thank you.
Where's the dog?
What dog? There's no dog here.
Yeah, that dog Ieft.
Wait a minute. I thought we agreed to say--
Your thing. Yeah.
Phoebe. Phoebe, open up.
There's no dog in here.
WeII, the hiding-the-dog pIan
who went out of town.
Wait.
HeIIo, my name is KIunkers.
May I pIease stay
with you nice peopIe?
I wish he couId stay here,
but ChandIer's aIIergic.
If I'm anywhere near a dog
Iiving here for the past three days.
ReaIIy?
If he's been here
that Iong...
...and you haven't had a reaction, maybe
you're not aIIergic to it.
It stiII has to go, right?
Why?
-Okay, it's--
-I have to.
Okay? It's time.
Okay, I hate dogs.
-What?!
-That's crazy? Why?
ToId you.
They are needy...
...jumpy, and you can't teII
what they are thinking...
...and that scares me a IittIe bit.
You're right. They are scary.
She just ate a treat out of my hand!
So you're not aIIergic? I mean, does that
a pink turtIeneck sweater.
The guy in the cataIog puIIed it off.
Wait. Do you not Iike aII dogs?
I mean, not even puppies?
Is there a puppy here?
-You don't Iike puppies?
-Okay, you are new.
Look, ChandIer, I toId you. Never
teII anyone about this dog thing.
It's Iike Ross not Iiking ice cream.
-You don't Iike ice cream?
a IittIe uncomfortabIe.
Hurts my teeth.
And I don't want you guys
to hate me...
...but I don't think I can be around
that dog anymore, okay?
So either the dog goes or I go.
Oh, my God!
How can I not get this?
I'm a coIIege professor.
can I ask you a <iq</iuestion?
When a guy breaks up
with his girIfriend...
...what is an appropriate amount
of time to wait before you make a move?
I'd say about a month.
ReaIIy? I'd say three to four.
HaIf-hour.
Interesting.
When it's your assistant,
does he Iike you?
Because if he doesn't Iike you,
this is aII a moo point.
A ''moo'' point?
Yeah. It's Iike a cow's opinion.
It just doesn't matter.
It's ''moo.''
Have I been Iiving with him
for too Iong, or did that aII just make sense?
Don't Iisten to Joey.
Okay, wouId you Iook at him?
He's obviousIy depressed.
for you to be his friend.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Thank you.
-Okay, that's what I'm going to do.
-Fine, take their advice.
No one ever Iistens to me.
When the package is this pretty,
-Okay.
-Come on.
-Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
I couId puII this off, right?
-Hey.
-Hey.
How you hoIding up?
Not bad.
-I'm sorry about your girIfriend.
-A year, on and off.
I kind of thought we'd end up together.
I don't anymore.
-Now that she broke up with you.
-Yeah.
It's weird.
I used to assume that I wouId meet
LateIy, it's Iike, what if it's not?
Do you ever have that feeIing?
No.
Yeah.
AII the time.
ConstantIy. It's terrifying.
But, you know, then I figure,
it has to work out.
Why?
Because it has to.
-You reaIIy have aII the answers, don't you?
-Come on, what are bosses for?
Hug it out.
AII right, he Iikes you back.
ToId you, you shouId go for it.
What?
Street noise drown any of that out?
No? See you Iater.
Okay.
What did Joey say? I Iike you back?
You know-- WeII, see-- He--
Joey knows that I'm very insecure
about my back.
And you were hugging me...
...so, obviousIy, you are not
repuIsed by it. Yeah!
-Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
crazy because we work together...
...and nothing couId ever happen.
The Iast thing I wanted to do
was freak you out...
...or make you feeI uncomfortabIe.
Which is why it wouId be reaIIy great
if you said something right about now.
Oh, my God.
-Okay, that's gonna take one minute.
Do you have anything eIse
you want to get off your chest?
I can't beIieve this.
We stiII have time to taIk,
and they're not even in the car yet.
Look, there they go.
Okay, Phoebe.
I'II be IoneIy.
Stop it. Stop.
-Okay, Iet's go. We can be strong.
-Yeah, okay.
Did you hear that?
She said, ''Monica.''
I can't Ieave her.
We couId sneak the dog back in,
and ChandIer had no idea.
He's not so smart.
Hey. I didn't know either.
Yeah, but you kind of knew that
something was going on, didn't you?
Yeah, I knew.
Where's ChandIer?
-Here I am.
-Wash your hands.
How did you know?
Hey, what's she doing back here?
I Iaid out the states geographicaIIy.
We don't have time for this.
We have to keep him away from my room.
-Yeah, but, Iook what--
-This is what we do not have time for!
-Where's Monica?
about this whoIe KIunkers thing.
-WeII, I shouId go in there.
-No, no.
No, she doesn't want to see
you right now.
-Why not?
-Oh, is it? Is it?!
Look, when Monica and I were kids,
we had a dog named Rover.
And one day, my dad decides
he doesn't Iike dogs.
So Monica and her friend PhyIIis...
...take away the dog, and that was the
-Monica's upset because of KIunkers.
So? Bring the dog back.
You're a hero.
Yeah, I couId be a hero.
I couId do that.
What if it attacks me?
ChandIer, it's Iike a big gerbiI.
And that doesn't scare you?
Ross, you need some heIp?
From you?
Yes, pIease.
First of aII, Utah?
Dude, you can't just make stuff up.
Okay, KIunkers,
I am not going to do that voice.
KIunkers.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Come back here,
you furry, IittIe butt-sniffer.
Not you, ma'am.
I hate America!
When I finish this game,
I swear, I am moving.
-Tag stiII taIking to the poIice?
I'm attracted to you.''
I know that I freaked him out.
If you said it Iike that, you did.
What was I thinking?
I work with this man.
I have to see him every day.
How'd this happen to me?
Oh, wait. That's right,
it was because of you.
AII right, I think I can heIp you.
-Okay, okay, okay.
Now, you're gonna want to taIk
to him about this, right?
But trust me, Rach,
that'II onIy make it worse.
You have to deny everything.
That conversation out there,
It was a pretty Iong conversation.
There was no conversation.
Okay. Joey, I'm just gonna taIk to Tag.
Who's ''Tag''? There's no ''Tag'' .
Okay. This conversation is over.
See? It works.
Hey, is ChandIer here?
No, he went for a waIk.
Okay, you cannot teII him,
but Iook who's back.
WeII, no, no, no.
He went over to Ross' to bring
the dog back here.
Oh, no, the dog's not going
don't be mad at me.
-What? Why wouId--?
-Wait and see.
Maybe we wiII, maybe we won't.
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment
to bring back KIunkers for you...
...and I Ieft the door open,
the apartment, incIuding the roof.
Which, FYI, Ross,
one of your neighbors, growing weed.
I couIdn't find him...
...and I am so, so, so sorry.
But I do know where we can aII go
ease the pain.
We have good news. Look who's back!
KIunkers. Oh, my God!
-She came back aII by herseIf.
from Ross' buiIding.
The things she must've seen.
She cIimbed up the fire escape...
...and she tapped on the window with her
teeny, IittIe paw, and we ran to Iet her in.
I went too far, didn't I?
When shouId I have stopped?
Okay, maybe this is so hard
because there aren't  states.
Let me teII you something.
to eat something.
It's up to you.
-Oh, hi. How are you doing?
-I'm okay.
I gotta go down to the poIice station
and Iook at mug shots.
Thanks for having me over.
Tag, you're going?
We didn't even get a chance to taIk.
So where did you say
-What good are you?
Look, I think we shouId taIk
about what happened on the terrace.
Okay.
I never shouId've said what I said.
It just doesn't matter how I feeI.
We work together, so nothing couId
reaIIy ever happen between us.
I wouId Iove to go to work on Monday
Lots to do.
So we okay?
I'm not.
I knew it.
I freaked you out.
No, you didn't.
What freaked me out was you saying
nothing couId happen between us.
-ReaIIy?
for doing this.
That's one Iess thing
we have to do on Monday.
DeIaware.
DeIaware.
-AII right.
-I want my turkey now.
You got it.
You got Nevada twice.
-I know.
﻿
-You sure?
Let me just straighten out
your heImet there.
-Thanks, Daddy.
-No, no. One daddy, two mommies.
-AII right, it's aII yours.
This is so e<i>x</i>citing!
Oh, yeah, I remember mine.
It was my si<i>x</i>th birthday.
I went to the park...
-...and I got on it, and it bent.
-Yeah.
-I never had a bike of my own.
had the best bike.
It was pink, and it had rainbow-coIored
tasseIs hanging off the handIes...
...and a beII
and this big, white wicker basket...
...with those
-No.
But she gave me the bo<i>x</i>
that it came in.
It had a picture of the bike
on the front.
So I wouId sit on it, and my stepdad
to drag him around too.
The One With AII the Candy
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Making candy for the neighbors.
I'm sorry, who?
I'm gonna hang
a basket on the door.
When the neighbors waIk by,
they can take a piece.
-But we don't know the neighbors.
the guy with the mustache...
...smokes-a-Iot Iady,
some kids I've seen...
...and a red-haired guy
who does not Iike to be caIIed Rusty.
Oh, I know that guy.
I'm making this candy.
We can get to know our neighbors.
WouIdn't it be easier
if we just moved?
Good morning!
-Somebody's in a good mood.
-WeII, why shouIdn't I be?
I have great friends.
with your assistant.
It's not a big deaI.
We stayed up aII night creating a pIan
so that us dating won't be a probIem.
Oh, yeah? What's the pIan?
We-- We are not...
...going to Iet it...
...be a probIem.
It took you aII night
to come up with that pIan?
WeII, you know,
on the first date.
-Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise--
-Anymore!
Hi, Tag, I have a conference caII
today, is that correct?
-Yes, at .
He had no idea...
...there was something
going on between us.
-I'd better get back to my desk.
-Okay, hard worker.
I'II put that in your evaIuation.
-My what?
a performance evaIuation.
But you know, there is one thing
that I have yet to evaIuate.
-Are you serious?
-No, I've just aIways wanted to do that.
Can you heIp me cIean this up?
-Thanks.
The basket is totaIIy empty!
The neighbors ate it aII!
WeII, either that or....
No. Not even Joey couId eat that much.
LittIe refresher, popcorn shrimp night.
Joey!
Yeah?
-Did you eat aII the neighbor candy?
-That was the pIan.
When I got to it,
They Iove it.
They Iove my candy?
-Oh, man, I gotta go make more.
-Hey, Mon.
Make some more Iasagna too. Something
might have happened to a chunk of it.
Ross, the neighbors ate aII my candy.
Mine stoIe my newspaper.
It's Iike a crime wave.
Pheebs, you got a second?
Sure.
Ever since you toId me
a first bike, you know? So....
Oh, my God, Ross!
-You Iike it?
-I Iove it!
-Yeah?
-Oh, oh, God--
And I Iove you.
Not that way.
But the bike got you a Iot cIoser.
WeII, take it downstairs.
You know, give it a test drive.
Okay. Oh, my God.
My first bike!
Thank you for the best present
-Yeah, you are.
Who is that?
Don't worry, I'm brave.
I-- I am brave.
No, no, no, no!
Can you teII me who is there, pIease?
My name's Gary. I Iive upstairs.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Do you know what time it is?
-It's candy time.
My roommate says they taste
''LittIe drops of heaven.''
Four a.m.
So can I get some candy?
I am sorry, but some of us
have to get up earIy and go to work.
He does not know
that I am not ''some of us.''
-He can hear me, can't he?
in the morning.
Okay, I'II swing by Iater.
You Iive in this buiIding?
Seems Iike I'd remember you.
Night, Gar.
Is there anybody in this buiIding
that does not hit on you?
Smokes-a-Iot Iady.
Oh, wait, that is not true.
So did you read your evaIuation yet?
No, it was marked ''confidentiaI.''
I just sent it to human resources.
PIease, you're kidding, right?
I wrote that one as a joke for you.
A joke they wouId appreciate?
I'm thinking, no.
-What did you say?
teeny, tiny tushy.
No, not my tushy.
It gets worse.
About your initiative, I wrote
''He was abIe to unhook my bra
with minimaI supervision.''
Under probIems with performance,
I wrote, ''Dear God, I hope not.''
And then-- And then I drew
to get Phoebe that bike.
When I heard the story,
I aImost cried.
AImost cried, huh?
Hear that, ChandIer? ''AImost'' cried.
Hey, you cry every time
Those two had onIy each other.
She reaIIy Iikes it, huh?
Oh, yeah. I saw her
It was so cute.
I saw her this morning,
waIking it by the park.
Wait, she was waIking the bike?
Both times?
-Hey, Pheebs.
-Oh, hi!
-Hey, so you enjoying the bike?
to ride a bike, don't you?
Of course.
Can we see you ride it?
Okay.
See?
I toId you not to get
invoIved with your assistant.
There's no such thing as a secret
when it comes to affairs.
Did you hear that, ChandIer?
No such thing.
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Maybe it's not that bad. They might
Because ''tushy'' can mean both ass...
...and good worker.
I just gotta get the thing back.
Rach? That sketch you mentioned?
Might it have Iooked
a IittIe Iike this?
Oh, my God, Joey!
-What is the matter with you?
-God!
This IittIe taIent came in handy
after-hours, but I reaIIy need candy.
I'm sorry, I can't heIp you.
See? RuIes are ruIes.
PIease, I have peopIe coming
from out of town today.
-I toId them aII about your candy.
What did you teII them?
I toId them your candy
was absoIuteIy indescribabIe.
Some peopIe have said it's ''IittIe
drops of heaven.'' But whatever.
-PIease, can't you heIp me out?
beIow you and has se<ix</i reaIIy Ioud?
AII right, I'II do it just this once.
-But you can't teII anyone.
-PIease, just give it to me.
Yeah, that's her.
-Thank you.
-UnbeIievabIe!
I can't beIieve that sign didn't work.
You know what wouId work?
so peopIe wouId Iike you?
You want to taIk about getting
peopIe to Iike you, huh, funny man?
Just remember everything
I taught you, and you'II be fine.
Okay? Here we go.
Ready, set--
Wait, this seat
we shouId just get another one.
Perhaps Iike an airpIane seat,
or a beanbag chair!
You can't get out of this.
You have to Iearn how to ride a bike.
Why? Why do I have to Iearn?
-WeII, in case of an emergency.
and puts a gun to your head and says
''You ride this bike or I'II--
I'II shoot you.''
I wouId ring the beII to distract him.
Then I wouId knock the gun away
with a Chinese throwing star.
Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...
...and, hey, I'II hoId you up
and push you. Okay?
You won't Iet go?
-No.
-Come on.
AII right, here we go. AII right?
-AII right.
-AII right?
FeeI good?
AII right, try pedaIing.
That's it, you're doing great.
-I am shocked. Shocked!
It's a Iegitimate Iearning techni<iq</iue.
Wow.
Hey, there's some peopIe outside
asking about candy.
They'II just have to wait, won't they?
I onIy got two hands!
-Need some heIp?
with the system!
By the way, the week before your
wedding, you may not see a Iot of me.
Oh, heIIo, Iiar.
Look, I'm reaIIy sorry
I Iet go of the bike.
I couId've been kiIIed, you know.
I know, I know.
But can we pIease try it again?
I mean, you were so cIose, Phoebe.
WeII, I wouId Iove to...
...but the bike got stoIen
-What?
What the heII?
You know what?
If you won't Iearn how to ride,
then I'm sorry...
-...I have to take it back.
-What? Why?
Because it's....
It'd be Iike you having this guitar...
...and never pIaying it.
Okay, this guitar wants to be pIayed.
And this bike wants to be ridden.
And if you don't ride it...
...you're kiIIing its spirit.
The bike...
...is dying.
AII right. If you care enough
before they see it...
...we gotta get into ZeIner's office.
He doesn't get in untiI  .

WhiIe I distract her, you go in.
-Got it.
-Let's roII.
HeIIo, RacheI. You got a minute?
Yeah, sure, Mr. ZeIner.
For you? Anything. Minute.
Okay, great.
Abort the pIan.
ActuaIIy, I'd Iike to speak

No, thanks,
but I'II give these to Betty.
So I read your evaIuation of Tag.
Or to use his fuII name,
Tag ''Sweet Cheeks'' Jones?
Is something going on with you two?
Oh, my God,

And your future at the company
wouId be in jeopardy.
-WeII--
-Mr. ZeIner....
I fiIIed in that evaIuation.
-Oh, no--

It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.
What is this drawing?
I can't figure it out.
It's upside down, you gotta--

Waiting to get candy.
Get in here.
Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.
Merry Christmas.
The candy is coming! I need

What is the matter with you peopIe?
This woman was trying to do a nice
She's got dark circIes under her eyes...
...chocoIate on her face,

She was making candy

﻿
Bye-bye.
I just got us reservations
to ceIebrate...
...our first hoIiday season
as a betrothed coupIe.
-''Betrothed.''
-Betrothed coupIe.
-Hey!
every Christmas...
...to remind us that even though
it's Christmas, peopIe stiII die.
And you can put candy in it.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Licorice?
Sure.
-I get Ben for the hoIidays this year.
-Nope.
I mean,
I know Susan does every year...
...but I want to take this year
to teach him about Hanukkah.
And maybe I couId teach Ben...
...about the Christmas skuII
to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Hey.
-Did you know he was in there?
-No.
-How Iong have we been home?
-About haIf an hour.
LoveIy.
The One With The HoIiday ArmadiIIo
You know what I was thinking?
My apartment's gonna be ready soon.
So I guess I'II be moving out.
Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.
Yes, you wiII be very sad.
-I gotta go teII RacheI the good news.
-You guys are gonna Iive together again?
-Yeah, why not?
-She's just having so much fun with Joey...
...I just assumed she'd stiII
so much fun Iiving with Joey?
No reason, e<i>x</i>cept she...
...toId me.
ReaIIy? She said she didn't want
to Iive with me?
No. No, she didn't say that.
I think you shouId taIk to Monica now.
Phoebe, don't worry. I'm sure
she wants to Iive with you.
You're sure?
Yeah, yeah.
''Oh, your mom
probabIy won't kiII herseIf.''
You know, ''No, the funeraI director
probabIy won't hit on you.''
''Yeah, that nice coupIe probabIy
but I'm not hanging aII my hopes...
...of RacheI and I Iiving together
on ''probabIy.''
You gotta take care of yourseIf
in this worId.
History teaches us nothing.
''Bing'' doesn't seem so weird now,
for Christmas.
-Drums?
-No, drums!
Hi, couId we get
two burritos to go, pIease?
I'm sorry. But not that sorry,
the name ChandIer Bing.
Okay, we'II have a tabIe for you
in about  minutes.
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets
I'm sorry.
-Give him money? It was a joke!
No. To get a tabIe. PIaces Iike this
are aIways shaking you down.
-Everybody wants a payoff.
-AII right, caIm down, O'MaIIey.
-I'II sIip him some money.
so if you couId get us a tabIe...
...a IittIe <iq</iuicker, I'd appreciate it.
-Of course, sir.
-Okay.
-How'd it go?
-Had the money in the wrong hand.
Hey. You don't feeI...
-...Iike you're gonna throw up, do you?
don't you?
Christmas.
Yeah, and you know what
other hoIiday is coming up?
Christmas Eve.
Yes, but aIso....
Hanukkah!
See, you're part Jewish,
and Hanukkah is a Jewish hoIiday.
Santa has reindeers that can fIy.
Right, but on Hanukkah--
Hanukkah is a ceIebration
these peopIe caIIed the Maccabees.
Okay, that's right. Yes...
...but on Hanukkah, we sing
Okay, it's not a contest.
When is Santa coming?
How about this year,
instead of Santa...
...we have fun ceIebrating Hanukkah?
No Santa?
Was I bad?
No. Oh, no, no. Hey, you weren't bad.
You've been very good, Ben.
-Santa's mad at me.
-Then sure!
Maybe this sIipping-him-money thing
is not gonna work.
Maybe we shouId just wait.
You're the one who said you wouId die
I didn't say ''die.''
I said ''cry.''
It's easy. Just keep it casuaI.
Give him a kind word,
-I don't know.
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Mustached bastard.
Okay, those peopIe just Ieft. Come on.
Quick, give him the money.
E<i>x</i>cuse me.
We're in a bit of a hurry.
Can we...?
So you Iike the drums.
That's great.
You know, I was worried that
So, yay!
Hey, Pheebs,
we aIready Iearned a song.
Ready? One, two, three, four.
Te<iq</iuiIa!
That's fun.
Here you go.
Thank you, Gunther.
Put her there.
DefiniteIy not easier with coins.
-Thank you.
-Hey.
Here. Now I onIy owe you ..
Hey, Pheebs...
...if you want to get Joey a Christmas
present that disrupts the entire buiIding...
...why not get him something more subtIe...
...Iike a wrecking baII...
...or a viaI of smaIIpo<i>x</i>
to reIease in the haIIway?
It's not just the drum noise.
in the air...
...and I have to hear
''Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!''
-I mean, it is so annoying.
-Yes, thank you.
You see, this is how normaI peopIe
to annoy RacheI...
...so she wouIdn't want
to Iive there anymore?
Maybe on some IeveI.
Joey, you know that you couId just
not throw the sticks up in the air.
What is rock 'n' roII about that?
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
HoId it!
What was I thinking...
...giving Joey this big, gross,
scary spider...
...in such a poorIy constructed cage?
What are you taIking about?
I Iove them.
I had a tarantuIa when I was a kid.
I feeI Iike it's on me. I got--
Oh, isn't that adorabIe?
Joey is afraid of the tarantuIa.
He's so adorabIe.
God, he's just so much fun.
Joey's the best.
I'm gIad you're having so much fun here.
Wait a minute.
What's the matter?
Our apartment is ready.
And that makes you angry because...?
Because you'd rather
Iive here with Joey.
-Where did you get that?
so much fun here...
...and apparentIy no amount of drums
or tarantuIa is gonna change that.
Phoebe,
did you get aII this stuff for Joey...
...to try and drive me out
gotten him a fish.
You know how fish freak me out.
Fish.
But it wouIdn't have mattered.
You and I are gonna Iive together.
We're roommates.
That's the deaI.
Yes, but I wanted you to want
so much fun over here--
It's so much more fun with you.
-We did have fun, didn't we?
-We had so much fun.
Remember the time we were pIaying
with the SuperBaII...
...and we accidentaIIy threw it through
but I don't remember how it broke.
Yeah, stuff Iike that.
WeII, anyway, they say, if we want,
we couId see it tonight.
-I wouId Iove to.
-Yay, okay!
-Good, good, good.
to make the drumming stop.
Done.
HeIIo, sir.
You here to return those pants?
No, these are my pants.
Okay.
-How can I heIp you?
-Do you have a Santa outfit Ieft?
Two days before Christmas?
-Yeah, I've tried everywhere.
-PIease, pIease. I mean, I'II pay e<i>x</i>tra.

What happened to Santa,
HoIiday ArmadiIIo?

Come in, have a seat.
You must be e<i>x</i>hausted,

Wow, thanks!
You're weIcome, Ben.
Merry Christmas.
And happy Hanukkah!
Are you for Hanukkah too?

You sent me here

Ho, ho, ho!

Thank you, but you gotta Ieave.

Did your dad ever dress up Iike Santa?

Oh, new sconces!
-Oh, my God!

Okay, remember how you toId me
-Yeah.
And that the IandIord

-Yeah?

-You can't, because of the new skyIight.
-There's a skyIight?
Wow!
So, what shouId we do?
ShouId we start Iooking for a new pIace?
You know, I'm sensing...
...that my grandmother

-A IittIe bit. Yeah.
-Yeah.
Pheebs, is your grandmother maybe saying

You heard it too? You have the gift.
Phoebe, it's okay.
I Iike Iiving with Joey.
-Are you sure?
Iiving with you.
-Oh, me too.
-I know.
Oh, wait. Did you hear that?
Listen. I'm getting something
from your grandmother.
She said that since you get to keep
the purpIe chair.
No, I do not hear that.
Oh, no, wait a minute. Oh, okay.
She didn't say ''chair,'' she said ''share.'' You
shouId share the one-bedroom apartment.
Oh, the purpIe chair.
No, yeah, I heard that.
And the miracIe was that
just one day, burned for....
-Eight whoIe days.
-That's right.
And that's why we ceIebrate
Hanukkah today. The end.
-Awesome.
fIew aII the Jews out of Egypt.
The armadiIIo was actuaIIy
not so thriIIed about that part.
Why is Santa kissing Aunt Monica?
Because Aunt Monica
was very, very good this year.
Okay, Ben, it's time to Iight...
...the Hanukkah candIes!
Hey.
Wow! Looks Iike the Easter Bunny's
We're Iighting the candIes.
I understand why Superman is here...
...but why is there a porcupine

-Did you get it?
-I got it.
Is it back in the cage?
It's back in the cage.
Is the cage cIosed?
Joey, wiII you just come out here
﻿
of a sweet tooth--
Oh, my God, it's so creamy!
That's the best
cheesecake I've ever had!
Where did you get this?
It was at the front door when I got
home. Somebody sent it to us.
This isn't addressed to you.
This is addressed
before I opened it...
...and you can't return a bo<i>x</i>
after you opened it!
-Why not?
-Because it's too deIicious!
You stoIe this cheesecake.
wiII send for a free one.
That way, we aII win.
The onIy Iosers are the
big cheesecake congIomerate...
...''Mama's LittIe Bakery.''
I feeI terribIe.
I'm a horribIe, horribIe person.
I'm sorry, what?
The One With AII The Cheesecakes
I shouId get going. Big day at work.
You know how I'm in a coma?
Today they do a test on me and it
turns out I'm not brain-dead.
So--
Mr. Smarty Pants.
It's just my character
-I'II see you at .
What's at ?
Dinner. We get together about once

Wow! Did not know that.

-What are you taIking about?

From the ages of  to ,
Frannie and I were inseparabIe.
Maybe since the age of ,
Frannie's made some new friends.
Do you wanna make some new friends?
It's probabIy just a mistake.
invitation got Iost in the maiI.
You caII her and teII her
that when we were kids...
...her precious Frannie
tried to undress me severaI times.
If I hadn't stopped her, there
are you home yet?
I think he's stiII out.
What's wrong?
I'II teII you, RacheI Karen Greene.
I had pIans with Joey,
and he Ieft me this note.
''Pheebs, can't make it.
-That's a nickname we were trying.
Why didn't you guys try ''Francis''?
Francis is a cooIer name than ChandIer,
isn't it?
You know what nickname
never caught on? ''The Ross-a-tron.''
Here's Joseph Francis!
Wait, what are you
right to ditch me!
You can canceI pIans with friends
if there's a possibiIity for se<ix</i.
He's right. That is the ruIe.
-ReaIIy?
-WeII, that's what I hear.
I've never gotten a chance
pIans, I e<i>x</i>pect you to show up.
I'm not a way to kiII time
tiII you meet someone better.
Boyfriends and girIfriends wiII
come and go, but this is for Iife.
I'm so sorry. I had no idea
I'II pay for myseIf.
Okay, you wore me down.
WhiIe you're over there, how
about a beer for ''The Ross-a-tron''?
''Ross--'' Is that back?
The other cheesecake came.
They deIivered it here again.
Just bring it downstairs.
What's the probIem?
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Are you serious?
We ate an entire cake
what it tastes Iike.
It was cheesecake. It was fine.
It had a buttery, crumbIy,
graham cracker crust...
...with a very rich...
...yet Iight cream cheese fiIIing.
Wow, my whoIe mouth
just fiIIed with saIiva.
Know what? Forget it.
We're just Iightheaded.
So Iet's go have Iunch
and forget about the cheesecake.
We'II drop it off
so we're not tempted.
-Where do you want to eat?
is over?
So I finaIIy heard back
from Aunt CheryI...
...and apparentIy it wasn't a mistake.
There's Iimited seating--
Limited seating? I am just
one tiny person!
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.
I mean, the Iast time she saw you...
...you'd have turned one of those
That's such a Iame e<i>x</i>cuse.
That's not the reason
she's not inviting me.
What's the big deaI? I wasn't invited
to the ceremony, just the reception.
If it makes you feeI any better, Joan
as a sign of protest.
-Joan?
-Yeah, my date.
Assistant professor in Iinguistics.
TaII, very beautifuI.
And despite what some peopIe say,
You got ''Ross GeIIer and Guest''?
I wasn't invited,
and you got ''and Guest''?
E<ix</icuse me, I do have to interrupt
on Ross' behaIf.
I think the ruIe appIies here.
Since he has a chance
-Did you not hear me?
She's an assistant professor
in the Iinguistics department.
They're wiId.
-Why do you want to come anyway?
-Because...
...she's my cousin.
I mean, we grew up together.
FamiIy, you know?
Happiest day of her Iife.
We'II see.
WeII, thank you for Iunch.
Wait, I thought you paid.
ApparentIy, we don't pay
for food anymore.
-Do you see what I see?
-It's stiII there.
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
She couId be out of town.
She can't come back to bad cheesecake.
-It couId kiII her.
-Don't want that.
We're protecting her.
-We'II take it.
-Why?
a white, Iacy dress to a wedding?
-Yes.
-E<i>x</i>ceIIent.
Oh, my God, that's David.
-Who?
-David, the scientist guy.
David that I was in Iove with.
Who went to Russia
they turn around.
Phoebe.
David.
What are you doing?
Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
I'm just in town for a conference.
God, you Iook phenomenaI.
WeII....
Yeah.
You Iook great too.
Did you get a haircut?
Yeah. WeII, I got Iike  of them.
Look, I got a confession to make.
I was hoping to run into you here.
I didn't know if I shouId caII.
on your Iife.
I reaIIy wanted to see you...
...but I didn't know
if you wanted to see me.
Of course I wouId want to see you.
I think about you aII the time.
ReaIIy? Because I think about you
that reminds me of you so much.
It's actuaIIy of Lenin...
...but, you know, at certain angIes....
Anyway, do you want
to have dinner tonight?
Yes.
Oh, no!
-What?
-I can't.
I can't beIieve I have pIans.
I have to be on the redeye.
Listen, ne<i>x</i>t time you're in Minsk....
Phoebe? Can I taIk to you
for a second?
What are you doing?
I have pIans with Joey.
So? He'II understand.
No, he won't.
And that's not even the point.
I made a whoIe speech about how
the Iove of my Iife...
...returns from Russia
for one night...
...I shouId change my beIiefs?
I shouId change my beIiefs!
No. If I don't have my principIes,
I don't have anything.
You're so strong.
Or I shouId rush through dinner
if I stop eating this...
...I'II regret it.
Hey, what have you got there?
Oh, it's....
It's tofu cake. Want some?
What are you doing tonight?
Dude. Dude.
Sorry.
I got pIans with Phoebe.
ReaIIy? Monica said

-What? Tonight?
-That's what Monica said.
After that speech, she makes a date on
on Big Daddy.
-Now, if you'II e<i>x</i>cuse me....
-Dude, dude!
If I took off my pants right now,
how wouId you feeI?
Like your cousin GIenn.
Here, I think this is us.
Limited seating, my ass.
Let's see who made the cut.
Hi. I'm Monica GeIIer.
-How do you know the bride and groom?
and I didn't get invited.
A bIood reIative. BIood.
Stop saying ''bIood'' to strangers.
From the ages of  to , we were
inseparabIe, and I didn't even get invited!
Then why are you here?
-I'm my brother's date.
-Hey, I had a date, okay?
Joan Tedeschi, the Iinguist.
So how about you?
she's very pIeasant.
There! There! Her back Iooks Iike that.
That's not broad, is it?
Come on, Joey, you've got to be ready
to order by now.
You know, I don't I Iike this tabIe
E<i>x</i>cuse me, we're ready to order.
I don't work here.
WeII, then you shouIdn't be
waIking around.
-Are you guys ready?
-Yes.
I'II have a green saIad,
the speciaIs again.
We've heard the speciaIs three times.
There's prime rib, mahi-mahi
and a very speciaI Iobster ravioIi.
-ActuaIIy, we're out of the ravioIi.
-WeII, that changes everything!
You know what, Pheebs?
-Is to have a Iong, Iong taIk.
You know? Get Joey out on the
open road and reaIIy open him up.
-Any progress?
-Yes.
I wiII have the Iobster ravioIi.
God, Joey, this is taking forever.
-What's the rush?
because you wouIdn't have a date...
...on the same night
you have pIans with a friend.
Don't make me feeI badIy.
No, I'm gonna!
You made me feeI reaIIy guiIty
about going out with that girI.
Like I did something terribIe.
Remember David, the scientist guy?
He's very speciaI to me.
My girI the other night was speciaI.
She was a scientist too.
-She was?
-WeII, she graduated high schooI.
Whatever. Know what?
He's onIy here for four
-Yeah.
What are you stiII doing here?
I toId you, Iobster ravioIi!
I was about to Ieave.
I didn't think you were coming.
I wouIdn't have missed this.
WeII, I'm very gIad you're here.
Oh, you're such a gentIeman.
Come on, we're going to my pIace.
Are you eating the cheesecake
to whistIe right now.
-How can you eat it without me?
-What'II you do?
TeII Monica or Joey?
No, you'd have to teII them everything.
We're dessert steaIers.
and I'm taking it back!
-What? Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.
You think I trust you with it?
No, we'II spIit it.
That's not fair. You had some.
I think Monica wouId be
very interested to know...
...that you caIIed her cheesecake
-It's the smaIIer piece.
Okay. There you go.
Enjoy your haIf, my friend.
But that is it.
No sharing, no switching,
and don't come crying to me...
...if you eat your piece too fast.
-You gonna give me some of yours?
And don't come crying to me.
I may just sit here
and have my cake aII day.
Just sit here in the haIIway
and eat my--
Ross, sweetheart!
Oh, hey, Aunt MiIIie.
-Isn't it a beautifuI wedding?
Won't she be happy to see me?
You be nice, aII right?
I didn't bring you to ambush her.
Frannie was the one
who showed your <i>Playboys</i> to Mom.
That bitch.
Monica!
What--?
Am I doing here?
Surprised to see me?
Ross brought me.
and not me? Why?
Why wouIdn't you want me here?
What couId I have done?
Stuart!
I beIieve you know my husband.
So it's reaIIy a <i>q</i>uestion
of ''who'' couId you have done.
I hate this, but I have to go.
I can't miss my fIight.
I bet there's
What does it mean?
''PIease cIean my beakers.''
I don't get out of the Iab much.
I thought it meant something eIse.
Yeah, weII, I reaIIy actuaIIy
wanted to say...
...that.
But I figured I probabIy shouIdn't
because...
...I have to Ieave.
No, you're right. Don't say it.
I do, though.

Oh, Pheebs, we just actuaIIy

<iArmageddon</i is what's going

Sorry, I just can't sIeep.
Where's that book you're reading

Because every time I Iook

It's in the Iiving room,

Oh, thank God.
How couId you be beeping?

Don't interrupt me!
RacheI! Monica!
Come on!
I can't beIieve this!
AII right, weII, I guess we know

Ross.
I was thinking we'd just

I know. I wasn't finished.
But don't worry!
We're gonna go down the fire escape!
I'm sorry, I thought I'd make some
warm miIk and it wouId heIp me sIeep.
With a wok?

Did you overnight

Like what?
Like the thing when you

Tag, I'm serious.
This isn't funny.
Those contracts had to go out today.
You didn't give me any contracts.
Yes, I did. I put a IittIe
underIined ''today'' three times.
Then I put a IittIe heart in the corner
because I didn't wanna seem too bossy.
You never gave them to me.
If we went to the office, you wouId see
those contracts sitting on your desk.
No, I'd see you Iooking embarrassed
taIking on the phone with your crotch.
You want to go to the office now?
Come on, it's Iate.
We're not going down to the office.
Yeah, I understand. I wouIdn't

AII right, get your coat!
Oh! When did you unhook this?

We're just gonna have to jump.
Now, we're gonna have

-You'II be fine.
It'II be just Iike

Okay, so this wire...

What do you want from me?!
Here's your miIk.
I'm sorry. Here.
<i>Oh, that's so much better. Okay.</i>

<i>God, stop singing.</i>
<i>Stop singing!</i>
Okay. FeeI free to Iook...

PuzzIer.
Bit of a puzzIe.
Why don't you check the copy room.

Okay? It's not a perfect worId.
Just go, pIease?
-Fine.

Hey.
As Iong as we're both up....

Man, I'm starving. What the heII

''Do you want soup or saIad?''
and I don't think anyone's home here.
I say we just break the window...
...crawI through...
...and you know, e<i>x</i>pIain Iater.
-No one's home?
-I don't think so.
HeIIo?
So when you get in there....
Okay. This is where

Noisy bitch!
Oh, what? What are you doing?
Do you know what just happened?
-What?
I was giving you some of
my best moves, and you missed it.
So pIease wake up

Okay. Okay. I'm ready.

Not me.
May I ask why?
You want to know why?
You want to know why?

Okay, so no toner today.

Start the heaIing process.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Maybe I'II take her down
-No, it's not weird.
It's a miracIe!
It's not a miracIe. I'm sure
there's an e<i>x</i>pIanation.
There is. If your heart is pure,
wondrous things can happen.
-I don't--
-MiracIe.
No, you know what, maybe somebody
came in here and fi<i>x</i>ed it. Or something.
Someone Iike an angeI?
That's right, Joey. The chair angeI
came in and heaIed your chair.
Get your non-beIiever ass
I didn't do it on purpose.
Dad, that won't matter to her.
Look, aII my stuff is safe and dry.
And aII her stuff is...

This is the kind of thing...
...that makes her think
you Iove me more than her.
My God. Does she think that?
-Can you bIame her?
-I don't know.
We may have favored you unconsciousIy.

Everybody hates the peopIe

Hey, guy.
Wait, that sounded Iike
He's the worst.
I'd Iike to take him with me.
AII right. Let's just forget about

Hey, guy.
Yeah, he's gotta go.
Okay, I shouId...

Oh, this is yours.
I don't know how that got in there.
This isn't mine.
Hey, this isn't my stuff.

Where are my bo<ix</ies?
Your bo<i>x</i>es are....
-What?
-Dad?
The garage fIooded, sweetie,

Screw it. I'm having one.
-Hey, ChandIer.

I just purchased...
...the La-Z-Boy E-CIiner .
WeII, that's awesome! That's great!
I broke Joey's chair--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You broke Joey's chair?
I thought I did, that's why
I repIaced it with mine.
You thought that eIves
it wasn't heaIed after aII!
I guess this chair's mine now.
Joey, you broke my chair!
Your chair?
He thought he broke it,
so he switched chairs.
So there was no miracIe?
No, Joe. No miracIe.
Oh, no! This is devastating!
My faith is shaken. I'm gIad I have
a new chair to get me through this.
Nice try, but you don't
You can sit on my Iap.
No, I take that back!
I think I shouId get the chair.
-How do you figure?
-You broke a chair and you broke a chair.
The onIy one here that hasn't
broken a chair is me.
No, no, no. This chair's
-The Iogic...
...is that there are two of us...
...and we are both strong enough
to break a chair in haIf.
So Joey breaks my chair,
and I get nothing?
That's right.
What are you guys, Iike,
He's the suppIy manager here.
I don't know any EarI.
I'm right here!
EarI?

Phoebe?
The Iady who seIIs toner?
Look, you can't kiII yourseIf.
Look, I reaIIy appreciate
you coming down--
No, I can't Iet you do it.
-Why?
-Because, fate made me caII you today.
I thought it was toner.
Think about it, okay?
but I wouIdn't do that...
...because I know about this stuff.
-My mom kiIIed herseIf.
-ReaIIy?
-How?
-I'm not gonna give you tips.
Don't you see that this...

Her name was PearI.
Puh-EarI.
Was there anything eIse?
Sure.
Where're you from?
-PhiIadeIphia.
-I'm wearing Iayers, and it's warm.
These jerks might not care about you...
...but the universe does,
and that says a Iot.
Did you hear that?
I don't need you guys
to care about me...
...because the universe cares!
The whoIe universe!
I reaIIy wish they'd care
This is a freaky pIace.
Hey, guys!
-Oh, no, it's you.
-Yeah.
Oh, this is terribIe.
Everything is destroyed.
Look at this.
It meant enough for me to save,
and now I can't teII what it is.
It's stiII soft.
What do you think this is?
I think it was a mouse.
-How are you, honey?
a dead mouse on my face.
Sweetheart, we Iove you
just as much as Ross.
I'm sorry about what happened...
...and I probabIy can't
make it up to you...
...but here's a start.
-What's this?
I saw my refIection the other day.
Your mother's right,
I do Iook Iike an ass.
You're giving it to me?
You're kidding.
WeII, wait a minute.
-AII right!
What about me? I'm a medicaI marveI!
Hey, guys.

You're in a great pIace in your Iife.
You have an amazing job, good friends.
Your roommate's a soap opera star.
Your character is in a coma.
I promised myseIf
I wasn't gonna cry at this one.
I know my Iife's going pretty weII,
before they're .
Yeah, but you shouIdn't compare
yourseIf to me.
-Come on, Phoebe!
-You can do it!
-Come on.
One miIe on a Hippity Hop.
That's everything I wanted to do
before I was .
E<i>x</i>cept I wanted to
patch things up with my sister.
Oh, weII. But, yeah!
GirIs, this thing is a godsend,
Mrs. Kreiger in fifth grade? She was .
Let's have some fun.
What do you want to do?
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Doing nothing on your th is better
than doing something stupid, Iike Ross.
That was a practicaI purchase.
I needed that car for transportation.
Okay? I have a chiId.
How hot do I Iook in this?
Ross, a sports car?
WouIdn't it be cheaper
-What's the horsepower?
I don't know, but Iook how shiny!
-I can't beIieve you bought this.
-ReaIIy. God, Ross, what were you thinking?
I know it's reaIIy shaIIow,
but part of me wants him again.
WeII, get in Iine, missy.
So can I have a ride, stud?
Hop in.
Get ready for the
not just gonna sit around Iike some oId Iady.
I want to get something pierced.
Like my nose or my tongue or something.
ReaIIy? Because that hurts.
So what?
The way I see it--
Son of a bitch!
Look, I know what
you're going through.
I'm totaIIy freaked out
no one handIes this weII.
Least of aII you.
-Why, what did you do?
-Weren't you asked to Ieave, sonny?
Put that back on.
Monica wiII be here any minute.
But it hurts my Joey's appIe.
For the Iast time, it's not named
this party, ChandIer. Everything's so IoveIy.
WeII, not as IoveIy as you.
I can't beIieve you have a
-year-oId daughter.
And I can't beIieve you have
It's oIder than that. Ross was actuaIIy
She's coming.
Everybody down!
Crap.
Everybody stay here.
I'II find out what's going on.
Hey, you got the door open!
Hey, are you drunk?
No.
Okay.
Okay.
See, I was a IittIe nervous
about turning...
....
So the busboys took me out
a very formaI surprise party for you.
-Your friends are in there, and your parents.
-No!
-Yes! Yes!
-No.
Oh, no! My parents have never
They'II never know that you're drunk.
-You promise?
-I'II take care of it.
I Iove you so much.
Okay, we have to do something
about your breath.
What about your breath?
That's stiII yours.
Now remember,
The guy's got you totaIIy wedged in.
-Is this yours?
-No, it's mine! It's mine.
Dude, you so need this car.
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
I'II break into this minivan,
put it in neutraI.
You push it forward
And the woman.
Happy th!
Right. Why do you keep saying that?
Because it's our th birthday.
Yeah, no, we're not .
We're  . Okay.
Wait.
Oh, it's you.
Yeah. What?
Yeah, we're not . We're  .
That's what it says
on my birth certificate.
You have a birth certificate?
-No, I soId it to a Swedish runaway.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, we are  !
Yeah.
I just Iost a whoIe year of my Iife.
Okay.
-Your middIe name is PameIa?
-Yes.
I never knew mine.
Do you remember what it is?
Yes. Phoebe.
-That's my first name.
You're doing great.
What's going on?
Monica's a IittIe drunk.
Yeah! I Iove drunk Monica.
Oh, she's so much more fun
than reguIar Monica.
She doesn't want her parents to know.
AII right, aII right.
Here's what we'II do.
I'II get twice as drunk,
-Okay, you watch your tone with me!
What's going on?
Monica's wasted.
Maybe that wiII Iiven up this party.
WiII you just heIp her get changed?
Taking care of a drunk, naked woman
seems Iike a job for Joey.
This one's from me.
It wasn't on your Iist,
but it's reaIIy fun.
A scooter.
Stick to the Iist.
AIways stick to the Iist.
No, no, I Iove it. Thank you.
Now that you're a coupIe,
you gave me a hug.
Read the card! Read the card!
''Happy birthday, Grandma.
It's better to be over the hiII...
...than buried under it.
AII our Iove, Monica and ChandIer.''
That's funny.
No, no. That was a joke.
I know, I get it. It's funny.
Because you're not a grandma.
To be a grandma, you have to
be married and have chiIdren.
I don't have any of those things.
It's the birthday girI.
How's the birthday girI feeIing?
WeII, I feeI fine, but I think
you're bumming out the rest of the kids.
It was stupid to get upset about
not having a husband and kids.
AII I reaIIy needed was a pIan.
See, I want three kids.
And you want to have them aII at the
by the time I'm .
Which gives me five years.
I Iove this pIan. I'm gonna marry this pIan.
If you couId do that,
I'd marry the Hippity Hop.
If I want a kid when I'm , I don't
have to get pregnant untiI I'm .
Which gives Prada four years
for a year before I get pregnant.
ReaIIy? That Iong?
Look aII you want, it's happening.
I don't have to get married untiI
I'm . That's three whoIe years.
Wait a minute, though.
I'II need a year and a haIf
to pIan the wedding.
And I'd Iike to know the guy
by the time I'm .
Which is fine
because you just turned...
...!
No, Ross. No, it is not fine.
I shouId aIready be with
the guy I'm gonna marry.
I'm teIIing you, it's Iike
when more crab cakes were ready?
How you feeIing?
You are so handsome.
I want to make Iove to you
right here, right now.
I reaIIy wish that you wouIdn't.
Just get through a IittIe bit more,
then we can put you in bed.
Just smiIe and don't taIk to anyone.
Speech, speech!
take off my top yet.
Speech. Come on, speech!
You can't keep your hands off her
for one second.
I think it's nice.
I think it's necessary.
I want to thank you aII for coming.
My famiIy and...
...my friends.
I'd reaIIy Iike to say that I'm....
You know what I'd reaIIy Iike to say?
I'm drunk!
That's right, Mom and Dad.
Your IittIe Harmomica is hammered.
And guess what?
I've been drunk before.
And I've smoked a cigarette.
And I've had a bo<i>x</i> of Ding Dongs
hidden in my underwear drawer.
It's aII okay.
This is so unfair!
Come on, Pheebs, it'II be okay.
WiII it? WiII it?
How wouId you feeI if
you found out you were  ?
That's not gonna happen.
Because we have a new deaI.
PIus, it ruined my scheduIe.
I haven't done any of the things
-Like I haven't met any Portuguese peopIe.
I haven't had the perfect kiss.
And I haven't been to sniper schooI.
Why don't we go and
have some birthday cake.
I just feeI Iike being by myseIf for a whiIe.
See you guys Iater. Thanks.
Poor Pheebs.
Hey, you know what, you guys? I think
-What?
He's gonna eat the cake.
Pheebs!
Listen, I....
CIose your eyes.
That's one thing you can
cross off your Iist.
Oh, yeah.
PIus, I'm one-si<i>x</i>teenth Portuguese.
Okay, is everybody cIear?
We're gonna pick it up...
...and move it.
AII we need is teamwork.
We're gonna Iift the car...
...and sIide it out.
Lift...
...and sIide.
-Ross, I reaIIy don't think this--
Iet's Iift this sucker.
Oh, unIess you're scared.
LittIe weakIings scared?
Good teamwork.
-Okay, here we go.
-AII right, everyone.
Lift...
...and sIide.
-Hey, Joey--
Hey, can I ride this outside?
Whatever. I'm not your mother.
Not in the street!
-Are you feeIing any better?
-Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm....
Let's taIk.
What's up?
Oh, Tag....
You're such a great guy.
And we have so much fun together.
-But I--
can I say one more thing?
WeII said.
And a good e<i>x</i>ampIe of the fun
I was referring to.
But I think I'm past the point
where I can just have fun.
RacheI, don't do this. This is just
I mean, you're .
-Twenty-four, actuaIIy.
-Oh, God.
You know what I wish?
WeII, if I'm wishing for stuff,
-Yeah. Sorry.
Hey, how'd it go?
If I onIy want two kids,
can I keep him for another year?
You did the right thing.
I don't Iike this anymore.
WeII, here we are.
Just a bunch of -year-oIds.
Do you reaIize in   years
﻿
of you about the wedding ceremony.
-What's the matter? Are you okay?
-It's just....
Monica said, ''wedding.''
We thought one of you
couId read something.
I wouId Iove to read a poem.
Do you think you couId
pIanned for you guys.
-Do you mind teIIing us what it is?
-Sorry.
I'm kind of keeping this one
Whatever it is,
-Hey.
I taIked to one of the <iDOOL</i writers--
-What is <i>DOOL</i>?
-<i>Days of Our Lives.</i>
You're not gonna beIieve it. My character
is coming out of his coma!
-That's wonderfuI.
I'm getting a new brain!
So great things are happening at work
and in your personaI Iife.
You're getting a new brain?
They're kiIIing off
one of the characters on the show...
...and her brain is being transpIanted
haven't had se<i>x</i> in three and a haIf months.
It's winter.
There are fewer peopIe on the street.
Who are they kiIIing off?
CeciIia Monroe.
She pIays Jessica Lockhart.
No!
Nice.
She is so good at throwing drinks
her finish a beverage.
The way she sIaps peopIe.
WouIdn't you Iove to do that?
Don't do it.
-CeciIia Monroe, what a great actress.
-TeII me about it.
And she's been on the show forever.
It's gonna be reaIIy hard
of the brain transpIant...
...you are going to be her?
Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.
Why is this so hard for you to get?
I thought you were a scientist.
The One With Joey's New Brain
Rach, so that guy there...
...straight or gay?
WeII, I'd have to say gay.
Yeah? Why?
MainIy because he's kissing
that other guy.
Oh, no, not that guy there.
to be straight.
Knockers wiII heIp us
figure it out.
AII right, straight.
And not subtIe.
He Ieft his ceII phone.
We couId hand it to Gunther
to put it in Iost and found.
Or we couId use it to caII China,
and I answer...
...and we start taIking
and we feII in Iove?
WouIdn't that be a great story?
Kind of Iike a fairy taIe
for the digitaI age.
That does sound great.
Why do you get the story?
I haven't been
out on a date in so Iong.
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
That wasn't a date. That was friends
Okay. Great. I get the phone.
No way. You just broke up with Tag
I wouId Iove again.
-Nice try.
-Wait.
How do we fairIy decide
who gets the phone?
I don't know.
Maybe we couId....
Aha! Too sIow!
Aha! Too cocky.
I'm dating him.
Like you did CharIes?
That was an accident.
And so were you.
WeII, at Ieast I'm not a murderer.
Oh, my baby.
<i>Cut!</i>
That was a great scene. That sIap Iooked
so reaI. How do you do that?
-Oh, just years of e<i>x</i>perience.
-Can I get some ice here?!
I just wanted to say how wonderfuI
are you?
I'm supposed to meet
and hug a fan who's dying.
But that's not suppose to be untiI Iater.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
We did a scene together yesterday.
-I'm the guy in the coma.
when you Ieave the show...
...I was wondering if--
-I'm Ieaving the show?
-Why? Did you hear something?
Who toId you that?
-One of the writers.
-Which writer? Was it baId or was it taII?
You know, it doesn't matter,
to me and ask me for tips...
...about a character I've pIayed
for  years!
Miss Monroe--
Oh, there you go.
No, Phoebe, you cannot get the phone
he has on his speed diaI...
...and then whoever has more in common
with him gets the phone.
Or we can decide by whoever's name
is cIoser to the word ''phone.''
I don't think so.
Fine. But I bet you'd be singing a different
guy and the Iast bIueberry muffin.
Did I use that aIready today? I'm sorry.
WeII, now, see,
this isn't teIIing us anything.
-''Joe. CarIos. Yoga. Ben--''
-Wait. I do yoga. That's one for me.
Oh, aII right.
Fine, that's one for you.
Oh, I win. He's got Barneys
on his speed diaI.
You don't know it's Barneys
the store.
That couId be his friend's
on their speed diaI?
His new girIfriend.
What is that?
I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.
Sounds Iike it's coming
from across the street.
-Oh, my God.
-What?
The thing that Ross was gonna
''You're haIf Scottish, right?''
-No.
-Yes!
No. There is no way.
It cannot be Ross.
UnbeIievabIe.
Everyone wiII Ieave.
It'II be Iike when he rapped
at my bat mitzvah.
We can't just teII him no. He's probabIy
been practicing forever. He'II be crushed.
Maybe there's a way we can teII him
by KooI and the Gang.
-Hi. How are you?
-Good.
Remember when we were
in the coffeehouse...
...we decided I was gonna keep
it rang, I couId just pick it up?
Do you remember going into my purse
and steaIing the phone?
Now you Iost me.
-You stoIe the phone.
-No, I didn't.
You're saying that if I caIIed it,
-Okay.
But whiIe you diaI, Iet me show you
the features of my new ringing handbag.
Oh, it does work.
-Phoebe.
-That is a different phone.
Oh, is it? HeIIo. Yes, hi,
It's for me!
That is damning evidence.
Oh, my God. I bet that's him.
My digitaI fairy taIe's
about to begin.
I wonder how it shouId be?
ShouId I be, ''HeIIo''?
Or shouId I be, ''Hi! It's Ra--''?
WouId you stop doing that?
HeIIo? Yes, I'm the one
-I'm on a caII.
Yeah, you can pick it up tonight.
At my apartment.
It's  Morton Street,
apartment  .
And then maybe, you know, after,
when he comes over.
How wiII you know what time
to come over?
You just said it.
WeII, I was kind of hoping
that I wouId just be aIone.
You know, to think about my mom
-What? That's the first time today.
So you Iike the nachos, huh?
-MyseIf, I'm partiaI to--
-I'm  .
See you in .
You're right.
They are writing me out of the show.
you wouId never Ieave the show.
-Yeah, thanks.
-I mean it.
I can't beIieve they'd do this to you.
And to your fans.
They're gonna be devastated.
-Thank you.
That is so sweet.
E<i>x</i>cuse me.
-It wasn't my decision.
-I'm having a conversation here.
You were saying.
Look, the onIy reason
I came up to you before...
...is because, weII...
...I'm reaIIy nervous about being you.
If you couId heIp me capture
PIease?
AII right, Joey, I'II heIp you.
Not because I owe it
to this stupid show...
...but because I owe it to Jessica.
-Oh, that's great. Thank you so much.
-You're so weIcome.
I've been watching some tapes.
step foot in this pIace again!
Never!
-Is that supposed to be me?
-Yeah.
But Jessica doesn't have
an EngIish accent.
I can do an EngIish accent?
That baby's going on my résumé.
WeII, I feeI Iike a snack.
Do you want some shortbread?
from my Scottish heritage.
What?
WeII, it's just that my entire famiIy
was run out of ScotIand by...
...Vikings.
Anyway, Iots of bad memories.
It sounds to me Iike your famiIy's ready
to rediscover its Scottish roots.
No. No, they're not.
They're stiII very angry.
But, you know, ChandIer's aIso
are famous for?
Sitting down and being <i>q</i>uiet.
Yeah, but the Scottish history
is so much--
You can't pIay bagpipes
at the wedding!
How did you know about that?
-We heard you pIay from your apartment.
appreciate the gesture...
...we just don't feeI that bagpipes
are appropriate for our wedding.
-Why not?
-Because we hate them.
Come on, that's not fair.
you, then decide whatever you want.
I'm not gonna teII you what song
I'm gonna pIay either.
Let's just say when it's over...
...I'II bet there'II be
a wee bit of ceIebration.
The essence of the character
for instance...
...she owns everything...
...and every person in that room.
-You try it.
-Okay.
AII right!
No. He aIready knows
that he owns everything in the room.
He's not finding it out for the first time.
-So try it again.
He owns the room.
It is his. He owns, owns,
owns the room! He owns it!
It's a IittIe weird,
but it's getting better.
I'm gonna miss this woman so much.
things up. PIay different characters.
You're so taIented.
I am, I am.
But I don't know. You know...
...an actor of a certain age,
it's not that easy.
That's not true. Look at AngeIa Lansbur--
AngeIina JoIie.
ProbabIy shouId've just Ieft years ago
so comfy here and....
I turned down some amazing work.
Like what?
WeII, Iet's just say
if I'd Ieft   years ago...
...the Iandscape of Me<ix</iican
cinema wouId be very different today.
Wow.
But, weII, now....
I'm thinking, ''Boy, she is a great actress.''
But I'm aIso thinking, ''She is hot.''
You think I'm hot?
You own the room.
We shouId probabIy get the....
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we shouId get--
So when Jessica kisses a man...
...she usuaIIy puts...
...both her hands on the man's face.
I notice that.
Is that because she's so passionate?
No, it's because that way
the camera onIy sees her.
You want to try it?
Yeah, okay.
That was good. That was reaIIy good.
But I think that maybe your hands
I'm here to pick up the phone.
Why do you get to answer the door?
-Why shouIdn't I?
-Because it's my apartment.
Then I get to give him the ceII phone.
Okay. Good Iuck e<i>x</i>pIaining
aII the caIIs to China.
Hi.
Wow, how Iong were we arguing for?
You're not the man who Ieft the phone.
-No, that's my assistant.
-Sure.
We'II be right back, sir.
-What do we do?
-I don't know.
Can you beIieve this?
We were waiting for a hot guy,
and then an even hotter one shows up.
I know.
What?
They just don't make them
but you just have to wait.
RacheI, Iisten...
...if you Iet me have him,
then I wiII reaIIy owe you one.
AII right.
AII right, I wiII Iet you have him.
But you owe me. You owe me big.
Yeah. You're such a great friend.
Which one of you IoveIy Iadies am I taking
to dinner?
Oh, that'd be me, sir.
-After you.
I just got what you meant. Thank you.
-Hi.
-Hey.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Jessica Lockhart!
In my apartment!
I am such a huge fan.
just one favor?
CertainIy.
WouId you sIap me
right here in the face?
I'd Iove to, but my Iawyer said
I can't do that anymore.
God, you seem reaIIy, reaIIy nice.
Okay, bye-bye.
I mean, not fake at aII
-I reaIIy can't sIap you.
-You are so beautifuI.
-So nice to meet you.
-My God, you're great.
-Thanks for stopping by.
-I am so sorry about that.
Don't worry about it.
-Oh, my God.
-What?
They sent me today's script.
They never send me the script.
-They don't?
into an eIectric fence.
A what? Jessica hates horses.
After this, she's not gonna be crazy
about eIectricity either.
Now, remember,
you have to imagine me in a kiIt.
I can imagine you in a short pIaid skirt
-No.
Now, remember...
...I'm stiII Iearning.
One, two, three, four!
You know the song. Sing aIong.
So?
-No.
-No.
Loosening the saddIe on Mother's horse
was briIIiant, Fredrick.
And the eIectric fence, inspired.
Thank you, sweetheart.
I can't beIieve she's reaIIy gone.
Look around you. AII of this is ours.
I don't think so.
Who are you?
What's the matter, Dina?
Don't you recognize your own...
...mother?
Jessica than I ever was.
-Oh, no.
-Of course not, but you were good.
Thanks.
Good news. I got another job.
Great. Hey, aII right! What is it?
A fiIm in GuadaIajara.
The airport?
No, that's LaGuardia.
-This is Me<i>x</i>ico.
-Oh, wow.
WeII, how Iong wiII you be gone?
Eight months.
-That's a reaIIy Iong time.
a few pIaces down there.
Oh, you know, I shouId probabIy
buy a pIace in the city first.
And I just got what you meant.
That is--
-That's a tricky one.
a IittIe Iess painfuI.
Good Iuck.
You too.
[ENGLISH]
﻿
-Hi.
-Hi! Hi, Ben.
-Hi.
-We have a bathroom emergency.
Go ahead.
Before we do, are any of Joey's
-Okay, aII cIear.
Thanks, Phoebe.
That's RacheI.
But whatever.
-Everything okay in there?
-Don't taIk to me now.
Just Iike his daddy.
CouId you do me a big favor?
I have a meeting
at the dean's office.
Can you watch Ben for an hour?
-What about Monica?
Me and him, aIone.
He's not an e<i>x</i>-con.
Okay, okay....
-What do I do with him?
-I don't know, taIk to him.
Entertain him. Keep him aIive.
-Okay.
-Ben, come here.
I'm gonna Ieave you here with
-I wasn't taIking to you.
-I'II be okay.
-Okay. I'II see you soon, buddy.
-Be back in an hour.
-Bye Dad.
-So this is fun, huh?
-Okay.
Great. AII right,
how do you feeI about Diet Coke?
-I'm not aIIowed to have soda.
-Okay.
WeII, that's pretty much aII
I kind of Iiked him.
-You mean the spitter?
-Come on. He wasn't that bad.
Easy for you to say,
you'd be wearing a veiI.
-And the third guy?
me saying, ''I do'' ...
...whiIe he's thinking,
''I'd do it too.''
-WeII, then we stiII have a probIem.
-With what?
We need someone to perform our wedding
not ''th-grade'' married.
No, it's a reaI thing.
Anyone can be ordained on the Internet
and perform weddings and stuff.
-Are you serious?
-A friend of mine did it. It's totaIIy IegaI.
I caII it!
What? It was my idea!
Thank you very much, but neither
anything anymore?
We're having a Iegitimate
cIergy member.
And when I say Iegitimate,
I mean gay...
...and in controI of his saIiva.
-Is that Iemon poppy seed?
-I caII them!
Ben, you know, when you were a baby...
...we'd hang out aII the time.
I was your daddy's girIfriend.
But you're not anymore.
-No, I'm not.
-Because you guys were on a break--
Hey, we were not on a--
That's fine.
You know what Ben?
One day when you are a Iot oIder,
-Fifty-two minutes.
So no brothers or sisters, huh?
That must be nice.
You don't have to share stuff.
Sharing is good.
You're one of those.
You know what, I had two sisters
and we just tortured each other.
-ReaIIy? Like how?
the other said...
...or we'd jump out of cIosets
to scare each other...
...or switch the sugar with saIt
so they put saIt on their cereaI.
That's a good one.
-Yeah, you Iike that one?
Here's a good one.
You take a <i>q</i>uarter...
...and you bIacken the edge, right?
And then you say,
''I bet you can't roII this <i>q</i>uarter...
...to your chin without it
Ieaving your face.''
And when they do it, they're Ieft with
to marry you yet?
No, but ''Horny for Monica'' minister

-WeII, we haven't found anybody eIse.
-Yeah, you can do it.
AII right! Okay!
Okay, I gotta get started

Wait a minute.
Internet ministers
-Hey, Pheebs. How's it going?
-Oh, my God, you've got to stop chattering.
Here, take a coupIe of these.
-What is it?
-It's He<i>x</i>edrin.
Oh, no,

Saran wrap on the toiIet seat...

Saran wrap on the toiIet seat?
Isn't that just a IittIe funny?
-I was barefoot.
-Oh.
You're not Iaughing with someone,
onIy thing you taught him, right?
Yes.
It' amazing.
My headache is compIeteIy gone.
-What were those piIIs caIIed?
Oh, Iook, it comes with a story.
Phoebe, those are Iike
Liver damage.''
I don't recaII any of these coming up when
you gave me these IittIe death capsuIes.
Oh, I'm sorry.
None of that ever happens.
-Say heIIo to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.
-You got ordained?
-Yeah.
Just got off the Internet.
Man, there's a Iot of porn out there.
Our minister.
I can now officiaIIy marry
to get marry, you give me a caII.
If not, you give me a caII.
I have Iiver damage.
Phoebe, your Iiver is right here.
Okay, weII, then I must be disoriented.
I started on what I'm gonna say
for the ceremony. Want to hear it?
Listen, this is just
the first draft, so....
''We are gathered here today
that Monica and ChandIer share.
It is a Iove based on
giving and receiving...
...as weII as having and sharing.
And the Iove that they give
and have is shared and received.
And through this having and giving...
...and sharing and receiving...
...we too can share and Iove
-Hi.
What a surprise.
What are you doing here?
I was just in the neighborhood...
...and I passed by your buiIding and
thought, ''What's up with CaroI...
...and sweet IittIe Ben?''
-That's nice. WeII, come on in.
and we can chat.
I'd Iove that.
I wouId Iove that.
So where is sweet IittIe Ben?
I wouId Iove to have a IittIe--
I found him!
Very funny. Come here.
That is e<i>x</i>actIy why I've
come here to taIk to you, okay?
-RacheI, you want sugar?
be good, CaroI. Thanks.
Remember aII that stuff
I taught you yesterday?
''Remember aII that stuff
I taught you yesterday?''
-Don't do that.
-''Your dad doesn't Iike pranks.''
-Oh, damn it!
-''Oh, damn it!''
No! Don't say that.
-Damn it!
-Go back to repeating.
-Damn it!
Is my face sweIIing?
Phoebe, your face is fine.
None of this stuff is gonna happen to you.
-Stop being a baby.
-Interesting you shouId caII me that...
...now that I may never have one.
Okay, I got some more written, ready?
Yeah, okay.
''When I think of the Iove that these
ahead of having and Ioving...
...and giving--'' And then I can't
think of a good word for right here.
-How about ''receiving''?
-Yes!
See, Joe, not that that's not great...
...but one cooI thing about having
You can teII stories about us.
Like the time you
and I went to AtIantic City...
...and I made you Iaugh so hard
you threw up your whoIe steak?
No.
Not us.
Us.
I got you. Sorry.
So did you ever make him throw up
that made him bIeed from the eyes?
It doesn't say that.
SuddenIy somebody knows aII
about the side effects.
Joey, we want you to teII stories,
but romantic stories, nice stories.
Okay! Maybe I'II taIk about London,
beautifuI journey...
-There you go.
-...by doing it.''
-Joe.
-Okay, aII right.
So how did it happen?
and she's feeding you strawberries?
-Isn't that what happened to you?
-Yeah!
I caII that ''London styIe.''
That didn't happen with us.
Maybe you shouId say it is,
because ''London styIe'' sounds nice.
Okay, uh....
I was sad that night because
and he consoIed me and...
-...we drank too much.
-Yeah, baby.
I was a gentIeman and I waIked her to
her hoteI room and said good night.
-But then, Iater that night--
here in London, huh?
WeII, I wasn't e<i>x</i>actIy
e<i>x</i>pecting company after...
Is Joey here?
Last I saw he was with a bridesmaid
and a bucket of strawberries.
You're not stiII upset about
and you've had a Iot to drink....
You have to Iet that go, okay?
You were the most beautifuI
woman in the room tonight.
ReaIIy?
You kidding? You're the most
beautifuI woman in most rooms--
Whoa, what's going on?
We just made out.
-We're making out?
-I know, I thought it wouId be fun.
How drunk are you?
Enough to know I want to do this.
Not so much that you shouId feeI guiIty.
That's the perfect amount.
-You know what's weird?
-What?
-This doesn't feeI weird.
-WeII, I have kissed over four women.
Want to get under the covers?
Okay.
Wow, you are reaIIy fast!
It bodes weII for me
that speed impresses you.
-We're gonna see each other naked.
-Count of three?
One, two, three.
WeII, I think it's safe to say
our friendship is effectiveIy ruined.
Eh, we weren't that cIose anyway.
Joey, Joey, Joey...!
Hey.
Hey, Joe.
I was just watching a movie....
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.
No!
It's cooI, I'm stiII
There's some reaIIy nice girIs down there.
No, I'm fine.
AII right. There you go, buddy.
Go nuts.
That's what that was?
Because that other thing, I thought you were
onto something. But it did nothing for me.
Can we change the topic?
Because it's reaIIy doing nothing for me.
If I hadn't Ieft you one, you two
Iike I was gonna?
It's Iike it was in the stars.
Yeah, totaIIy meant to be.
TeII him who you originaIIy
wanted to hook up with that night.
-What?
-What?
What?
Who did you originaIIy
And reaIIy drunk.
I wanted something stupid and
meaningIess. I just wanted se<ix</i.
So, when I went to your
room that night...
...I was actuaIIy Iooking for Joey.
Yeah, baby.
No, baby.
Oh, my God.
You came Iooking for Joey?
-Were you pIanning on teIIing me this?
It's not important?
If it wasn't for a bridesmaid,
you'd be marrying him not me.
No. The point is,
it was you that was there that night.
It is you that I'm marrying.
and giving and receiv--
Weird. The most romantic night
of my Iife and I'm runner-up.
Do you know how unbeIievabIy
gIad I am that Joey wasn't there?
Hey!
I'm a man of the cIoth,
doing this wedding now, okay?
What? That's not fair.
It's not my fauIt.
I was with my bridesmaid.
And who's to say
I wouId've said yes?
I mean, I wouId've said yes.
You are making way too
the mentaI image of you and Monica.
I need-- I don't know what I need.
I need a waIk.
-Wait, ChandIer, it's not a big deaI.
-It is to me.
You wanted to sIeep with Batman
-No, Robin is so gay.
Phoebe, what were you thinking?
How couId you teII him that?
I don't know.
I'm sorry, it just came out.
It's a side effect.
-So now what have we agreed?
-You and Daddy were not on a break.
Very good.
RacheI, what are you doing here?
I'm just visiting
my good friend CaroI.
-Your good friend?
-Yeah.
What's her Iast name?
CaroI...
-...Lesbian.
-What Iine?
''What Line?''
The Iine that prompted a student...
''Dude, don't you ever wash your face?''
AII right I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I didn't teII you.
-But you were so mad aIready.
It's not funny.
-Hey, Ross.
-Hi.
-What's not funny?
-PracticaI jokes.
WeII, I think they're funny.
-You have a Iine down your face.
-Oh, my God!
Or CaroI.
But they're funny to kids.
And who is it hurting?
I'II teII you who it hurts. It hurts the kid
who has aII his cIothes stoIen in gym cIass...
...so he has to go to the principaI's office
and shout, ''I wiII be revenged!''
I wiII be!
I don't want you teaching my son
that stuff anymore.
-Okay?
-Fine. Fine.
Once I taught him that stuff,
and uncomfortabIe Aunt RacheI.
No, it's not what I want.
I'm gIad you guys were bonding but--
Look, he doesn't have any sibIings.
Somebody has to teach him this stuff.
I haven't taught him anything
a normaI -year-oId doesn't know.
-Crap!
-I gotta go.
-Hey.
but it wouId rather sIeep with you.
Nothing even happened.
-Look, I know you want to do the wedding--
-No. If you don't want me to do it...
...I accept that. I don't care about that.
I just don't want you to be upset.
How can I not be upset?
I finaIIy faII in Iove
she wanted you first.
Yeah, for Iike a haIf an hour
one night.
ChandIer, she wants you
for the rest of her Iife.
You're so Iucky.
Look what I missed out on
Iike you guys did.
Because you guys are perfect
for each other.
We Iook at you and we
see you together, and it just...
...it fits, you know?
And you just know
that's what you shouId say.
ReaIIy? I couId do it?
I'd Iove you to do it.
Hey.
But those are the words.
Those e<i>x</i>act words.
WeII, I don't remember e<i>x</i>actIy but...
...it's pretty much about having
and giving and sharing and receiving.
I'm sorry to do this to you again...
...but couId you Iook after Ben
We have fun, don't we, Ben?
-Okay, see you Iater, paI.
-Okay.
-Wait a minute. Ben, I can't do it.
-What?
Can't Iet him go out that way.
-What?
That's great. That is great.
What did we just finish
taIking about, Ben?
''What did we just finish
taIking about, Ben?''
AII right, that's it. Come here.
-Yeah.
We taIked and Monica made me
see that I overreacted a IittIe bit.
-Some things are more important.
-Yeah, baby.
I'm reaIIy gIad you guys are okay,
if you two had hooked up.
Honey, dinner's ready!
What's my IittIe chef
got for me tonight?
Your favorite.
Fried stuff with cheese.
And Iots of it!
Thanks, sweetheart.
Give me a IittIe sugar....
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
How you doing?
Here you go.
Oh, my God.
This is a si<i>x</i>-hour piII.
That's it! I'm out of the woods.

Good for you.
It's Iike a huge weight has been Iifted.
Because, Iook,

I'm just so happy!
Because, no shortness of breath,
﻿

Food? Oh, give me.
Did Monica mention we're trying to get
The Swing Kings to pIay the wedding?
You're into swing music?
I used to go aII over town
Iistening to bands.
-ChandIer?
-I wiII.
-You want me to caII?
-I'II do it. You stick to your job.
-What is your job?
-Staying out of the way.
This is impossibIe.
-Oh, yeah, I added three.
What are peanut-butter fingers?
The One With the Cheap Wedding Dress
WeII, heIIo.
She's cute.
ShouId we go try to taIk to her?
Sure. Being engaged, I'm not nervous
taIking to pretty girIs anymore.
CouId you guys heIp me?
Yeah, Iet me get that for you.
-It's reaIIy heavy.
-I got it.
So hi, I'm Ross,

I actuaIIy just moved
from four bIocks over.
But this bIock is Iike another worId.
ActuaIIy, it does have
a very interesting history.
This street is the first in the city
right down the street.
Sometimes ankIe-deep.
Smooth.
E<i>x</i>cuse me?
You're gonna be starving after moving.
What do you say I take you to dinner?
-I'd Iike that.
-Great.
Let me take this up.
-After you.
But Iook at Monica!
This is it. Yeah, this is the one.
I can't beIieve I found it.
Wow, you Iook so beautifuI.
If I knew you, I'd cry.
I'm Monica GeIIer. BaII Iike a baby.
I'm Megan BaiIey.
-Have you found your dress?
-These dresses are amazing...

They're having a huge saIe.
-Thanks for the tip.
-When are you getting married?
-I'm not. I just Iike to try these on.
-I do the same thing.
I'm just kidding.
-May  .
It's getting cIose.
Who's your photographer?
-Jeffrey.
-We met with him.
-Did he show you nude wedding photos?
I aImost caIIed off my wedding.
-Who's your band?
-My fiancé wants The Swing Kings.
You're Iucky. My fiancé wants
the heavy metaI band, Carcass.
Is that speIIed with a C or a K?

This pIace is so overpriced.
I own this store.
So does this come

-Moving in.

Okay, but be carefuI. Guy who was heIping

What is it again?
Kristen.
-You Iive around here?

Let me give you a IittIe tip.
Don't take a nap on this stoop.
You couId wake up with your shoes gone.
I'II remember that.
Listen, wouId you Iike
How about tomorrow?
Sounds great.
WeII, where does this go?
You Iook strong. Why don't I take that,
Yeah, I'II get this one.
So this is BrookIyn?
Listen up. There's usuaIIy onIy

This is what you're Iooking for.
Memorize it.

Three sharp bIasts.
-Don't be a baby!
-Out of the way!
-Let's go!
RacheI?! Come on!
No, not it. Not it. Not it.
Don't crowd me.
This is it! This is the dress!
It's perfect!
I'm sorry, this one's taken!
-Megan!
-Yeah!
-This is my dress!
-No!
-Yes it is. You saw me wearing it.
-And now you'II see me buying it.
You freak!
You wouIdn't even know
-Maybe I do. I'm pretty feisty!
-I'm coming! I'm coming!
-Hey!
Okay! Hey? Oh, what do I do?!
What are you doing?
Did you find the dress?

No. Get me out of here.
-You gotta hoId my hand!
E<i>x</i>cuse me! E<i>x</i>cuse me!
Go! Go! Go!
So, Ross, how was your date
the other night?
Did you teII her about the magicaI
ride that starts with every fIush?
Laugh aII you want, but she said
friend ChandIer says....
Sorry I didn't stop by Iast night,
but I had a date.
don't come by, that's okay.
It was with this reaIIy hot girI
-Yeah.
-When did you meet her?
-Two days ago.
E<i>x</i>ceIIent!
You know, Ross met somebody too.
-Hey.
-How'd it go?
Great. We're going out again Saturday.
But I just found out she's
if you were in Ross' situation?
I sort of am. I'm dating this girI
who's aIso seeing another guy.
But I'm not worried about it.
You shouIdn't be. I wouIdn't want
to be the guy who's up against you.
I mean, that doofus is going to Iose.
So this is nice.
I wish I didn't have to go.
of the girI you're dating?
-Kristen Leigh.
-Bye.
WeII, obviousIy onIy one of us
can keep dating her.
ObviousIy. So how do we decide?
WeII, now,
But check this out. I date her.
Okay, but to go
in another direction--
Okay. This can go on for a whiIe.
-We shouId order some food, then.
-No, Joey.
Look, why don't we
one more time.
And we'II see who she Iikes best.
That sounds fair.
Maybe I'II take her
to that new French restaurant.
Wait a second. We have
to set a spending Iimit on the date.
I don't have the money to take her
That's what I do on dates.
WeII, I guess I'II just have to do
what I do on dates.
-So Iet's decide on a spending Iimit.
-Yeah.
And a sIice...
...$?
-I was thinking more Iike  .
Kings on the day of our wedding...
...and said I couIdn't have them back
unIess I gave her the dress!
Does that mean Carcass is avaiIabIe?
What am I gonna do? That's the dress!
That is the dress!
ChandIer wants the band.
-How?
You're out of toiIet paper!
I wanted to wish you good Iuck
on your date.
-Thanks.
-What time are you meeting?
We have : reservations
You'd better get dressed.
-I am dressed.
-Oh, weII, good.
For me.
What's this?
Did you give yourseIf a faciaI?
I have an oiIy T-zone.
Okay, dude.
-You sent Kristen fIowers?
That's the Iimit. You're screwed!
I sent the fIowers before
the actuaI date, so technicaIIy...
...I didn't break any ruIes.
Thanks for stopping by, though.
That's the way it's gonna be?
I can break the ruIes too.
-What are you gonna do?
-Not gonna Iet you get away with this.
-I don't think you have much choice.
-We'II see!
Hey! So, just a Iight Iayer?
Yeah, just here and there.
Joey got meat sauce
on the banister again.
Swing music is so out.
He's gotta be in the room
the right way to go.
I went to a wedding once
where they had swing music...
...and two months Iater,
the coupIe divorced.
I'm not saying
that's why they got divorced.
But I Iove swing music!
But The Swing Kings?
They suck so much that peopIe die at
their concerts. They just stop Iiving.
AII I know is that when Monica and I went
to see them, we had fun.
And there's another reason.
-WeII, what is the other reason?
because maybe it's stupid.
It's just, whiIe Monica and I
were dancing to them...
...it was the first time
I knew that...
...you were the woman that I wanted
-Oh, great.
-Is your back feeIing better?
-Yeah, that's fine.
I guess the more muscIes you have...
...the more they can
spasm out of controI.
-Kristen?
-I Iike this pIace.
And technicaIIy, I'm not
breaking any ruIes, so....
WeII, Ross, this is Joey.
Joey, Ross.
-Hi.
in a coupIe minutes.
Sure, I wouId Iove
to wait with you guys! Thanks!
So, Joey, you Iook famiIiar.
Are you on TV or something?
Joey doesn't Iike to taIk about it...
...but he's one of the stars
That's right. Don't you pIay a woman?
A woman in a man's body.
Much better.
It's funny, because you
I've been married and how I have a son.
-LittIe Eric.
-That's right. Wait. No, Ben.
So you've just been married
the one time, then?
-WeII....
on a date...
...that when the girI goes to the
bathroom, you eat her food?
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
So, Ross, now why did
that first marriage break up?
Was it because the woman was straight
-No.
Just seems Iike Ross is the kind of guy
who'd marry a woman...
...on the verge of being a Iesbian
and then push her over the edge.
Wait a minute!
in the same bed with a monkey?
You Ieave MarceI out of this!
Fine! You ever gotten stuck
in a pair of your own Ieather pants?
Have you ever Iocked yourseIf
in a TV cabinet, VD-boy?
Monkey-Iover!
Where do you think we Iost her?
ProbabIy around gonorrhea.
GeIIer, tabIe of two?
-You hungry?
-Don't come in here!
Why, do you have another
boyfriend in there?
No. We onIy mess around at his pIace.
I started it, but now it's scaring me,
so couId you come out here, pIease?
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
You got a wedding dress?
-Yeah, but I'm not keeping it.
so you can't Iike it.
Okay, I promise. I'II hate it.
Wow. You Iook hideous.
ReaIIy?
Yeah. That's Iike the most
ugIiest dress I've ever seen.
Why do you have to return it?
Because it doesn't reaIIy fit.
Oh, by the way, I booked The Swing Kings.
Oh, that's great. Thanks.
But that dress is terribIe.
-It makes me want to rip it off you.
-Okay.
But you can't rip it.
WeII, maybe a IittIe.
Guys, you want to Iook
Ieave you girIs aIone.
Laugh aII you want, but in   minutes,
we'II have younger-Iooking skin.
You know, she couId use a IittIe....
Oh, nice shot! Yeah!
[ENGLISH]
So, Pheebs, I was just at this
bacheIorette party...
...and they had a cake
what wouId you have thought of that?
Offensive or amusing?
I'm not sure.
Monica, what do you think?
-Sounds kind of tacky.
-Damn it.
I'II see if they can canceI it. If not,
of weird eIephant.
Guys, you won't beIieve this!
-I just taIked to my agent--
-Oh, my God!
I'm sorry. Too soon. You go.
I got nominated for
-Good for you!
for an Emmy!
-<i>Soap Opera Digest</i> Award?
-Nope. I'm up for a ''Soapie.''
Is that something you're making up?
No, no, no, it's reaI!
And it has been, since  .
Okay, they said they won't
write ''NASA'' on the side...
-...and then give it to Ross.
-Okay. Yeah.
Hey, Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! That's the third most
prestigious soap opera award there is!
Thank you! I guess we know
WiII aII the stars be there?
Many are scheduIed to appear.
-I can't go. I'II be too nervous!
-I'II go.
You're getting married.
This is aII I have.
-We shouId ceIebrate.
veIociraptor, when threatened...
...wouId e<ix</ipand its coIIar and
emit a high-pitched noise...
...to frighten off predators.
Mr. Lewis?
What kind of noise?
Just a high-pitched,
intimidating noise.
But Iike how?
WeII, we don't know for sure.
But in my head,
can I see you for a moment?
Yes, sir?
I need to taIk to you
about your midterm e<i>x</i>am.
-I'm afraid I had to faiI you.
-Why?
WeII, you need % to pass.
-What did I get?
What happened, Ned?
Maybe you can cut me some sIack.
I'm sort of in Iove.
I'm sorry, but that's
reaIIy not my probIem.
I'm in Iove with you.
That brings me in the Ioop a IittIe.
That's why I did so bad on this test.
and you're teaching...
...and your face gets aII serious....
You Iook so good. When you wear that
tight IittIe turtIeneck sweater--
I'm your teacher. I'm sorry.
You're a student.
And I Iike women.
In spite of what may be written
on the backs of these chairs.
That guy at the counter's
-Go for it.
Phoebe, I'm engaged.
I'm saying, get his number,
just in case.
But if ChandIer's in an accident
...he'd want you to take a Iover to
to taIk to your friend.
You shouId be embarrassed.

You're up against the guy who

You'II probabIy get it.
But you shouId start practicing

-How'd your date go with Jake?
Great. We couIdn't keep

Stop it. You're getting me

I'II never sIeep with anyone eIse!
-Are you just reaIizing this now?
-No. Maybe. Yes!
I'm so busy pIanning the wedding,
a guy ever had a crush on you?
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
A kid in my cIass said
he's in Iove with me.
Whoa!
-Whoa, what?
-Ross has a boyfriend!
I do not have a boyfriend.
There's a guy in one of my cIasses
-Yeah.
Last year, EIizabeth, now this kid....
What is it?
Am I giving out some kind of...
...se<i>x</i>y-professor vibe?
Not right now.
The point is, my naturaI charisma has
made him faiI his midterm.
Now I feeI bad for the kid.
I had a crush on a teacher once,
I bIushed every time he Iooked at me.
You remember what it's Iike
to be   and in Iove.
-I can cut him some sIack.
-Yeah.

Bye!
-Bye!
-I'II miss you!
I'II miss you too!
We said goodbye at the door
You don't have to tiptoe around me.
I've thought about it.
You know what?
I'm okay, not having that
new-reIationship feeIing.
-I miss you aIready!

I'II be with ChandIer the rest

Come sit down. We're taIking

They're about to give out my award.
Oh, weII, I was in the bathroom,

Got your gracious-Ioser face?
Try to remember, if you win,
you have to hug me.

...and think I won it.
Joey, it says
You have to take it back.

[ENGLISH]
Oh, hey! How was your audition?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
What are you doing?
Practicing blowing you off.
- What's it for?
A big-budget period movie
about three Italian brothers...
...who come to America at the
turn of the century. It's classy.
The director's supposed to be
the next Martin Scorsese.
This guy's right after him.
Hello?
Joey, it's Estelle. I just talked to
the casting people. They loved you!
They loved me!
They want to see you again tomorrow.
- My God!
- There's just one thing.
Do you have a problem
rent a movie without it!
Oh.
Okay, let me call you back.
- What's the matter?
- They want me naked in the movie.
- Wow!
- I know.
- My grandmother's gonna see this.
and Monica's Cousin
The wedding's so close.
Are you nervous?
Yeah, but I also can't
wait till it's over.
We have a pact not to have sex
every woman in America.
Will you give me a hand
making up the guest bedroom?
Cousin Cassie's staying with us
for a few days.
Cassie? I haven't seen her
a Barbie everywhere?
- She's  years old.
- So? I still...
You're probably right.
Pheebs, can I talk to you
over here for a second?
Subtle, guys.
What?
I know you're planning my
Just play along, at least.
Okay. Sorry.
We have to throw her a shower?
What'd you decide to do
about the movie?
I don't know. I mean...
It's not like it's porn.
This is a serious, legitimate movie.
Nudity's really important
actors do nude scenes.
The chance to star in a movie?
Come on!
That's true. And I'm only naked in
one scene. It sounds really great.
My character's Catholic. He falls
in a big rainstorm.
We go into a barn, undress each other
and hold each other.
It's really sweet and tender.
Plus, everyone will see your thing!
When can we have this shower?
She has so much going on,
we have only two options.
- We have Friday.
- Yesterday.
If we make it yesterday, we're done!
It's impossible.
We can't do this by Friday.
We have to find a place,
invite people, get food.
There's too much to do.
- We cannot do it!
I'm sorry.
Just calm down, woman!
Phoebe, I already did.
All right, then I need to calm down.
I think we can do this
if we just get organized.
We have two days to plan this party.
We need to make fast decisions.
Where will we have it?
- Here. What time?
- Great! Very Monica.
- And chili!
- You went one too far.
- Flowers or balloons?
- Both.
- We're paying for this.
- Lusts of the Flesh!
- What?
- I don't know. Cowboy theme?
I'm glad we decided not to sleep
together before the wedding.
Oh, boy. Me too.
I was thinking, say we had a big fight,
bossy and domineering?
The wedding's off,
sloppy and immature.
That's me. Come on.
Wait. Cassie's in the guest room.
We're going to lunch.
Get rid of her, obsessive and shrill!
Shrill? The wedding is back on.
I thought I heard voices.
- Nice to meet you too.
- So, ready to go?
- Yeah.
- Chandler?
- I'll be right with you.
- Cassie needs to stay at your place.
can't stop staring at her.
Chandler, she's our cousin!
I wasn't staring.
I was listening intently.
It's called being a good
conversationalist. Watch.
Say something.
You were staring about eight inches
is she coming to the wedding?
Wafer-thin ice.
Hey, I'm back.
Hi, Joey.
Will I read the same scene again?
I tried to call you.
You didn't need to come today.
Oh, great.
I'd have been perfect for this part.
You made a bad decision and
ruined your movie. Good day!
You didn't need to come, because the
a little improv there. Yeah!
So, you were saying?
The director wants to meet you
tomorrow.
Wow! Sure! That's great.
Your agent said you're okay
with nudity.
Yeah, sure. As long as
everything in the movie's authentic.
In your love scene with Sarah...
...she talks about how she's never
seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish.
So...
So... what?
So, the director is insisting
that whoever play that part...
...be authentically, anatomically...
...not Jewish.
at this time would not be...
Bar mitzvah-ed?
Think  years earlier, lose the rabbi,
add a scalpel.
- To get this part, you can't be...
- No.
But you are?
- You told them you weren't?
There's nothing there to work with?
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know. I just want this part.
They say no matter what you're asked
during an audition, say yes.
They want you to ride a horse,
a horse. This is like learning...
...to grow a turtleneck.
I know, okay? Tomorrow,
when I go meet the director...
...I have to take my clothes off so
they can see what my body looks like.
Oh, my God. What are you gonna do?
I have to call my agent
be something we could...
...fashion.
- Like what?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.
Off the top of my head,
I'm thinking...
...double-sided tape
favors for the shower.
We get mahogany boxes
and carve everyone's names in them.
Then inside is each person's
individual birthstone.
Okay. Okay.
You take care of that.
Meanwhile, the party's tomorrow
Me. Are you?
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?
I'm making something for Joey.
Can I raid your fridge?
Have at it.
All right. Turkey? That won't work.
Cheese? That won't work.
Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Are you making him a sandwich?
No, it's more like a wrap.
Okay, so I'm gonna go, guys.
So you can get back to deciding on
We have a guest list.
You're amazing. Did you pull
that out of her purse?
Uh-huh. And a little seed money
for the party.
Cassie?
Hey, Ross!
It's been so long!
Last time I saw you...
...you were setting up your tent
Because it seemed like you didn't.
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- It's okay. Come on in.
Thanks for letting me stay here.
Monica's place was nice.
But her fianc sure stares a lot.
Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler!
I have a knack for impressions.
Maybe after we get re-acquainted
- Thank God.
The last time we hung out was when
our parents rented that beach house.
Remember the time I pinned you down
and tickled you until you cried?
We're probably too old to do that now.
I'll always remember that summer.
that we are related.
You know, we're not just
two random people thrown together.
We share genetic material.
It took you that long
to figure it out?
I'm a little slow.
Just as our children would be.
- Hi.
Thanks for coming.
Thank you. So nice to see you.
- No, thanks.
- Okay. Hey, Rach?
- Yeah?
- Who the hell are all these people?
I don't know.
show up on  hours' notice.
There's a word for people like that
Losers.
Hi, I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe.
I'm the maid of honor.
- How do you know Monica?
doing her taxes the last four years.
That's great.
- When is Monica supposed to get here?
- I don't know.
Excuse us.
- You didn't tell her?
- You were supposed to.
You were supposed to tell her to come!
- And please tell her to bring a cake!
We have a lot of options. A number
of prototypes for you to try on.
Those look great.
Okay, this one's a mushroom cap.
This one is made of bologna.
- The toothpicks?
but perishable.
Over here, we have pink suede,
which is nice.
But if it gets wet, it'll shrink.
Maybe we'll just
take that one away.
I also did a little something in fur,
get a better idea of what works.
Thanks, you are such a good friend.
And this is so weird.
Okay, the taffy's too sticky.
I was afraid of that.
- Toothpick?
- Yeah.
- What are you trying now?
- Delicious.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We have a winner!
What? Which one?
The Silly Putty.
Not so silly anymore!
She's your cousin.
your head, she'd think you were sick.
Or would she?
Let's back up for a second.
She was the one who suggested
opening a bottle of wine.
She was the one who
Logan's Run...
...the sexiest movie ever.
I know that look.
Forget it. I want it. She wants it.
I'm going in.
What the hell are you doing?
Say something clever.
Okay, doesn't have to be clever.
Just has to be words. Say some words.
Any words will do.
Oh, my God, this is the longest...
...that anyone has not talked ever!
There is nothing you could say
to make this worse...
...so just say something!
I haven't had sex in a very long time.
Yeah, you really shouldn't
have said anything.
Phoebe? Rachel? It's Monica.
I wonder what you could possibly
- For what?
First, for forgetting to
throw you a bridal shower.
Then, forgetting to invite you to it.
You already had it?
We called everyone in your phone book.
A bunch of people came.
It took us so long to get you here
and a great shower.
Now you don't have either.
We ruined everything.
No, wait a minute, that's not true.
What you did was really sweet.
- It kind of works out for the best.
- What do you mean?
Now I get to spend my shower
talking to people I don't even like!
- Surprise.
- Surprise, Monica.
What's cool is, the character
is from Naples, right?
My whole family's from Naples.
That's great. Okay. I've heard
- Hey, right. Not a problem.
I totally understand you need...
...to make sure I don't have any
horrible scars or tattoos.
Don't you worry.
I have nothing to hide.
So, there you go. That's me.
One hundred percent natural.
I tell you, that has never
happened before.
Cassie, are you finding
letting me stay here.
Oh, it's no problem.
What?
Say something. Say anything.
Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
Out of all of us, who do you think
will get married next?
Probably Monica and Chandler.
Could I have a pack of Newport Lights?
We don't sell cigarettes,
but they do across the street.
That'd be great. Thanks.
Melissa Worbert. I don't think
for seven sorority newsletters.
What's up with you?
Why don't I tell you over here?
So last I heard
you were gonna get married.
Poor Ray-Ray.
Oh, no. It's all good.
- I actually work at Ralph Lauren.
- Shut up!
I will not. I'm the divisional head
Are you friends with Ralph?
- Oh, please.
- Are you?
No.
We have to have dinner.
What are you doing tomorrow?
- Tomorrow. I don't know.
This has been so great.
Oh, there you are.
You're a bad man for giving me these.
- So listen, just call me. Here's my card.
- Oh, wow, thanks.
- You're in real estate?
and make a difference.
What do you do now?
I'm a party planner.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.
Look who's back. It's Ray-Ray.
That was my friend, Melissa,
from college.
She seems really, really fun!
She's actually sweet,
She's not the one who you...?
Who you what? Who you what?
- Yes.
- Wow!
Wow, what? Who you what?
Oh, it's not a big deal.
They were lovers.
- What?
- What?
No, we weren't. It was nothing.
It was one night, senior year,
and you know, ended up...
...kissing for a bit.
So that's two of my wives.
Where are you going?
To bring her back here!
Ross, get the sangria!
The One With Rachel's Big Kiss
So this is where the band is.
And here's the bar.
And all these pins have people's names
with a Manhattan in my hand...
...talking to the cute bartender.
These pins aren't for playing,
are they?
The red are my guests,
and the blue are yours.
This is so sad.
is done. This is our wedding.
They all look like they're having fun
don't they?
So where are my parents gonna be?
Well, if this is the wedding hall...
...then your parents would be over here
at home in Queens.
They're not invited?
- Look, I thought parents were coming.
Your parents are coming.
Chandler's are coming.
Ross' parents are coming.
Ross' parents are my parents.
Well, see, parents are coming.
- We should invite them.
- You just want more blue pins.
Well, this is just sad.
All right. Maybe I can fit them in
- Get out of here!
These are our tuxedos. If you like
anything, we can make a deal.
Anything at all. But these are
the three that Monica pre-approved.
Thanks a lot for hooking me up.
And I want you to know that I want
- They are nice.
When celebrities are done with them,
they send them back.
- You mean like for award shows?
- Some of them.
They've been down the red carpet
You look fabulous!"
Might I suggest watching
a little more ESPN...
...and a little less E!
Okay. Who wore those?
- Well, this one's Tom Brokaw.
- Not bad.
This one is Paul O'Neill.
Who's that?
He plays for the Yankees.
Have it on in the background.
- This one was Pierce Brosnan.
- Pierce Brosnan?
Are you serious?
?
This is James Bond's tux? I have to
get married in James Bond's tux.
It's a pretty cool tux.
It's not just that. I would be
on Her Majesty's secret service.
A man who fears no one,
with a license to kill.
Would Monica let me wear this?
We should really learn
how to play the real way.
I like our way.
Chess!
- Nice move.
with tuxedos. Do you need one?
No, I'm not wearing a tux.
- What are you gonna wear?
- Multi-colored robes.
And maybe a hat.
- Does Monica know about this?
- No.
Can I please be there
You'll just hear my video camera.
- What? What's going on?
- Can I tell her?
Do you want what happened,
or Joey's lewd version?
- Joey's.
of telling Joey that one time...
...she and I, you know,
kissed a little bit.
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
- It did.
- Sure.
Hey. It happened.
It was senior year.
and a peck on the cheek.
Why are you taking this away from me?
Why is it so hard for you to believe?
Okay. I just didn't know
that you were a lesbian.
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian.
I'm just saying that this happened.
It just seems pretty wild.
I do lots of crazy things.
I mean, I got drunk
and married in Vegas.
To Ross.
If you don't believe me...
...just come with me to dinner tonight
and she'll tell you.
Okay. Because I can't picture it.
You should get inside my head.
Guess what I got for your wedding?
A freakishly thin date
But not just any tux.
Batman's tux!
- What?
- That's right.
Made expressly for Val Kilmer,
and worn by him in the hit film...
...that Batman film he was in.
You can't wear that.
- So?
So? If you wear that,
it'll make mine less special.
You need something
to make this day special?
Hello! You have
Pretty please?
"Pretty please?" Not very .
If you were getting married,
I'd never do anything to upset you.
- You slept with my sister.
- That was pretty .
Okay, good, you're here.
add your parents...
...and make them into  tables of .
And I called the caterer.
We are good to go!
Yeah. They're not coming.
What?
They think that you only
invited them because of me.
They feel unwanted.
That's too bad.
you want them there.
This is a woman
who has sent you many lasagnas.
No, she hasn't.
Is it her fault
if some didn't make it to you?
What am I gonna say?
Tell them you mixed up invitations.
And the Irish.
But I don't think
you could blame it on them.
Hello? Yeah, hi. Mrs. Tribbiani?
This is Monica Geller.
I'm just calling to say that we really
weren't delivered.
I guess there was some screw-up
at the damn post office.
Tell me about it!
Yeah, the U.S. Post Office?
No. More like U.S. Lost Office.
What are they, Irish?
Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've
when I became a party planner.
He was actually planning a party
for his girlfriend at the time.
Oh, well.
- He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
- That's great.
- Were you ever in a sorority?
But they had to shut us down...
...when Regina Phalangie
died of alcohol poisoning.
Isn't it a shame when one girl
ruins it for the whole bunch?
Anyway...
Speaking of drinking too much,
Sigma Chi luau where we made out.
What?
Remember we... Come on, we had sarongs
on and the coconut bikini tops.
We went back to the house
and got really silly...
...and we made out.
Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea
his identity secret for a long time.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo
that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.
Batman is so much cooler
than James Bond.
- What?  has all those gadgets.
- Batman has the Batmobile.
-  gets all the ladies.
- Batman has Robin.
We get ESPN, right?
How about you go put on your 
tuxedo, and I'll make you a martini?
I don't like martinis.
- A Yoo-hoo with a funny straw?
or the show starts at ?
"The show"?
Right, the wedding. Gotcha.
But weddings start
a little late, right?
Have you ever been
to one of my weddings?
Well, it's the same day
in the rest of the show... Wedding.
The wedding starts at .
Okay. I totally hear you.
How about this?
I vamp till they get there.
You'll "vamp"?
Like warm up the crowd.
Ask where they're from.
Because in Joey Tribbiani,
There's no one greater.
Oh, please, God. Don't vamp.
Okay, maybe I'll talk to Chandler.
And maybe he'd like to get married
at  o'clock.
All right. I will give you
 extra minutes. That is it.
That's great! Thank you so much.
Well, we're in luck.
it's way too big.
Oh, that's okay.
The pants are way too small.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
You cannot wear that.
Now this means Ross is gonna be
I never thought I would say.
Dude, take that thing off.
You look like a fool.
Come next door. I got some minister
headdresses I want you to see.
How can you not remember us kissing?
I don't know. I don't remember
porch? We couldn't stop giggling.
Our coconuts kept knocking together.
Somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
I don't want
to make you uncomfortable...
...but I told Phoebe it happened,
and she doesn't believe me.
I'm sorry. I mean, if I thought
to me while I was sleeping.
No!
- All right.
- Okay, fine.
You don't have to admit it
because I know that it happened.
Okay!
You have to admit it!
I believe you.
If you say you kissed Melissa,
then you kissed Melissa.
- Thank you, Phoebe.
- Okay.
- But she didn't.
something of a conversation piece.
- Between you and...?
- Gunther.
Why don't we put them on?
Get a picture of Batman
and James Bond, together.
I would,
I could see  and  in those things.
Well, that stinks.
I was looking forward to wearing
our celebrity tuxes together.
- So you're not gonna be wearing yours?
- Are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!
Let me try it on.
Okay. But just the jacket.
the At First Sight premiere?
Val Kilmer didn't
wear this in Batman.
He wore it to the premiere of a fruity
love story where he was a blind guy.
Let me see that.
Oh, man.
The only super power you have is the
Whatever you want, you can have it.
You want to sing a song or do a dance?
You want your mom at the altar
screaming racial slurs? I don't care.
I just want to thank you guys
for what you did for my parents.
They're so happy
me to wear for the ceremony!
I wear it like this when I
marry you guys. And then this...
...is for party time.
It happened.
I am telling you it happened.
It was great meeting you.
And, Rachel? I don't think
I've ever done in my life.
I won't let you take it away.
So if you don't remember that,
maybe you'll remember this...
Oh, my God. You love me.
What?
Of course I remember.
I think about it all the time.
I can still hear
didn't think you'd return my love...
Look who's being suddenly shy.
You have to feel what I feel.
Nobody can kiss that good
and not mean it.
I'm just a good kisser.
Shut up.
I'm sorry.
You don't have to be sorry.
I'm obviously kidding.
I'm not in love with you.
I'm not in love with her.
I don't hear coconuts
when I make love to my boyfriend.
Anyway, I gotta go.
A kiss goodbye?
No? Okay.
I mean, I had no idea
that that would...
What the hell was that?
Just wanted to see
what all the fuss was about.
- And?
rd time's a charm.
Look at you, all handsome.
- Whose is it?
- Does it matter?
All that matters
is that you look so handsome.
- Whose is it?
married in four weeks?
Four weeks, baby. Four weeks!
Do you realize you get
louder each week?
There's still so much to do!
Have you written your vows yet?
I figured I'd just buy those.
when it comes to the wedding.
- Right. Have you written yours yet?
- No, but I know what I'm gonna say.
Do you happen to know exactly
what I'm gonna say?
Let's do it now. It won't be hard.
Say what's in your heart.
Look at her go. She must love me
Don't open that door.
The One With The Vows
"Monica, there are no words..."
There are no words!
This shouldn't be this hard!
You've done this before.
What did you say in your vows?
With Carol, I promised never to love
say. You should have seen her writing.
What's the emergency?
You have to help me. I'm supposed
to write my vows and all I have is this.
I like the pretty drawing of you
in the wedding dress.
Except your breasts look kind of small.
Those are my eyes!
- Those are my breasts.
with something simple, like
"Monica, from the moment I met you,
I knew I loved you."
I'm not sure I can do that.
Everyone, this is Chandler.
Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Maybe you could start with:
"Chandler, even though
that always knew I wanted more."
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust.
I'm the last man on earth.
Would you go out with me?
Are we allowed to lie in the vows?
Maybe you don't talk about
your feelings back then.
Just say something about all the things
the basic erogenous zones.
You got one, two, three...
...four, five...
...six and seven.
There are seven?
- That's one?
- Kind of an important one.
I was looking at it upside down.
Well, you know, sometimes that helps.
Okay, now, start out
with a little one...
...a two, a one-two-three...
...a three, a five...
...a four, a three-two...
...two, a two-four-six.
Two-four-six, four, two...
...two, four-seven...
...five-seven, six-seven...
...seven, seven...
...seven, seven, seven, seven, seven...
...seven!
I got it!
over our time together..."
- Yeah?
- I can't do everything.
Look back over your time together.
Oh, look, twins!
No fair! I don't even have one,
how come they get two?
- You'll get one.
what do you say you and I have one?
Why wouldn't I be married
when I'm ?
Oh, no. No, I just
meant hypothetically.
Hypothetically, why won't I
fundamentally un-marriable about me?
Well?
Dear God, this parachute
is a knapsack!
I'm getting married today!
Do you think he knew I was here?
Nice try.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Look, Monica...
- This is not gonna work.
- I bet this will work.
You are so great! I love you.
What?
Nothing! I said, you're so great,
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't!
- You love me!
- No, I don't!
Stop it! Stop it!
You know, I was thinking,
all the time.
Doesn't make any sense.
Okay.
What if we live together,
and you understand what I'm saying?
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Oh, my God!
Chandler...
...in all my life...
...I never thought
I would be so lucky...
...as to fall in love with my best...
My best...
- There's a reason why girls don't do this!
or where I said it.
Then I realized the only thing
that matters is that you...
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.
And if you let me...
...I'll spend the rest of my life
We're dying out here!
Come in! Come in!
- We're engaged!
- Yes!
- Hi.
- What have you guys been up to?
We were helping Chandler write
inappropriate suggestions.
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass"
inappropriate?
How's Monica doing?
Let's say it's lucky she's got a sweet ass
because she's not so good at the writing.
I can't believe in four weeks
end in divorce.
Phoebe, that's not true.
Yeah, you're right. How's the missus?
I can't believe they've
been together  years.
That long?
Maybe it seems like less because
they hid it from us for so long.
Hey, it's me. Coming in.
I've had a very long, hard day.
- I'm gonna get some chicken. Want some?
He kept asking if I wanted chicken.
Chicken?
I could eat some chicken.
Hey, Joe!
Can I get a three-piece, some coleslaw
and some beans and a Coke?
Diet Coke.
- I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
- It's not like we weren't cool about it.
You? And you?
You cannot tell. No one knows.
How? When?
- It happened in London.
want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!
- I have to tell someone.
- No, no!
- You can't.
- Please!
We don't want to deal with telling
Rachel I'm doing laundry for a few hours.
Laundry? Is that my new nickname?
You know what your nickname is,
Mr. Big...
Oh, look, there's Monica and Chandler.
Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!
Chandler and Monica!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my eyes! My eyes!
- Phoebe! Phoebe!
- It's okay! It's okay!
- No! They're doing it!
I know! I know!
- You know?
so you have to stop screaming!
- Hey, what's going on?
- Oh, hi!
What? What?
Oh, God! We're just so excited that
you might get this apartment!
- Actually, it looks really good.
and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but you know what? It
doesn't matter who knows what.
Now enough of us know,
that we can just tell them we know.
Now all the lying and the secrets
and have a little fun of our own.
All right, we better go if we're gonna
catch that movie.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.
Did you see that? With the
that she's attracted to me?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, she knows about us!
- Phoebe knows about us!
- Well, I didn't tell them.
Them? Who's them?
Phoebe and Joey.
Joey!
And Rachel.
I would've told you,
messing with us!
But, see, they don't know that we know
that they know.
- So...
- Ah, yes!
The messers become the messees!
Oh, my God, he wants me to come over
- Joey!
- They know you know.
- I knew it!
I cannot believe those two!
They thought that they could mess with
us? They're trying to mess with us?
They don't know that we know
She wants me to put lotion on her!
She's bluffing!
She's not backing down.
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.
Oh, man. Aren't you guys done yet?
The sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler,
- Okay.
Okay, show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.
Wow! You didn't rip off any buttons.
It's not my first time.
You go back out there
and seduce her till she cracks.
Okay, give me a second.
- Did you clean up in here?
we're gonna have all the sex.
You should be. I'm very bendy.
- I'm gonna kiss you now.
- Not if I kiss you first.
I guess there's nothing left
for us to do but kiss.
Here it comes.
Our first kiss.
- Okay, okay, okay, fine, you win!
- Why not?
- Because I'm in love with Monica.
- You're what?
Love her! That's right, I love her!
I love her!
I love you, Monica.
I love you too, Chandler.
I thought you guys were doing it.
Everybody knows.
- Well, actually, Ross doesn't.
- We'd appreciate if no one told him yet.
No.
What are you doing?
Get off my sister!
Your friends getting married,
it's gotta change things.
You think it'll be that different?
How could it not be?
who have kids.
And maybe they'll leave the city...
...to be near a Volvo dealership.
Things change.
But I don't want them
to move to a Volvo dealership.
It'll be okay, Joe.
Sorry. I just...
I like things the way they are.
Who's this little naked guy?
That little naked guy would be me.
Look at the little thing.
Yes.
Yes, fine, that is my penis.
- Got me.
That's Nana right there in the middle.
- Wow.
- Let's see.
"Me and the gang at Java Joe's."
Monica, you look like your grandmother.
How old was she there?
Let's see, .
Yeah, , .
Looks like a fun gang.
Look, look, look!
- What's going on?
Well, we were just talking about...
...you guys getting married
and how great it is.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo.
If that's what you really want.
That's so sweet.
- So we both finished our vows.
and he doesn't hear mine.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Funny one! That's good!
Monica, will you marry me?
What? I don't get it.
Oh, yeah!
- Man, this is hilarious!
- Chandler!
Don't worry, honey.
We'll make yours funnier.
Okay, what do you guys think?
- Dude...
- Dude!
How did you write this?
I stole Monica's
and changed the name.
- You can't do that!
- If he goes first, he can!
﻿
I think I'II go with the chicken piccata
you know, for me?
Yes. DefiniteIy.
What is it?
Dancing.
-Hey.
-Hey.
I saw the Porsche parked out front.
Can I get the keys?
Thought I'd take that bad boy for a spin.
Ross drives it? When I ask, you say
so sIow he couId never hurt it.
It's a car, Monica, not a rocket ship.
Just repIace the buIbs in the
brake Iights after you're done.
-Hey.
-Hi.
Saw the Porsche. Looking good.
-I've never driven it. Not once.
Okay, once.
Okay, I drive it aII the time.
So much for the ''you-can-drive-it
but-don't-teII-RacheI'' pIan.
Wow, I can't beIieve you Iied to me.
Now we're even.
I won't Iet you drive the Porsche
because you're a terribIe driver.
There. That wasn't about the wedding.
If you want a ride in the Porsche,
I'II take you around the bIock.
You got a coupIe hours?
The One With ChandIer's Dad
Whew, that was a brisk ride.
-Take the top down, did you?
I'm an e<i>x</i>ceIIent driver.
You're fast and irresponsibIe.
That adds up to a bad driver.
In high schooI, that added up
to head cheerIeader.
Did you see the Iook
in the bad boy.
-She's checking out your beehive.
-What?
-Give me a brush.
-The keys.
-No way!
a comb on the fIoor of the bathroom.
AIimony.
We stiII haven't gotten
an RSVP from your dad.
Oh, right. Maybe that's because I
didn't send him an invitation.
Why not?
An invitation?
He shouId be at our wedding.
I was gonna send him an invite
but then I saw the stamp.
It was one of those MariIyn Monroe stamps
and I thought:
My dad has that dress.
Wow. That must be a very different view
''Happy Birthday, Mr. President.''
We have to invite him.
I don't even know the man.
I haven't seen him in years.
And when he finds out
he wasn't asked?
We don't run in the same circIes.
I hang out with you guys and he...
...stars in a drag show in Vegas.
I think I want to trade circIes.
You don't want him there.
is wearing a backIess dress.
So what? As Iong as he's not wearing
a white dress and veiI, I don't care.
I think I need to do some shopping.
Nice.
My God!
-What do you think you're doing?
-Just washing the windshieId.
There's no way I'II Iet you
-No.
Why don't you just hand over the keys.
Oh!
Do not start this car.
Okay, okay.
I wiII give you  bucks...
...if you get out of this car
right now. Hey!
Look.
If you're so freaked out,
-In the death seat?!
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, sweetie.
-Ready to go?
-My purse is at Monica's. I'II be back.
-Wait a minute.
-Over a month.
We ought to get
to know each other better.
-Sure. I'd Iike that.
-Yeah. So, uh....
What's your name?
-It's Jake.
-Yeah, big fan.
Me too. There's a game on Tuesday.
Do you want to go?
Great! Let me make sure I'm not
doing anything Tuesday.
Here.
-What's this?
No more stupid wedding stuff.
No more these fIowers, these fIowers.
Think of the money we'II save.
We're not eIoping. I Iove the fIowers.
Can our wedding be bigger, pIease?
We're going to see your dad.
I want to get to know
Honey, just so you know....
Now that you're marrying me,
you don't get to win anymore.
Forget it. I don't want to go.
I don't want to see him.
I know your dad embarrassed you.
AII kids are embarrassed
for what I went through.
In high schooI,
he came to aII my swim meets...
...dressed as a different
HoIIywood starIet.
It's hard enough to be  .
You're skinny, you're wearing Speedos
There's your dad cheering you on.
Dressed as Carmen Miranda,
wearing a headdress with reaI fruit...
...that he wiII Iater hand out
to your friends as a heaIthy snack.
But he was there!
My dad didn't come
of your swim meets, cheering you on.
That's a pretty great dad.
He had se<i>x</i> with Mr. GaribaIdi.
-Who's Mr. GaribaIdi?
-Does it matter?!
You're not   anymore, okay?
Maybe it's time you Iet that stuff go.
If he's not at your wedding,
-How much did you ever win before?
You know how when you're wearing pants
and you Iean forward...
...I check out your underwear?
WeII, when Jake did it...
...I saw that he was wearing
women's underwear.
I know. They were mine.
Oh!
No, no, wait. That's weird.
We were goofing around,
-That's kind of hot.
I think so too. And that IittIe fIap?
It's great for hoIding my Iipstick.
I wouIdn't know about that.
Jake says that women's underwear
is actuaIIy more comfortabIe.
He Ioves how siIk feeIs
are good for his posture.
There's nothing wrong with Jake.
He is aII man.
I think more than you.
He Iooked Iike a reaI Iumberjack
in those pink Iacies.
I'm just saying onIy a man compIeteIy
I don't think you couId.
-I am secure with my mascuIinity.
-Okay, whatever.
You've seen my huge stack of porn, right?
Here you go.
Look aII you want.
There's nothing there.
SIow down,
over the speed Iimit.
I'm driving  miIes over the Iimit.
They raised it by  .
What, are they crazy?!
God, I forgot how much I Iove driving.
I have got to get my Iicense renewed.
You don't have a vaIid driver's Iicense?
PuII over right now.
Ross, you're so tense.
Just need to reIa<i>x</i>.
What are you--? That's not funny.
Stop horsing around.
I am not horsing around, okay?
I am ''Porsche-ing'' around.
Uh-oh.
Stay caIm. Nothing wiII happen.
You're not in that much troubIe.
ReaIIy? You think so?
I was taIking to myseIf.
-You're straight. I get it.
If we caIIed your dad,
we'd have better seats.
I don't want him to know we're here yet.
I'm not ready for that.
Besides, he won't be too happy
a Iot the Iast few years.
What?
Yeah. He's made phone caIIs,
written Ietters.
He came to New York.
But I aIways said I was too busy.
It's very ''Cats in the CradIe.''
<i>welcome the incomparable...</i>
<i>...Helena Handbasket.</i>
HeIIo, darIings.
And there's Daddy.
Switch pIaces with me. Come on!

-Yep.
I knew it. I knew it!
-You won't speed anymore, right?
-I promise.
In the meantime, Iet him drive.
Does he have a Iicense?
-Can he handIe a stick?
-WeII....
I can handIe a stick!
-That can't be your father.
-What?
That's Mr. GaribaIdi
pIaying the piano.
HeIIo, and weIcome to the show.
I see some of our reguIars
in the audience.
And a coupIe of irreguIars.
-He's coming into the audience.
You're invisibIe now.
-Where are you from?
-BakersfieId.
-I'm sorry?
-BakersfieId.
No, no, I heard. I'm just sorry.
It can't happen Iike this.
So earIy in the show.
Turn around, darIing.
Let me see your pretty face.
Can we have our drinks, pIease?
Waiter? --tress?
-Hey, Pheebs.
ManIy, and aIso kind of a sIut.
I'm beginning to see what Jake

The siIk feeIs reaIIy good.
And things aren't as smashed down

That's great.
You have so many more choices
And the fabrics cotton, siIk, Iace.
You know what I've aIways
wondered about? Pantyhose!
The way they start at your toe,
then they go aII the way up to--
-I shouId go take these off, shouIdn't I?
fascinating parents.
Oh, they're a hoot.
And who is your friend?
I'm Monica.
-Monica. Where are you from?
-New York.
I'm not very fond of New York.
Queens, I Iike.
What is this...
...sparkIing something, honey, huh?
ActuaIIy, Monica and I are engaged.
ReaIIy?
CongratuIations.
When's the big day?
In two weeks.
I see.
WeII, I wish you both

So, you're baId.
Wait, wait.
We'd Iove it if you couId be there.
ReaIIy?
I know it wouId make me happy...
...ma'am.
Then I wouIdn't miss it for the worId.
I'm getting aII misty here.
-Yeah.
Thanks for making me do this.
Before we go on with the show,
I want to say to the bride and groom...
...how Iucky they are
to have found each other.
In every Iife a IittIe rain must faII.
FortunateIy...
...in my Iife....
When I was growing up,
for today.
Remind me to introduce you
to someone.
-Who?
-Fourth gear.
What does he want?
from the   and  position.
Maybe it's Sergeant Sagittarius
coming back to fIirt some more.
Perhaps he didn't tarnish
the badge enough.
It's a different guy.
-Good evening, officer.
have been more than .
You're right. It was .
ReaIIy?
-Can I see your Iicense, pIease?
-You're kidding.
You're not gonna give me a ticket
for driving too sIow, are you?
That's right.
You wanna heIp me out here?
I'm sorry, what?
Can you do your IittIe thing
to tarnish his badge.
You know, officer....
I had the weirdest dream Iast night.
Oh, my God!
Your Iicense, pIease.
You don't want to hear
about my dream...
...Officer...
...Pretty?
It's Petty.
I'II be right back with your ticket.
-You have a son.
-I know. I know.
-You feeI better?
about my manhood or anything...
...but I think I need to hook up
with a woman right now.
I understand.
You Iook famiIiar. Do I know you?
I don't think so.
Maybe it's because I'm on teIevision.
-I'm an actor on <i>Days of our Lives.</i>
-Wow. ReaIIy?

-But you're stiII my friend?
-Not for a few minutes.
-Right now, are you stiII my best man?

But as her oIder brother,
If you ever hurt my IittIe sister...

So I can be prepared.
-What are they?

I'm responsibIe for aII those.
I had to go with the odds.
Remember that audition I had a whiIe ago
and I didn't get the part?
-The commerciaI?
-That pIay?
That other pIay?
-The movie?
who fIies pIanes?
No. But, man, that one hurt.
-This is the one about WWI soIdiers.
-Oh, yeah.
Back then we caIIed it
''The Great War.''
It reaIIy was.
The guy they wanted backed out!
-I'II be done by then.
Oh. Then way to go,
you big movie star!
See you. I'm off

Wait, Joey. We fought the Nazis
Go! Go!
Who did we fight in WWI?
-Me<ix</iico?
-Yes. Very good.

What'II we do?
Potatoes and some pasta.
Hang on.
Joey, you keep touching your face.
Something wrong?
No. No.
I thought it might be
a cooI character thing.
He's a face toucher.
I don't think so.
Let's take it back
but we stiII have food.
Potatoes, pasta...
...and a few tins of tuna!
Honey, we gotta go!
Here's a <iq</iuestion
Can my dad borrow one of your
pearI neckIaces?
Did he say what kind of neckIine
but I'm guessing...
...pIunging?
He is more of a if-you've-got-it-
fIaunt-it kind of father.
Let me see if RacheI has anything.
Yes, incIude more peopIe in this.
Do you reaIize that at this time tomorrow
we're gonna be getting married?
I have a date tomorrow night.
-I can't beIieve we made it.
-What?
WeII, honestIy?
Ever since we got engaged...
...I've been waiting for something
to fIip you out.
HonestIy? Me too.
-ReaIIy?
wiII come up and I'II go aII....
WeII, ChandIer.
-But nothing has.
-I'm so gIad.
Thank you for staying
so caIm during this.
It's made me stay caIm.
I couId've been worse.
I'II be right there.
<iyou've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing.</i
<i>Please leave a message for...the Bings!</i>
Hey, Maureen! Hi!
-This is my cousin, Maureen.
-We're the Bings.
Hi! You guys Iook so beautifuI.
Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
Monica.
So you know, I had my
''oIder brother'' taIk with ChandIer.
What is that?
I toId him that if he ever hurt you...
...I wouId hunt him down
I'm serious.
I wouId kick his ass!
Ross, pIease, my makeup!
-ChandIer.
-Mom.
Thanks for wearing...something.
This is so e<ix</iciting! I thought we
screwed you up too much for this.
Just think, soon there wiII be
to get spit on again.
You're Iucky. At Ieast the peopIe
that spit on you are famous.
-Who spits on you?
-I don't want to taIk about work.
Mrs. Bing? These are my parents,
-Are you his mother or father?
Jack!
What? I've never seen one before.
Dad, there's Ross.
Go taIk to him.
I wasn't even abIe to act
Iike I'm okay with it.
HeIIo, aII.
Hi...Dad.
Hi, Mr. Bing.
-Nora.
-Yes.
AIthough we may be seeing
too much of some peopIe.
Aren't you a IittIe oId

Don't you have a IittIe too much penis
you want to.
Thanks, you guys.
-Rach, Rach?
-Yeah?
TaIk to ChandIer's dad and

-I'm Amanda.
-Oh, I get it.
''A man, duh!''
CouId I have your attention?
-I'm Ross GeIIer.
-Dr. Ross GeIIer.
Dad, pIease. As I was saying...
...I'm Dr. Ross GeIIer.
And I'm the best man.
And I have to say, I'm a IittIe surprised
who don't know ChandIer...
...he's not the biggest fan
of reIationships.
In fact, I think before he met Monica...
...the onIy reaI reIationship he had was
with a girI named MoIIy.
And he wouId've married her,
Did I say it was his dog?
Any-- Anyway....
This marriage is doubIy speciaI for me...
...because not onIy is the groom
my best friend...
...but the bride is my IittIe sister.
She's the greatest sister
a guy couId ask for.
PIease join me in raising a gIass...
...to the coupIe we're
-To the Bings!
How cooI is it that the ne<i>x</i>t time you see
ChandIer you'II be waIking down the aisIe?

Honey, it's not gonna be over.
happens to it?
-I'II do it.
-Who wants it? Anybody?
-I said, I'II do it.
-Nobody?
-AII right, I'II do it myseIf.
You were a big heIp tonight.
Thanks for heIping my grandmother
get to the hoteI safeIy.
-Of course! That's what I'm here for.
-Okay. Sorry.
What grandmother?
-Where have you been?
-Yeah.
-Nice shades.
-Thanks.
I figure if I wear these in my scenes,
I won't get spit in my eyes.
And, if I remember correctIy,
-AII right.
-Where's ChandIer?
-I think he's in RacheI's room.
ChandIer?
-Is Monica here?
-She's steaming her dress. Why?
-I think ChandIer's gone.
-''TeII Monica I'm sorry.''
Oh, my God.
What's up?
''TeII Monica I'm sorry.''
TeII her yourseIf.
Oh, my God.
ChandIer just Ieft, though?
Maybe it's not what we think.
Maybe it's:
''TeII Monica I'm sorry
I used her tweezers to pIuck my nose hair.''
He does that. I've seen him.
Or maybe he was writing to teII her
''TeII Monica I'm Sorry.''
-It means he freaked out and Ieft!
-Don't be so negative!
Good God, isn't it possibIe that
What are we gonna do?
I'm gonna have to go find him
and bring him back.
You make sure Monica
does not find out, okay?
But if you don't find him
and kick your ass!
I wiII find him.
WeII, the dress is done.
What?
We're just so happy for you.
That's so sweet!
Can we just take a minute and taIk about
the man I'm gonna marry tomorrow.
I mean, how Iucky am I?
That's a good <i>q</i>uestion.
I just hope that someday
you guys find someone Iike ChandIer.

Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.
-Just the Iast two pages.
-AII right.
I found the picture!
Picture? What picture?
The picture of my wife
I found in your pack.
-CouId you Iower the script?
so I can pIay off your reaction.
Okay, Iook.
I know you're great
and pIay aII those Shakespeare guys...
...but you're spitting
aII over me, man.
-Of course I am!
of a good actor.
And when you enunciate, you spit!
Didn't know that.
Thanks. Okay, check it out.
Picture? What picture?
-Gunther, have you seen ChandIer?
-No, I haven't seen him.
-Damn.
-He's getting married tomorrow, right?
Yes. Don't worry.
-I wasn't invited.
Then we'II see you
the day after tomorrow.
Mom? Dad?
What are you doing here?
We thought we'd see what
the fuss is aII about.
-I see why the girIs Iike coming here.
-She just added him to her Iist.
-What? Your Iist?
-Of peopIe we're aIIowed to sIeep--
I know what the Iist is.
Come on, sit down.
Have a cup of joe.
Dad, I can't. I'm sorry.
If you see ChandIer,
Iet her know I'm Iooking for her.
Action!
I found the picture!
What picture?
The picture of my wife, in your pack!
You went through my personaI property?
Why do you have a picture of PauIette
in your pack?
Because, Vincent, we were Iovers...
...for two years!
Cut! WonderfuI!
Great scene!
You were awesome. In that
Iast speech, you soaked me.
-Tomorrow's caII sheet.
-No, you gotta get me out of it.
I have pIans. Important pIans!
-Ross said stiII no word from ChandIer.
-Oh, man.
But they found the grandmother
wandering down th Avenue.
Okay, weII, there's one down.
I'm getting married today!
I cracked a rib, but I don't care.
This is too awfuI!
But she'II be in the gown
and then he won't show up...
...then she'II have
to take off the gown--
Stop it. You can't do this here.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just so sad.
PuII it together.
-I know. I know. Oh, God!
There's no tissue.
Can you grab me some toiIet paper?
Oh, that's gone too.
This is Monica's bathroom, right?
-I found one.
-Okay.
-Here you go.
if he doesn't show up.
Here's a whoIe bunch.
She'II be at the wedding waiting...
...and peopIe wiII be whispering,
''Oh, that poor girI.''
Then she'II have to come back here
and Iive aIone.
-Oh, my God.
garbage. And it's positive.
Monica's pregnant.
So I guess she won't be totaIIy aIone.
Oh, my God!
I know. Monica's gonna have a baby!
Can this count as her ''something new''?
Oh, my God.
Do you think this is why
ChandIer took off?
She had to have just taken that test.
I took out the trash Iast night.
It's turning into
and I'm stiII hoIding this.
Phoebe, we cannot teII anyone
about this.
-Right. Yeah.
-Okay?
Hey, wait. Do you know
This is hardIy a commerciaI for it.
Anything?
No. I taIked to Joey on the set.
He hasn't heard from him.
I taIked to ChandIer's parents again.
You said he was missing?
No. I made it seem Iike I caIIed to chat.
Pretty sure they both think
I'm interested in them.
-We've got to teII her he's gone.
to the pIaces I went Iast night.
How much time?
How Iong before she absoIuteIy
has to start getting ready?
-One hour.
-Give me two.
Then why do you ask?
-Wish me Iuck.
And, cIearIy, you suck at this.
I have documented night bIindness.
No, you don't!
Okay. But I don't suck!
See you Iater.
Do you know how
you're gonna staII her?
Because she is insane
about her scheduIe today.
-I'II figure something out.
and then do my hair.
Okay. But before you do that,
I need you to taIk to me.
About what?
I'm never gonna get married!
You wiII. The right guy's
just around the corner.
Okay, are we done with that?
No, I'm serious.
Maybe I shouId just forget about it.
if I sIept with Joey.
RacheI? Are you okay?
E<ix</icuse me, Aaron? I have
a IittIe probIem with the scheduIe.
I wasn't supposed to work today.
I have a wedding that I have to be at.
It's my best friend's
We can't stop fiIming just for you.
It's not Iike it's your wedding.
It is my wedding.
Did I not make that cIear?
You said your best friend
is getting married.
Yeah, to me.
Yeah, I'm marrying my best friend.
Isn't that beautifuI?
-But you said you were officiating.
-Happens more than you think.
I'm sorry, Joey. It's stiII no.
I'm having surgery.
What?
I made up the stuff about the wedding
because I didn't want you to worry.
But I'm having surgery today.
What kind of surgery?
TranspIant.
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
Hair transpIant.
But you're not baId.
It's not on my head.
There's nothing I can do.
You'II probabIy be out by  anyway.
We've just got one short scene,
Let's go, buddy!
We got a scene to shoot!
I'm wearing two beIts.
-Are you drunk?
-No.
Yes, you are!
AII right.
We are never gonna find him.
He's one guy in a huge city.
Oh, my God. Is that him?
That is an oId Chinese woman.
He couId be in disguise, you know.
You know what? You're right.
this aII wrong.
If you're ChandIer
and you want to hide...
...where is the Iast pIace on Earth
peopIe wouId think you'd go?
So this is your office.
How'd you guys find me?
-Panicking.
And using the Internet to try to prove
that I'm reIated to Monica.
-How is she?
-She doesn't know you're gone.
And she doesn't have to know.
-Why not?
Because if I go home,
we're gonna become the Bings.
I can't be the Bings.
What's wrong with it?
The Bings have horribIe marriages.
They yeII, they fight...
...and they use the pooI boy
Have you ever put on a bIack dress
-Then you are neither of your parents.
It's not just their marriage.
Look at yours. Look at everybody's.
OnIy PauI Newman
can make marriage work.
And I've met me.
None of my proceeds go to charity.
But Iook, ChandIer...
...right now no one has
a Iower opinion of you than I do.
But I totaIIy beIieve you can do this.
I want to. I Iove her so much,
but I'm afraid--
This is too huge.
You're right. It is huge.
So why don't we take it
Just forget about it.
Can you just come home
and take a shower?
WeII, yeah. But then--
We're just gonna go home
and take a shower.
That's not scary, right?
Depends on what you mean by ''we.''
-AII right!
with the homophobic jokes.
So, what do you say?
I'II shower,
but I won't promise anything.
Okay, that's aII we're taIking about.
Okay? Come on, Iet's go home.
Who's Mike Smith?
I was sure this was my office.
The nights are the hardest.
But then the day comes...
...and that's every bit as hard
-The days and nights are hard, I get it!
I have to start getting ready.
I'm getting married today.
I know. At dusk.
That's such a hard time for me.
I'm gonna put my makeup on.
We have to be at the hoteI in an hour.
-Wait!
I need you to remember...
...that we are aII here for you
and that we Iove you.
Okay, you're reaIIy freaking me out.
We can't find ChandIer--
--'s vest.
We can't find ChandIer's vest.
How can that be?
Wait, are you serious?
Found the vest.
We'II have to keep an eye on it,
''Oh, my God! The worst has happened!''
I wouId sooner die in this heIIhoIe
than see her back with you!
That can be arranged.
-Let's reset.
-What?! He got me!
Let's take it from there.
Are you a IittIe off today?
married in, Iike, an hour, okay?
And I'm the minister.
PIease, can you puII it together?
Of course. I'm sorry. I'd hate you to miss
anything Iike that on account of me.
-I can do this.
than see her back with you!
That can be arranged!
SIippery IittIe bugger!
So you two were married, huh?
What happened, you just drift apart?
Do you remember our wedding day?
Did you know I sIept with the best man?
Yes, he toId me.
At Ieast I think that was what he said.
It was difficuIt to understand
with his Iegs wrapped around my head.
Here comes the bride.
Oh, my God, Monica!
I want to wear this every day.
You Iook so beautifuI.
I'm so happy for me.
-HeIIo?
-Did ChandIer show up yet?
-We got him back. Everything's fine.
-I'm stiII on the set.
The wedding is in Iess than an hour.
I know. I'm sorry. The guy's drunk.
They won't Iet me go untiI we get this.
Oh, my God. I'm gonna
have to find another minister.
No, I'm the minister!
Look, put them both on the phone,
and me right now! I have the power!
There you go! You put on a tu<ix</iedo!
That wasn't scary, was it?
No.
I'm teIIing you,
just a IittIe bit at a time.
What's the ne<i>x</i>t IittIe bit?
Getting married.
You can do that too.
Just Iike you've done everything eIse.
Yeah, you're right. I can do that.
I just want some fresh air.
-Okay.
-Okay.
Oh, fresh air!
-Cover for me.
-Maybe you're overreacting. You do that.
We gotta do something.
Joey won't make it, so I'II Iook around
because they frown on that.
Okay.

E<i>x</i>ceIIent.
CongratuIations.

And ChandIer AcidophiIus.
Hi. Hi.
Hi.
Has anyone seen ChandIer?
-I thought he was with you.
-He was with me.
We're pIaying a IittIe game.
Hide-and-seek.
You can't ask us, son.
Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad.
He better not come here. He can't see
the bride in her wedding dress.
As I recaII, when we got married,
I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
That was after the wedding.
-Great.
He's doing great.
Don't you worry about ChandIer.
Are you okay?
WeII, you're sweating.
Out of happiness for you and ChandIer.
These are beads of joy.
That's sweet.
Don't touch me.
-Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
-Yeah.
-What's going on?
with someone you know is a fIight risk?
Aaron, you gotta Iet me go.
The guy's hammered.
I'm sorry. As Iong as he's here
and conscious, we're stiII shooting.
You wouIdn't happen to have

So I got your car. It's right outside.
Why? Are we done for the day?
That's what you toId me.
Thank you. You're weIcome.

Here we go.
Is that my ass?

UnIess you want

-What? TaIking about what?
what's going on right now....
What, you'II ''hi-yah''?
Monica's pregnant.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
And you're not freaking out?
I was. Then I went to the gift shop
because I was out of cigarettes.
-Cigarettes?
that's when I saw this.
And I thought, ''Anything
that can fit into this can't be scary.''
You obviousIy didn't see <iChucky III.</i
But come on, Iook at how cute
and smaII this is.
So I got it to give Monica
I knew you'd find him.
Our IittIe boy is getting married.
Look at you, so handsome.
You Iook beautifuI, Mom.
You Iook beautifuI too, Dad.
I Iove you both.
I'm so gIad you're here.
Are you ChandIer?

Let us begin.
DearIy beIoved--
That's my Iine!
I can take it from here. Thanks.
DearIy beIoved,
MemoriaI Day weekend, .
Let's get started before
the groom takes off again.
We are gathered here today...
...to join this man...
...and this woman
in the bonds of hoIy matrimony.
I've known Monica and ChandIer
for each other.
And now, as I've Ieft my notes
in my dressing room...
...we shaII proceed to the vows.
Monica?
-He took off?
find my prince.
My souI mate.
Then three years ago,
at another wedding...
...I turned to a friend for comfort.
And instead I found everything that
I'd ever been Iooking for my whoIe Iife.
And now...
...here we are...
...with our future before us.
And I onIy want to spend it with you.
My prince.
My souI mate.
My friend.
UnIess you don't want to.
You go.
ChandIer?
No, that's okay.
I thought this wouId be the most
that aisIe, I reaIized it's simpIe.
I Iove you.
Any surprises that come our way,
it's okay, because I wiII aIways Iove you.
You are the person I was meant
to spend the rest of my Iife with.
You want to know if I'm sure?
You may now kiss the bride.
I guess by the powers vested in me
husband and wife.
Oh, wait. Do you take each other?
-I do.
-I do.
Yeah, you do!
Rings.
Oh, crap. Okay.
Let's do the rings.
We good? Yeah? Good?
Once again...
...I pronounce you husband and wife.
Now kiss her again.
I Iove you.
And I know about the baby.
-What baby?
-Our baby.
We have a baby?
Phoebe found your pregnancy test.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Then who did?
Look at them.
And they're gonna have a baby.
