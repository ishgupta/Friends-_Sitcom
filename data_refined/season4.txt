Phoebe found out about this lady...
...who knew her parents,
<i>wouldn't date Chandler.</i>
<iI don't know what</i
<i>happened there either.</i>
<i>Ross' new girlfriend shows up.</i>
<iRachel gets Bonnie to shave her head.</i
happened there either.
Hold on.
Let me go get Chandler.
She's helping me.
My head's sunburned.
-Thanks a million.
you aren't in the mood?
No, she likes that.
Faking sleep doesn't work.
l've woken up many times with her--
-Why am l telling you?
-l don't know.
-Not every morning--
-Making it worse!
The One with the Jellyfish
You probably want to know
everyone lied their asses off.
No, it wasn't like that.
Remember how l said
Lilly, Frank and l were close?
We were very close.
How close?
The three of us were
kind of a couple.
l don't know how that would work.
l'm not asking!
Anyhow, somehow l got pregnant...
...and l was...
...scared.
Remember what it was like to be  ?
Mom killed herself
and my dad ran off.
l lived in a Gremlin with a guy
who talked to his hand.
l'm sorry. l thought l'd left you
till a few years ago.
By then, you were already grown-up.
You're here and l would
really like to get to know you.
Well, everybody does.
l'm a really cool person.
You had  years to find out,
but you didn't even try.
You walked out on me,
-Really?
No, because l'm not your boyfriend.
Hey, Pheebs, how'd it go?
My mom's friend, Phoebe,
is actually my birth mom.
l found a dried-up seahorse.
What do you mean?
My new mom,
who's a big fat abandoner.
Don't you want to stay here
your mom wasn't really your mom...
...and your new mom turned
out to be really hot?
Oh, man, huh?
But, it's your mom.
No, l'm talking about your mom.
lt's over.
Was it awful?
lt was long.
l didn't realize how late it was...
...till l saw the five o'clock shadow
on her head.
She didn't want to stay.
thinking about. About us.
Before we even think about us
getting back together...
...l need to know
how you feel about this stuff.
lt's : in the morning.
So l'd better get
Come up when you're done.
l'll be up...
...in   pages.
Front and back.
Very exciting!
What happened to you?
Why didn't you come up?
Done.
-You just finished?
-l wanted to be thorough.
This is clearly
every word carefully.
Twice.
Does it?
l'm sorry?
Does it?
Does it? Does it?
l wanted to give that whole
''Does it?'' part another glance.
What do you mean?
You said you read it twice.
lt either does or doesn't.
l have decided...
...that it...
...does.
-Are you sure?
-Sure, l'm sure!
There's a nuclear holocaust.
l'm the last man on earth.
Would you go out with me?
l've got canned goods.
Take a look at this!
Check this baby out!
lt hurts!
Can we help you to the house?
lt's two miles.
And l'm tired from digging.
Damn the jellyfish!
Damn all the jellyfish!
Do something.
There's only one thing.
What is it?
Pee on it.
Gross!
l saw it on Discovery Channel.
He's right.
There's ammonia in that...
...that kills the pain.
Forget it.
lt doesn't hurt that bad!
You can use my hole for privacy.
l'm ready to get
-Nothing. l don't know.
-What happened?
-Nothing.
-l'm going to shower.
-Me too.
Me too.
l'll put this in the car.
l have to go pack!
-And it really does?
for everything that went wrong.
She goes on for five pages
about how l was unfaithful to her.
We were on a break!
lf you say that one more time,
l'll break up with you.
This breakup was not all my fault.
something you can do? Does it?''
You have what you want.
You're back with her.
lf you bring this up now,
you'll wreck it.
Yeah, l know.
to forget this?
Sure, it's hard...
...but you don't have to talk about it.
A lot happened on that trip...
...that we should
never, ever talk about.
What happened on that beach?
lt's between us and the sea, Ross.
Hi, Ursula.
l know that we haven't talked
in a long time.
Our mom is not our birth mom.
in Mom's suicide note.
There was a suicide note?
Do you still have it?
Hang on.
l can't believe you didn't tell me
there was a suicide note.
Yeah, so how have you been doing?
Shut up!
''Goodbye, Phoebe and Ursula.
You read the poem, right?
All right. Hang on.
Pass the cheese, please.
You can't even look at me, can you?
lt's Phoebe!
We can talk to Phoebe!
l'm too depressed to talk.
l'll give you $   to talk to us.
What about making that
beach trip an annual thing?
What happened out there?
What? We took a walk.
Joey?
All right.
We swore we'd never tell.
They'll never understand.
We have to get it out.
lt's eating me alive!
-Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
-All right!
l got stung.
Stung bad.
l couldn't stand.
l couldn't walk.
We were two miles from the house.
We were scared and alone.
We didn't think we could make it.
l was in too much pain.
And l was tired from digging.
Then Joey remembered something.
l'd seen it on Discovery Channel.
Wait, l saw that.
On the Discovery Channel.
You don't know!
l thought l would pass out.
l tried, but l couldn't...
...bend that way.
That's right.
l stepped up.
She's my friend and she needed help.
lf l had to,
l'd pee on any of you.
Only...
...l couldn't.
l got the stage fright.
l wanted to help,
''Do it now. Do it. Do it now!''
Sometimes, late at night,
l can still hear the screaming.
Because l do it through my wall
to freak you out.
Maybe there's somebody
for people like us.
Yeah, no, there's this
guy Owen, he's the best.
Might have his card.
<i>And fuchsia and mauve</i>
<i>Those are the  colors of my bedroom</i>
l invite all of you to count
the colors in your bedroom.
Except for you.
l didn't regret giving you up.
Okay, bye.
l'm not done.
The reason l never
looked you up was because...
...l was afraid you'd react...
...just like the way
you're reacting now.
Can't we just start from here?
or have anything in common.
l don't know.
lt's not like...
...we don't have anything in common.
l mean, l like pizza.
l like pizza!
Wait, l like the Beatles.
Oh, my God!
So do l.
Puppies.
l'm kind of hungry.
Hey! Me too!
Uncanny.
lt looks like rain
and l don't have my umbrella.
Me neither. l really hate that.
Stop it. Now you're just
doing it to freak me out.
l missed you.
l missed you too.
l was so nervous about that letter.
But the way you
how much you've grown.
l suppose.
You have, Ross.
You should give yourself credit.
My mom never thought
this would work out.
She said, ''Once a cheater,
lost those four months.
But if time was what you needed
to gain a little perspective....
We were on a break!
-Coffeehouse?
-You bet.
lt took two people
you took full responsibility for.
l didn't know what
l took responsibility for.
l didn't finish the letter.
l fell asleep.
You fell asleep?
And you had rambled on for   pages.
Front and back!
By the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E
means ''you are.''
Y-O-U-R means ''your.''
l can't believe l thought of getting
Saturday nights at home...
...playing Scrabble with Monica.
Sorry!
All that sleep you'll miss
wishing you were with me!
Don't worry about me falling asleep.
l still have your letter!
Just so you know,
it's not that common.
lt doesn't happen to every guy.
And it is a big deal!
l knew it!
Gin.
We were playing gin?
lf we were a couple,
-Okay. All right.
All right.
l think you're great.
l think you're sweet and smart...
...and l love you.
But you'll always be the guy
who peed on me.
[ENGLlSH]
Wow. That ripped.
That ripped real nice!
How many times do I have to tell you?
You turn and slide.
Turn and slide.
You don't turn and slide.
You throw it out!
I get tetanus shots
I built it with my own hands!
How about we sell it?
All right.
But you'll have to tell them.
Can we stick you in another cabinet?
They seem all right with it!
The One with the Cat
Hey, why did the chicken
fall out of the tree?
Why?
Because you have
when Ben told it.
Hey, Monica.
It's Chip.
Who's Chip?
It was good running
into you today.
My number is -.
Why's he calling you?
Because I ran into him at the bank.
He is still so cute.
You're so lucky! He's like
the most popular guy in school!
I know!
Chip? Hi, it's Monica.
Oh, my God!
I hope I don't fall asleep.
Why? Did you write it?
Look at that!
Chip Matthews called.
I wonder what he wants.
Well, actually....
I bet he sensed that I was ready
to have sex with another guy.
Why don't you give him a call?
-Are you sure you want to hear this?
Hi, it's Rachel.
Rachel Greene.
You left me a message?
Yes, you did.
My roommate wrote it down.
Monica Geller?
Oh, that's right!
He called to ask out Monica.
That's got to be embarrassing.
Dumb drunken bitch
Thank you!
Here's a question.
Where'd you get the "finest oak
east of the Mississippi"?
First tell us where you got
the entertainment center?
Why? I love it.
-You want it?
-No.
Gepetto?
Five thousand dollars?
Are you insane?
The ad alone cost $.
I'm changing it
to $ or your best offer.
What kind of profit is that?
Shoo, kitty!
There's a kitty
in my guitar case.
Everyone's gonna want one.
Come on, you!
Crazy!
-Oh, my God!
-What?
Nothing.
What's wrong?
I just have this really strong feeling
She was a cat?
That makes the fact that she owns
beach-front property all the more impressive.
No. She was a human lady.
This is the spirit of my mom, Lilly.
The one that killed herself.
Have you been taking your grandmother's
First of all, there's the feeling.
And for another,
she went into my guitar case...
...which is lined with orange felt.
My mother's favorite fish
was orange roughy.
Cats like fish.
You had me with orange felt.
Hi, Mommy!
I haven't seen
-Let it go!
When were you going to tell me
that you're dating Chip?
Now?
Can I go out with him?
No. I can't believe you'd want to
after what he did to me.
That thing at the prom?
I couldn't find him for hours!
How can it still bother you?
Oh, yeah, you're right, Moni-cow.
Okay, I hear you.
Why do you have
to go out with Chip?
We went to different schools.
We went to the same school.
You went to one where you were popular.
You rode on Chip's motorcycle
and wore his letterman jacket.
I went to one where I wore a band
it was for the mascot.
Back then I thought that I'd never
get to go out with a Chip Matthews.
Now he's called me up
and asked me out.
The fat girl inside me really
-Really?
If possible, could you leave him
and have sex with another guy?
I'll try.
Any luck getting rid of
the entertainment center?
There were a couple calls,
screening process.
Not everyone is qualified
to own wood and nails.
Stop it!
She keeps trying to get away.
Just like when she was alive.
How long is your mom
the fact that there's...
...a new mom.
Now she's worried
that she'll be replaced.
That's not going to happen, is it?
I have to go make a call.
Why not use this phone?
I'm returning a call from
a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H.
I just spelled the wrong word.
Anyway, I don't want to do it
would never tell.
So am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom
remind anyone else of a cat?
Ross, don't start.
You actually believe
there's a woman inside that cat?
I believe it.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
No, you
You know what?
You won't suck me into this.
Sure I will.
Okay, okay.
Jurassic Park could happen.
And you know what? Actually,
I do think Kirk was smarter than Spock.
You were kidding about the
Kirk-Spock-thing, though, right?
That's pretty nice.
"Pretty nice"?
Pardon my roommate.
But would you trade for it?
We got a canoe.
I don't think we need a canoe.
You got to take it.
Just take the entertainment center.
Then when you get home,
throw the canoe away.
We're not throwing it away.
I built it.
Good for you!
You won't believe
also goes by the name "Julio."
Wait a minute. This is not the
same cat. This cat's only this big.
A little girl's looking for this cat.
Know what that means?
Yeah! $ reward split five ways!
Do we have to tell her?
-Yes, we do.
her mother is in a cat.
I have to go have
dinner with my son.
Can I trust that when you see Phoebe,
you will tell her?
Thank you.
I hate when Ross is right.
He is right, isn't he?
This might be one time
-Oh, no. He's right.
About your mom.
How's that going?
So great.
We took a nap together today.
Mom fell asleep
on my tummy and purred.
That's so sweet.
I'm gonna get some coffee.
What'd you say, Joe?
-I'm coming already!
Not yet, not yet, not yet!
-Hello, Chip.
-How you doing?
I'm great!
Got a great job.
I have wonderful friends.
Though I'm not seeing anyone now,
I haven't seen her since
So, Monica about ready?
-Wow, you look great.
-Thanks.
-Well, you guys have fun.
-Catch you later.
Bye, Chip.
-Are you sure you're okay about this?
tons of storage.
Some big enough to fit a grown man.
-What?
-Yeah, I got in there myself once.
My roommate bet me $ I couldn't.
Then he stuck a board
through the handles and locked me in.
It was funny till I felt
It's not deep enough.
Oh, yeah?
If I can't...
...I'll knock $ off the price.
All right, you have
yourself a deal.
See?
I told you.
Sometimes I come in here
your motorcycle in high school.
A motorcycle's a chopper.
And you're Chip.
Never mind.
I think it's cute.
A lipper from Chipper.
Are you still in touch with anyone?
There's Rachel...
...and that's it.
How about you?
I still hang with Simens and Zana.
I see Spindler, Levine, Kelly.
I run into Goldie...
...Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire...
...J.T., Beardsley.
Is that all?
After high school,
-Me and Simens gave him a wedgie.
Isn't he an architect?
They still wear underwear.
Oh, my God!
What?
Are you all right?
What happened?
Oh, man, he promised
he wouldn't take the chairs!
How were you locked in?
Where the hell is all of our stuff?
This guy came by
it won't fit a grown man.
So you got in voluntarily?
I was trying to make a sale!
If I ever run into him,
you know what I'll do?
Bend over?
And then Zana just let one rip!
Not that I don't enjoy
talking about high school...
...because I do.
Maybe we can talk
-I do?
The movie theater.
You used to come in all the time.
Still at the Multiplex?
Like I'd give up that job!
Free popcorn and candy
anytime I want?
I can get you posters.
Thanks, I'm set.
Oh, you know who came
Leslie Maskin. Got to third base.
Do you still live
with your parents?
Yeah, but I can stay out
as late as I want.
You know, with all of our stuff gone,
Your TV, the chairs.
Your microwave, the stereo.
Man, he took the five of spades!
No, here it is.
Oh, my God! What happened?
Joey was born, and then
 years later, I was robbed!
So how was your date?
Well, I always wanted to go out
with Chip in high school.
Tonight, I actually went out
to go out with Chip...
...I got to dump Chip.
-That's so great!
-I know.
What did the insurance company say?
They said, "You don't have insurance.
Stop calling us."
You didn't tell her?
Okay, fine.
Listen...
...this cat belongs to a little girl.
There are flyers all over the place.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
We can take her
-That's right.
Enough is enough.
I'm sorry you feel guilty about
spending time with your new mom.
But this isn't your old mom.
This is a cat.
Julio the cat.
Not Mom! Cat.
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
None.
Then you don't know how it feels
when one of them comes back.
I believe this is my mother.
Even if I'm wrong, who cares?
Just be a friend, okay?
the little girl?
Listen.
Mom, I hope you know
you still mean a lot to me.
You're welcome
to come back anytime.
If she'd come back as a couch,
I'll take you home.
-I'll go with you.
-Me too.
I got an extra futon.
Dude, you don't have to brag.
We got nothing here.
You know....
It's peaceful out here.
We are so in luck!
Treeger said we could have
rusty crap for free?
This and a bunch of bubble wrap.
And some of it is not even popped.
Could we be more white trash?
The One with the Cuffs
How desperate am l?
Good thing Chandler's not here.
He always wins at this game.
I just told my mom
-I need the money.
It'd be a great way to get rid of
that last smidgen of self-respect.
I think this is a good thing.
Mom wouldn't have hired you
if you weren't good.
You don't have to stick up for her.
I bumped into Joanna yesterday.
My boss, Joanna?
That must have been awkward.
Actually, she asked me
if I wanted a drink.
You didn't say yes to that,
you said she was a dud!
I judged her too quickly.
This time, we took it to the next level.
Last time I almost got fired.
You must end it. You must end it now.
It's not an everyday occurrence!
Usually I'm in there by myself.
Promise.
-Rachel, aren't you running late?
-Okay.
Promise you will end this now.
-I promise. I'll end it.
-Thank you.
I hope you know what I'm giving up.
She's not just the boss in your office.
You know what I mean?
Sorry.
Quiches are coming along.
What's this?
Blue nail polish?
I thought it was cute.
It's what your grandmother's hands
looked like when we found her.
Let me ask you a question.
Why did you hire me?
Richard raved about
lesbian wedding was nice.
I assume you didn't sleep
with anyone there.
At least that would be something.
Oh, my God!
Did you hear that?
She hired me because
She actually thinks I'm good.
And hey, it's cool
if you're a lesbian.
Good afternoon. Are you
the decision-maker of the house?
Do you currently own
People sell everything in there.
Actually, I'm not buying.
I'm selling.
Let me ask you one question.
Do your friends ever have
a conversation...
...and you just nod along,
it's totally unconstitutional.
I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
It was like the
Algonquin kids' table.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
You haven't said anything
for about two minutes.
Are you at all interested?
Come on in.
-That's weird.
give me grief about biting them.
I meant, it's weird that
you only have nine now.
Oh, my God!
Wait a minute.
I had them when I put
Oh, my God!
It's in the quiche!
-Oh, my God!
and you'll look great!
It's because they're going to eat
That's the problem.
Honey, don't bite your nails.
Please don't freak out.
There's a blue fingernail
in one of the quiche cups.
And there's no way to know which one.
And whoever finds it wins the prize!
I'm not freaking out.
-Why are you laughing?
I just bet that I'd need these.
Frozen lasagnas?
You bet that I'd screw up?
All that stuff about how I was good
No, that was all true.
This was just in case
you "pulled a Monica."
You promised Dr. Weinberg
you'd never use that phrase.
Come on.
laugh at yourself.
That's right.
My mom has no faith in me!
That's hilarious!
I don't get it.
No. I have faith.
No. You have lasagnas!
The ruined quiches are ready!
-I really don't think we should be doing this.
-Okay.
It just doesn't feel like
I'm sad.
Can you wait till tomorrow?
All right.
Unbelievable!
Thanks.
That was my boss.
I have to go.
What are you doing?
-I'm getting dressed.
people throw garbage.
Wait.
I want to show you something.
What is it?
Just a little gag gift
somebody gave me.
Put your hands together.
You're not the boss of me.
Yeah, you are.
Saucy!
I'll be back in two minutes.
You're going to leave me like this?
Knowing you're here waiting for me.
nothing I can do about it!
I brought you back a macaroon.
Great. I'll keep it in
my butt with your nose.
That's weird.
She locked the door.
You know why? She's got
a key to her office.
You want to see the list?
How are you?
Hello, Joanna
office.
I'm sorry.
I'll be a little longer.
-How little?
-A couple hours.
This isn't funny.
-Why not?
I'm in my boss' car.
-What?
-Tunnel!
What?
Rachel, could I see you
for a moment?
Okay, here's the situation.
The keys to the cuffs
scoot on over here and unlock me?
And on a totally separate subject,
that's a lovely pantsuit.
You promised you would
break up with her.
I did break up with her!
never entered your mind?
It did enter my mind.
But then something happened
that made it shoot right out.
You got yourself into those cuffs,
you get yourself out.
I can't get myself right out of them.
You must have me confused with
for hours, and I'm cold and....
All right! This is it!
Never see her again.
Never!
-Never come in here again.
-Fine!
Give me back my Walkman!
I never borrowed it.
Then I lost it.
Buy me one!
You got it! Here we go!
when handcuffs are taken off.
Hello, sweet pants!
Wait!
What will you tell Joanna?
About what?
She'll see you're gone and know
I let you out, and I'll get fired!
I'll tell a lie!
a key to her office.
I've got to lock you back up.
I don't think so.
This is much better.
Here's somebody interesting.
What do you know about Van Gogh?
-He cut off his ear.
-And?
I'm out.
He painted that.
That's pretty nice.
I thought he cut off his ear
because he sucked.
-What else you got in there?
-ln the woods.
Wait, that's the joke answer.
Actually, it's Vatican City.
Now, what do you know about
vulcanized rubber?
Spock's birth control.
You need these books.
This used to be your room?
You must have been in
really good shape as a kid.
I'm such an idiot!
I can't believe I thought
Just change what it means.
Prove your mother wrong.
You finish the job, and
we'll call that "pulling a Monica."
What?
If a kid gets straight A's, his
parents say, "You pulled a Monica."
A fireman saves a baby,
"That one's out of here."
Because some things don't change.
All right.
I'll go down there.
I won't serve the lasagna.
I'll serve what I make.
My breasts are really strong.
I have to get you locked back up.
You might as well let me go.
-I'll clean your bathroom for a month.
-Still won't be clean.
All I want is my freedom.
-Foot rubs for a month!
-Freedom!
-I'll put all your photos into albums!
Sophie, help me!
Sophie, sit!
Would you just calm down?!
I'm going to say this
for the last time.
Would you please just
There's a lot I didn't know
about vomit.
In a minute.
So what do you say?
You get the whole set
just  bucks a book.
$?
You think I have $?
I'm home during the day...
...and I got patio furniture
in my living room.
There's a few things
you don't get from book learning.
Well, what can you swing?
How about zero down and zero a month
Thanks for your time.
And a fifty.
These must be Chandler's pants.
For $ you can get one book.
What will it be?
A? B? C?
I'll stick with the V.
I want to see how
this bad boy turns out.
I will buy and wrap
every morning!
-With extra pulp?
-Yeah.
I've got it!
You don't have it.
I have so got it!
There will be rumors about this.
No way to stop it.
Sophie, Monica and Phoebe know.
-How do they know?
this generation's Milton Berle.
-And Milton Berle has
-Not compared to you.
They're not even
touching the lasagna.
They love your casserole!
It's hard to believe a while
and you liked it...
...that would make this a success.
Which would make you....
A bitch?
I meant "wrong,"
but we can use your word.
Yes, well, I was wrong.
And I have to say...
...you really impressed me today.
You might even say that she
in the freezer.
That really means a lot.
Mom, don't bite your nails!
Hello, Chandler.
I love you.
What's going on?
No, he doesn't!
Two hours, that lasted.
So did you break up with Joanna?
I think so.
It's good you got out,
before she blew up like Vesuvius.
The volcano?
Speaking of volcanoes, man, are they
a violent igneous rock formation!
What?
Lava spewing, hot ash.
Of course, some are dormant.
Why are you talking about volcanoes
Vivisection?
The vas deferens?
The Vietnam War?
Did anyone see that documentary
on the Korean War?
Korea's a beautiful country.
With such a sad history.
Could there be more Kims?
-Who's out there?
-Me! Good morning!
Could you come in here, please?
Sure! They didn't have
Oh, my word!
I've had a slight office mishap.
Could you get the key for me?
-lf you could.
-Oh, I'm sorry!
You can tell your friend Chandler
we're definitely broken up this time!
Hey, new wallet?
It was time.
The old condom ring in the leather
back in the fridge.
I know,
but the garbage was full.
Have you ever taken out the trash?
Since you've lived here?
Well, I thought you liked doing it.
-Third door on the left.
-Right!
Hey, Mr. Treeger.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
It's a little old but....
You're clogging up the chute
I don't come in here a lot.
Of course not.
You're a little princess.
Daddy, buy me a pizza.
Daddy, buy me a candy factory.
Daddy, make the cast of Cats
sing "Happy Birthday" to me.
You think you can come here...
...make a mess and a big man
that were only partly true.
I'll teach him a lesson.
Joey, don't.
Let's forget about it.
That's easy for you to say.
You weren't almost just killed!
All right, that's it.
but I've missed...
...the last  times.
So why don't you quit?
You don't think I've tried?
You think I like having $ a month
taken from my account?
They make you go
all the way down there.
They use all these phrases
-Oh, Maria!
You can't say no to her.
She's like this lycra,
spandex-covered, gym treat.
Do you need me to go with you
and hold your hand?
You're strong enough to face her?
Oh, no. You'll have to come.
Tribbiani.
You made my friend Rachel cry.
So you'll go and apologize to her...
...unless you want me
to call the landlord.
And tell him what?
Maybe you haven't heard of
"not making girls cry."
Maybe you haven't heard of the
but I don't need this grief.
I'm telling the landlord...
...Monica's illegally
subletting her grandmother's place.
Your friends are out of here, pal.
Why don't you tell me
something I don't know?
Somebody tell me
this incredibly gorgeous guy.
Every time I see him,
I want to...
...do things to him
I can't charge for.
So do them for free.
No, it is forbidden.
Mrs. Potter fires people
as a masseuse.
-They make you take an oath?
-No, I made myself take one.
No fooling around with clients...
...and always be prepared.
That one's from the Boy Scouts,
but it just makes good sense.
Why not give him to someone else?
No, I can handle it.
a new ankle bracelet?
You got a pedicure.
Your feet are all dressed up.
That's the only part he can see
when he's on the table!
You're going to do
some feet flirting!
I don't know what
Leave me alone!
My hero! What happened?
I told him no one treats
my friends like that.
And he better apologize.
See you!
Wait a minute.
What did he say?
He wouldn't apologize because
See you later!
-You got us evicted?
-I told you not to go down there.
He made Rachel cry!
Rachel always cries!
That's not true!
You go down there,
and you suck up to him.
You suck like
till you get settled.
-Go!
-All right, all right.
I'll have to check first,
but he'll be cool.
Remember what we talked about.
and rock-hard pecs?
No, I want a flabby gut
and saggy man-breasts.
That's good.
I want to quit the gym.
You want to quit?
I want to quit the gym.
You do realize you won't have
access to our new Swedish spa?
I want to quit the gym.
Dave in the membership office
Are you a member?
Me?
Sorry. Members only.
I want to quit the gym!
It's okay, man.
Be strong.
Are you a member of any gym?
No, and I'm not going to be.
So save your little speech.
Okay, no problem.
Could you come here?
Hi, I'm Maria.
You have really pretty feet.
These old things?
Would you spend time on my
in the sciatic area can get...
...real nice and tight.
So tell me, Rick,
how did you injure the area?
A -hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
-Did you just bite me?
-No!
Please don't kick the girls out.
you guys out instead?
You can't. Where would
the chick and the duck live?
You have pets?
Those are nicknames.
I'm the "chick,"
and Chandler's the "duck."
I would've thought
Let the girls stay.
I'll do whatever you want.
Really? You'd do anything?
Yeah, absolutely.
I got something.
What is it?
Can you be my dancing partner?
That's not prison lingo, is it?
I want to quit the gym.
Can you honestly tell me that you're
% satisfied with your body.
Yes, yes. Most of the time.
I mean, sure, I have my bad days, but
then I remember what a cute smile I have.
We were voted "Best-equipped Gym
-Yes, I hate it here.
Everything that you have
in here is very heavy.
Really? Okay?
You want to make your
friend work out alone?
-What friend?
"The Super Ball."
He wants to impress Marge,
this lady super he likes.
Why not practice with a girl?
He's too shy.
He's not good enough
to dance with girls yet.
Yeah, right.
He almost danced me right down
You're fine.
So did you quit?
I almost did.
Couldn't leave Ross there
without a spotter.
Wait, now, so you joined the gym?
And that's funny, why?
I was just, you know,
picturing you working out, and....
Well, that's it.
We're doomed.
They'll take $ a month from our
and cut them off at the source.
You're a genius.
Oh, man! But then,
we won't be bank buddies.
Now there's two reasons.
You guys, remember that cute client
I told you about?
I bit him.
-Where?
but the moment I touch him...
...I want to throw out my old oath
and take a new, dirty one.
Next time, try to distract yourself.
Like when I'm doing
something exciting...
...and I don't want to get too...
...excited.
I try and think of other things.
-Oh, no, thank you.
All right, I'm here.
Let's get this over with.
Okay, well...
...just follow my lead.
Don't we need to do some kind
of preparation first?
Like get really drunk?
Come on. Hey, just put
But if I'm Marge...
...my breasts are coming out my back.
Forget it!
I'm not being any good at this.
My mom was right.
I'm just a big potato
with arms and legs and a head.
Come on, man.
It's no use.
Marge will never go for me.
Come on, Treeger.
Don't say that.
You just need more practice.
Come on.
Let's try it again.
Plus, it was probably
dancing with a
So how goes the dancing?
Gay yet?
You guys owe me bigtime.
What was that?
You just did a little dancy thing.
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.
-You did a little hop.
It was a pas de bourree.
You know the words!
You are so into this!
Maybe I'm enjoying it a little.
I'm getting pretty good at it.
This is so sweet.
Joey, our little twinkletoes.
This isn't some kind of girly dance.
It's like a sport, it's manly.
-Show me some "manly" moves.
Is there a problem?
No, we'd just like to close them.
Ms. Lambert handles all our closures.
Would you come over here, please?
Hi, I'm Karen.
I want to quit the bank!
Okay. Baseball.
Rick playing baseball.
He slides into second.
Maybe even his pants
come down a little.
Okay, sandwiches.
That's working!
Chandler's knees.
Chandler's ankles.
Chandler's ankle hair.
Oh, no!
Okay, you're all set.
Wow! That was amazing!
Was that really just an hour?
In really long-hour world.
What?
I have an enormous crush on you.
But since you're a client,
I can't ask you out...
...even though you give me
the feelings.
I had no idea.
I can always find another masseuse.
Really?
Yeah, really.
What?
Suddenly I'm very aware I'm naked.
Quiet down.
Mr. Simon's been waiting
This is not that kind of place.
I know, but this isn't
how it looks at all...
...because Rick is my husband.
Oh, really?
You'd better tell his other wife.
She called three times
asking where he is.
Yes, I will tell her.
So you didn't leave the bank?
And somehow we ended up
We were making out.
Then my boss walked in
and fired me for being a whore.
-You got fired?
-Oh, my gosh!
It's so weird. I have never
not knowing what to do next.
I started asking people on the street
if they wanted massages.
Then these policemen thought
I was a whore too.
It's really been a bad day,
Is Chick here?
Yeah, Bunny Rabbit.
Ready for our last practice?
We're not getting that spin right
because my place is too small.
-Want to use our place?
-No, I had another idea.
We did it!
That was incredible!
That was amazing!
Thanks a lot, Tribbiani.
Oh, my God!
Look at the time.
I got to catch the bus to the ball.
Good luck.
Unless you want to practice
the fox trot. Or the tango?
Thanks, but no.
You see, I think I'm ready
-Right.
You want to come?
Marge has a friend.
Really?
You'd dance good with her.
She's the same size as me.
No, I'm good.
It looks like you've got
Reason for leaving last job?
They thought I was a whore.
Okay. We'll give you a call
if anything comes up.
Great. Thank you very much.
Joe, I don't think a four-letter word
for "ship" can be "ship."
I thought it was a freebie.
Hello!
What's this?
Oh, right!
Just a phone number...
...a really hot girl gave me.
It's no big deal. I mean,
it is her home phone number, but....
Almost lost this baby!
The lovely Amanda gives me her
number, and I go and drop it.
Thank you.
The One with
-May th. Why?
I'm making a list of birthdays.
-Mine's December
-Yeah, whatever.
She's pretty!
Pretty, pretty girl. The pretty
She's pretty.
Go ask her out.
-What's the worst that could happen?
and you didn't even kiss her.
I tell people secrets.
It makes them like me.
All I'm gonna say is, finally, it's
nice to be in a mature relationship.
You know, the world would
be such a better place...
...if that actually was
You shouldn't play. Go home.
But I'm unemployed.
My music is all I really have now.
Well, music and making my own shoes.
Pretty, huh?
All right, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna go get shot down.
Any advice?
Just be yourself...
...but not too much.
Wish me luck.
Good luck!
Wish it!
I was just sitting over there and....
My name's Chandler.
Did I say that?
No, you didn't.
-With a K.
Wow, you are really good at this!
I'm out on a limb here!
I'm sorry.
You're right.
But I should tell you,
I'm waiting for a date.
And there he is now!
I see you guys already met.
I was trying to demonstrate...
...how I could get my
that I have a cold.
So if I sneeze during a song,
it's not on purpose.
Except the last verse of
"Pepper People."
Smelly cat, smelly cat
What are they feeding you?
This chick sounds good.
Smelly cat
Gunther, be a good little boy
to have to fight over the remote.
Sorry, there's this Ernie Kovacs
thing I wanted to watch.
That's why I got up too.
You're kidding?
I love him!
My dad made me stay up
you watch the Mr. Universe contest?
-No.
-Well, me neither.
I'm sorry about this afternoon. If I had
known that you two, I never would have....
Oh, please.
Joey tells me you two met
Joey picked three scenes for us to do.
All of them had us making out.
That's a good thing because he used to
make me rehearse with him.
-ls it on?
-No, but this Wonder Broom is amazing!
Oh, my God!
It's on!
Here we go, little fella.
What about the duck?
The duck can swim.
My sticky shoes
My sticky, sticky shoes
Why you stick on me?
Baby
Thanks for the lights, honey.
Way to go!
Your cold makes you sound great.
It's fun.
We're going to buy hamsters.
I love them.
No, it's not like that.
I work for a medical researcher.
-Well, have fun.
-Okay.
It's nice that
-Yeah, it's great.
You know what?
I like Kathy.
Me too!
She's so cool and pretty.
She is.
She's smart and funny.
We were up all last night talking.
Chandler loves Kathy.
-Come on, just lay off him.
-Thank you.
He's a little sensitive right now
because he's so in love!
All right.
Kathy, I love you!
I need to write some depressing stuff
ever really happened to me.
How about your mom dying?
Or having to live on the streets
when you were ?
I could write about the time
my hair did that whoo-hoo thing.
I'm going over to Amanda's tonight.
Rachel's not here.
How's it going with her?
Great, actually. I'm thinking
and then when they're asleep...
...I'm thinking Amanda and I break
open a bottle of wine...
...do a little playing ourselves.
Hi, guys! This is Josh.
Josh, these are my friends.
And that's Ross.
Dudes.
You played in college?
I still do.
Next year, I hope to make varsity.
Didn't you play soccer
their game schedules on your Commodore .
It's getting late. I gotta get
to the game, so I'm gonna...head.
I'll miss you.
Dope!
Wow! Cute one.
-Very cute.
-I know. Isn't he great?
So nice to finally be in a
in a museum.
Maybe he'll get to go soon.
Like on a class trip or something.
You know what else is
great about him?
What is the word for an adult...
...who doesn't have dinosaur
toys in their bedroom?
What was that?
Monica knows.
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up
without actually having to give it.
I cried the night you made that up.
It was the first time I realized
I was cooler than my big brother.
I'm going to go get ready...
...for my date tonight...
...so I'll just "head."
I should go too.
I'm playing in one hour.
You guys should come hear me.
Hear me.
My sticky shoes
I lost my sexy phlegm!
Hi, Ben.
-You look great!
could come over tonight.
Oh, no. It's my pleasure.
My cell phone number
is here on the counter.
Please, help yourself to
anything in the fridge.
I appreciate this so much. I have
wait and drink your wine...
...after the kids are asleep.
I blocked the adult channels for the other
babysitters, but the code is four, three
I'm fine.
Thanks for this. I hope I can do
the same for you sometime.
Who wants to make
Kathy! Hi!
Kathy!
Kathy!
Kathy!
Fetch!
Fetch it!
Kathy!
worse than it was.
Her date tipped me $!
What are you doing?
I want to be sexy again,
so I'm trying to catch a cold.
Should be easy.
They're pretty common.
You'll catch pneumonia!
Okay, you were right.
-Are you serious?
How is that possible?
You barely know her.
I don't know. I just
I can't get her out of my head.
I'm a very bad person.
I'm a very, very bad person.
I'm a horrible person.
"No, you're not.
when you do that!
We were just talking about you.
Really?
The time you got drunk
and fell asleep...
...with your head in the toilet.
Right in there!
-What movie did you get?
-I got what I always get.
Die Hard.
That's what I like about Joey.
is my favorite movie too."
But Joey goes, "No way.
Let's get Die Hard.
I'm not watching that English crap."
Yeah, he's dreamy.
I gotta go.
I gotta go meet some friends.
He has other friends?
Ninety-nine...
...a hundred.
one more time.
You want to get some dinner
with me and Kathy tonight?
You know what?
I already ate.
It's :.
I had a big meal on Monday.
So that'll get me
-Yeah.
You don't like Kathy.
You got me.
You've been avoiding her
ever since we started going out.
I made an effort to like Janice.
Now I think it's your turn to make an effort
to like Kathy by going out with us. Right?
-Yeah, right.
-Right.
Sorry, Grandma.
Ross isn't here.
Stop it!
I'll see you at the party?
Beer's fear, man!
Twenty-four, seven!
I am so gonna marry that guy.
What?
-I think he's stealing from me.
-Why?
Because he's stealing from me!
Hi, it's me...
...and soup.
I just saw Josh. He looked so
so it's just noodle soup.
There's no chicken in the broth,
so it's really just noodle water.
-Thank you so much.
-Sure.
What are you doing?
I need your germs.
You can see that girl's underwear.
Is she great, or what?
What do you think?
She's not really my type.
Not your type?
She's gorgeous.
You know what it is?
The fishnet stockings.
Whenever I see a girl in fishnet
why you're single.
I have a friend you'd like. She's really
pretty. And then we could double date.
No, thanks.
I've got some ugly friends, and
they're all available too.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
I'll be right back.
-What was that?
and you just walked away.
What do you want from me?
I want you to like her.
If that's too damn difficult for you,
then the least you could do is pretend.
-I am pretending.
-Then do it better.
What do you say I go over there and
I've been thinking of her.
I haven't stopped thinking
about her since we met.
I'm so over the top,
want-to-slit-my-own-throat...
...in love with her
luck that you met her first!
That's pretty good.
But you might want
to tone it down a little.
I still have a fever? Are you
sure that thing's working right?
Well, we could take
I love about her.
She's old enough to drive.
You're not going
to Mom and Dad's tonight?
No, sorry.
Where's Amanda?
Could you get me
some cough drops?
I'm thinking you could bring her...
...and you guys could go up to your
going out with me...
...to get into R-rated movies.
Why don't you just marry her?
Wait, you can't! I forgot.
She's not a lesbian.
-Amanda and I have a
-You have nothing!
You're not even going out!
Miss My-keg-sucking-boyfriend...
...-is-stealing-from-me?
So he stole a couple bucks
from me. Big deal!
At least he got me
something with it.
That's mine!
Would you both please
-Sorry.
Here.
Thank you.
At least I made $ in
my relationship.
You know...?
Parading goats are parading
Parading down the street
Parading goats are parading
Leaving little treats
Does it even work
without my sexy voice?
I like it.
-Gunther, kiss me.
Do something!
We aren't exactly sleeping in here,
but do you mind?
Can I sleep on your couch?
And I'm still waiting
For my papier-mache man
Thank you, my babies.
Rachel?
Did you hear what happened
between me and Phoebe?
We kissed. I didn't initiate it,
-You're welcome for a tasty dinner.
What are you guys looking at?
Ross and the most beautiful girl
in the world.
Yeah, come to Papa!
I know!
Probably the only time
I'll say this...
...but did you see the ass on her?
What did you...?
How did you get a girl like that?
So what is she, like a spokesmodel?
An aerobics instructor?
Actually, she's a paleontology
doctoral candidate...
...specializing in the Cenozoic Era.
But that's, like, the easiest era.
I've seen her at work,
And we're going out again tomorrow.
Maybe her friends are betting to see
who gets the biggest geek.
Fine by me.
Hope she wins.
Hey, we should have
the most beautiful woman.
That's a good idea, Joe.
We could call it life.
The One with the Dirty Girl
You have any wrapping paper?
Is it for my birthday present?
It was your birthday months ago.
You said you ordered something special
and it just hadn't come yet.
I have a call in about that.
It's for Kathy. It's an early copy
makes the rabbit real....
Don't touch it because
your fingers have destructive oils.
Then you'd better keep it away
from Ross' hair.
This is pretty rare.
I just went to some bookstores...
...talked to some dealers, called
some of the author's grandchildren.
Honey, that's so sweet.
What a great way to say, "l secretly
love you, roommate's girlfriend."
It doesn't say that.
Does it?
How will it look when you get her
Joey, gives her an orange?
I'll make sure Joey gets her
something really great.
It's got to be better than that book.
Like a crossbow!
Once again, I am sorry.
Thank you. Bye.
I had to turn down a job
catering a funeral for  people.
Oh, my God!
the money or equipment...
...to handle something that big
on such short notice.
Wow, what is with all the negativity?
You sound like "Moni-can't,"
not "Moni-can"!
Moni-ca.
You've been playing around
-I don't know.
There you go!
That's the spirit!
If you need money, I will lend
you money. Just get moving!
Really? I'd need $
You haven't worked in months!
-Neither have you.
-Yes, but I'm doing this.
That would be great! Thank you.
-Can I borrow your apartment keys?
-Why?
You can pee here.
Yes, I can, of course.
It's okay.
for her birthday?
We've been dating a couple weeks.
I got to get her something?
You have to get her
something really nice.
-I know!
-No.
Last week I got all
but three answers...
...and I want to finish one
without any help.
Fine.
But you can't help me develop
It was the best funeral ever!
Everyone loved the food.
I even got another funeral
for tomorrow.
The dead guy from today's best friend.
It's like I am the official caterer
for that accident.
Mon, I'm so happy for you!
Thanks. Check out
I'm an omelet station!
Omelet? Made to order?
I'll have one, please.
Plus my money.
I didn't realize
you needed it right away.
You told me to go and be a caterer.
so I'll pay you back then.
Okay. Sorry I acted like a bank.
Aborigine.
Oh, no, I tried that already.
Would you like to come in?
Did Homo erectus hunt
with wooden tools?
According to recent findings.
Here, Mitzi! Here, Mitzi!
Mitzi is...?
My hamster.
I hope she's okay.
Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
Well, I do.
Let's go back to my place,
light a couple candles...
...break open a box
of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties....
-I'd rather not.
has a weird smell.
-ls everything in the car?
-Did you settle the bill?
I hate this part.
Look what we almost left!
That's not mine.
Look what we almost took!
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart?
Well, we're all cleaned up.
Good. Thank you.
And, well, there's
this small matter of the....
-Dear?
-No, but I made a widow cry.
See you in hell.
You know what we should all do?
Go see a musical.
Sure.
You know which one?
The  Tony Award winner.
I mean, that one's gotta be good.
Do you know the name of that one?
I don't know. Grease?
Rent?
Yes! Rent!
So when do you want to go?
What? I'm sorry.
I can't, I'm busy.
Man, it is so hard
to shop for girls.
Yes, it is...
...at Office Max!
What did you get her?
A pen.
It's two gifts in one.
-Why not?
She's not !
And it's not the seventh night
of Chanukah.
What he means by that is,
while this is a very nice gift...
...maybe it's not something
"It's time for my date with Joey!"
All right. What did you get
for Angela Del Veccio's birthday?
She didn't have one.
For three years?
Look, it's too late,
and I got an audition.
I can't shop anymore.
I will go out
could you get her a card?
Would you like me to write her
a little poem as well?
Or just get a card
that has a poem already in it.
Oh, so it's a card,
-She couldn't stop crying.
With those thick glasses,
her tears look giant.
I know, it's tough.
You know what the first thing I did
after my mom's funeral was?
-What?
who always try to get out of paying.
It's either "That massage
wasn't long enough"...
...or "l don't know
any of those songs"...
...or "These sombreros aren't
till you showed her the bill.
She sounded pretty upset to me.
She seems fine now.
So you just left?
Her place was really that bad?
You throw your jacket on a chair
at the end of the day.
Like that, only instead of a chair,
it's a pile of garbage.
And instead of the end of the day,
it's the end of time...
...and garbage is all
that has survived.
-Here.
I had to get out of there.
Next time, you take her
to your place.
I tried that.
She says it has a weird smell.
-What kind of smell?
-Yeah.
-You want to see her again?
-Yeah.
So you're going to have
to do it in the mess!
Yeah, okay. You're right.
I mean, who cares about
-All right!
Now you go get that beautiful pig!
I just spent the entire
afternoon looking for a present...
...for Kathy that would be
better than the rabbit.
Any luck?
Yeah, I found this great place
with all this stuff?
Just return the book,
let Joey give her the clock pen...
...and you get her
something worse than that...
...Iike a regular pen.
She's really going
I want her to have it...
...even if I don't get to be
the one who gives it to her.
Honey, that's so sweet.
You don't think it's just pathetic?
Oh, "pathetic"!
I've been looking all over for you.
-Where?
-Our place. The hall.
I got something for her.
It's a book.
A book?
Is it a book that's also a safe?
It's a book that's just a book.
It's the Velveteen Rabbit.
if she likes it, okay?
You got it. Thanks for doing this.
I owe you one.
There wasn't any change
from that twenty, was there?
No, it came out to an even twenty.
Wow. That's almost
-Maybe I can try at intermission?
You know what?
Let's just go.
We're not leaving till we get paid!
I don't know
who she thinks she is.
I talked to the florist.
can get the dead guy damned for all eternity.
Well, I'm not going back out there.
Fine. Enough is enough!
Hey, widow?
Widow?
Excuse me? Excuse me!
Thanks. Clearly this is
a very, very hard time for you.
But we provided a service,
and we deserve to be paid...
...because you ate that service.
We are not leaving here until
and we have no place else to go.
All right. I'll get my bag.
Good.
I'm going to leave some cards here.
Please think of us
for your next event.
So you want to come inside?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I'll be right back.
Make yourself comfortable.
Guess who?
Department of Sanitation?
It's me.
What?
Oh, Cheryl!
-It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
I must have freaked out.
Thank God it's not Mitzi!
It's just a rat.
I did it!
I finished it!
I did it all by myself!
And there's nobody to hug.
Move!
Hey, you guys!
I finished it all by myself!
Hug me.
-Congratulations.
so Phoebe yelled at her till she did.
I'm a hard-ass.
And I'm a wuss.
We should be partners.
Hard-ass and wuss.
We could fight crime.
Wait a minute, Phoebe.
We should be partners.
We should be catering partners.
You're not working now,
of the money.
It'll be like
I have a wife in the s!
How did she like the gift?
She loved it.
She's showing the girls right now.
Yeah? That's great.
I got to tell you...
...I feel bad taking credit
a lot of credit for this!
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.
You know, Chandler got you
a gift too.
No, he didn't.
Yeah, he did. Look,
turn it over and it's also a clock.
No, this is great!
-Thank you, Chandler.
-Oh, yeah.
Want to go to bed?
I'll be in, in a minute.
Don't forget your coupon.
Good night.
Thank you for the gift.
I just knew that
sometimes when you're writing...
...you don't always
Thank you for the book.
The book?
The Velveteen Rabbit?
I have a feeling you had
something to do with it.
What do you mean?
"This is because I know you like
rabbits, and I know you like cheese."
Thanks. I love it.
I know how hard
that sound was, "Oh, well."
You must really like Joey
to go to all that trouble.
Oh, yeah. He's my
He's my best friend.
-Well....
-Good night.
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
You don't know me.
that didn't work out.
Anyway, he told me
about your apartment.
Well, I couldn't sleep
thinking about it.
So would it be okay
you're in for a surprise.
It keeps getting worse.
It bad enough that I'm in love
with my roommate's girlfriend.
Every time we're in the same room,
there's weird energy between us.
Call me crazy, but
was covered in boils.
But there are no boils.
She's smooth.
Smooth!
-Could everyone see up his robe?
-Oh, my God!
The One Where
-I'll call you.
Great!
Hey, hey. Who was that?
Casey. We're going out tonight.
Going out? Wow!
It didn't work out
with Kathy? Bummer.
No, things are fine.
I'm having a late meal with her
after an early one with Casey.
-What?
I just ate a whole pizza myself.
You're going out with Kathy!
Yeah. Why are you upset?
Well, I'm upset...
...for you.
Sex with an endless line of beautiful
women must be unfulfilling.
What's the big deal?
It's not like we're exclusive.
Look, Joey.
Kathy's clearly not fulfilling
the back of her head.
But I got this sense
that she's smart and funny...
...and gets you.
You got all that
from the back of her head?
I think it's time
Pick a lane.
Who's Elaine?
Little Tony Tarzan
Swinging on a nose hair
Swinging with the greatest of ease
I don't know the next verse.
Greatest of ease
Then go right into it.
I like that.
How do you know about...?
You know, I used to play.
That's right.
The keyboards?
A little in high school.
I really found my sound.
Orange juice just came out
of my nose, but it was worth it.
Oh, my God!
I completely forgot about
your sound.
He'd lock himself in
the sound.
I want to hear the sound.
No, I mean,
I haven't played in so long.
Well, it's really personal stuff.
Play that funky music, white boy.
-Yeah, come on.
-No, you guys.
My keyboards are all the way
I wanna try that new ltalian restaurant.
Supposed to be really good. Saw a
lot of Chinese people eating in there.
What are you talking about?
You said some restaurant must be good
because Chinese people were eating there.
That's because it was
Who wants to come?
Oh, I can't. I got two dinner dates
tonight, so I gotta get ready.
All right, girls' night out.
Sorry, but we have to prep that
catering thing for tomorrow.
Oh, that's right.
I wish I could eat
It's a really good thing to do.
I just think I'd feel really self-conscious.
Like I was on display or something.
I was on display once.
Nothing like eating alone.
I just had a great time with myself.
Well, this could be a good story.
At dinner.
have fun. I'm fun. I'm a fun girl.
Are you a naughty girl?
No, just fun. Fun. Good. Fun.
-See, I told you you'd have fun.
-I know.
Although I must say that I totally
judge any woman I see eating alone.
-Why?
She's eating alone.
Okay, guys.
All right! Bring it on, you!
Here we go.
You know, I've never played
my stuff for anyone before.
So it's important that
you understand...
...it's about communicating...
...very private emotions.
You know....
You should think of my work...
...as wordless sound poems.
-That's what
play in public.
Wow, thanks, you guys.
That's
I want to play you another piece.
I left my helicopter sounds on
another disk. I'll be right back, okay?
This is so nice.
soundproofing the basement.
I can't believe I ever let him
touch me with those fingers.
What are you guys talking about?
I loved it!
It was so moving.
It's so different
are just as firm and juicy.
Come in.
Oh, God! Is that Baywatch?
Yes, but I just watch it
for the articles.
-So is Joey around?
-No, he's not back yet.
Come in, have a seat.
had a little car trouble.
-What happened?
-We broke down.
I have to get transmission fluid.
Tell Kathy that I'm sorry
and I'll be there soon.
-Why can't you tell her?
and he says he's sorry.
I guess it's just you and me, then.
-Okay.
-Yeah, I think it is.
So, what'd you do today?
I had an appointment
to cut my hair.
-Looks great!
-Really? Do you do that?
Yeah, I learned at my aunt's
dog-grooming shop. What do you say?
Dog grooming?
Don't make my tail too poofy.
You have really great hair.
Oh, thanks. I grow it myself.
You know who also
has great hair is Joey.
Yes, Joey has great hair.
I'm basically done here.
The phone's making sounds!
Hey, dude, it's me.
Hey, it's Joey!
It looks like we'll be stuck here.
I got the fluid.
The transmission wasn't there.
-What?
-It fell out.
I just figured we hit a dog.
Could you put Kathy on?
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, no, stop apologizing.
It's okay.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I should probably go.
I forgot my purse.
I really did.
I forgot my purse.
-This is bad! It's bad!
-Here's what we do.
-We forget it happened.
-What?
We swallow our feelings, even if
we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
Can you really do that?
I have to. He's my best friend.
And you're seeing him.
Chandler, I like Joey a lot.
-But with you
I'm starting to yearn.
I'm sorry.
If you want to pretend that
nothing happened, I can try.
I think we have to.
Are you still out there?
Electrifying
Infinite time
There's a Starbucks
about three blocks down.
He's so inspired.
-Why not?
I can't follow Ross.
It'd be like those
poor bicycle-riding chimps...
...who had to
follow the Beatles. No.
Ross sucks.
The place has emptied because of him.
Oh, my God, he's not even
appreciated in my own time!
You suck too.
You're awful.
You guys!
You suck too!
Man! I can't believe
I locked myself out again!
Hang on, buddy.
Oh, my God! What happened?
-Did you do all this? Why?
-I sure did.
It made me feel good to do
as if from nowhere!
That's the dream!
How did you afford all this?
I'm . I mean, who needs
a savings account?
You're the best friend
anyone has ever had.
I don't know.
No, you are.
You do this, you give me advice....
What you said about
She's cool.
-Or Casey.
-No, Kathy.
-Could be Casey.
-No, Kathy.
Consider Casey.
I think somebody's
What do you think?
That all the pieces of my life
are falling right into place.
You were really great.
You were really, really great.
Thanks.
Monica tells me you don't want
and upbeat about it...
...but I just feel so dwarfed
by your musical gift.
See, but....
Pheebs, that is the exact
opposite intent of my music.
You know, my music
depriving the world of your music?
Yeah, okay.
-I'd love to, but I have plans on Sunday.
-Well, maybe some other time.
-Sure. Just give me a call, I'm in the book.
-Okay. Thanks a lot. See you.
What are you doing?
-Honey, I eavesdrop because I care.
-Well, I have plans on Sunday.
-With who?
-Me.
-Oh, God.
You are the one who told me how
when I have plans with myself.
Wouldn't be fair to me.
So basically you're saying you
don't want to cheat on yourself.
Well, if you wanna make
me sound crazy.
Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
I kissed Kathy.
Are you serious?
-Does Joey know?
he will understand this?
You obviously haven't
screwed over your friends.
Which we all appreciate.
If you'd told him how you felt
before you kissed her...
...knowing Joey,
That's not true, is it?
Yeah, he loves you.
Then why didn't you
tell me to do that?
I said something to Phoebe.
And I thought it was
a really good idea.
-Yeah, I remember.
-Why do I have to tell him?
-Because you do.
-Yeah, I know.
Would it be okay
if I wrote a song about this?
I don't know if this is
enjoy this. I do.
I just wanna see
what else is out there.
Hey, Guy. What are you doing here?
I work across the street.
-lt turns out I'm gonna be free Sunday.
-I wish you had called me.
I just told them I'd work this weekend.
Okay, well, maybe next weekend.
-Definitely. I'll see you.
because you're a freak who eats alone.
Sambuca margarita?
It that a real thing?
Well, we only had sambuca,
so it is now.
Listen, Joe. I need to I need
to talk to you about something.
What's up?
It's about Kathy.
I like her.
I like her a lot, actually.
-You do?
-When?
Just now, after acting class.
I thought she was doing some scene,
so I let people watch.
Man, I am so sorry.
Are you okay?
I've been better, but I'm all right.
Because you came to me first.
I thought that would be
the best thing to do.
You might have your work
cut out for you.
When I talked to her, I got
I wanted to talk to you about.
I think I know who the other guy is.
Who?
It's me.
I'm the other guy.
What?
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I got to talking...
...and one thing led
to another, and....
And what?
-What? That's even worse!
-How is that worse?
-It's the same!
There's nothing I could do.
I think I'm in love with her!
Who cares?
You went behind my back?
I was totally over the line.
You're so far past the line,
that you can't even see the line!
The line is a dot to you!
Yes, right! And I feel horrible.
You have to believe me.
Oh, my God. Is that
bread maker I won't eat. Know why?
-Probably because
-It's all tainted with your betrayal!
This apartment is empty to me!
I'm not happy about you either.
And just so you know...
...I made that bread for you.
Oh, my God! He's lost it.
are hanging themselves.
Thank you. Thanks.
I lost it.
I won't play anymore.
Would you?
Can you finish my set?
After that? Yeah.
No, I mean, if I can help.
Yeah, like I could lose it.
What?
I played bad on purpose, guys.
Okay, you were trying to
play bad this whole time.
No. Just that last song.
﻿
<iover the phone</i--
<i>I shouldn't have kissed</i>
<i>your girlfriend</i>--
Stop calling!
<i>This is . WXRK, K-Rock...</i>
<i>...calling with our $  OOO</i>
All right!
-Joey, it's Ross.
-Sorry.
-lt's all right.
What's up?
Not much. l got Chandler
here and he's really, really sorry--
The One with Chandler in a Box
Oh, turkey!
Giving thanks!
Look, everyone.
l spent eight hours calling him...
...trying to get him
to talk to me.
Eight hours.
You could probably use
a plug-in telephone headset.
Should we all expect Christmas gifts
a new business and have no money...
...this year we could do Secret Santa
and each only buy one gift.
And there's the added mystery
of who gets who.
Who gets whom.
l don't know why l do that.
But it is correct.
Hey, what's this?
-We're picking names for Secret Santa.
Okay.
l invented Secret Santa, you know.
What are you laughing at? You're the
one who said <i>Die Hard</i> was your idea.
lt was.
Don't make me show you the napkin.
l'm going to take a nap.
Turkey makes me sleepy.
We haven't eaten yet.
l know, but all that work
Secret Santa? l'll trade for her.
l picked her.
Thank God, you want her!
Why do you want to get
rid of her so badly?
She exchanges every gift she gets.
lt's impossible to get her
and she loved it.
l remember she cried
when that big dog ran off with--
There was no big dog.
This sucks! l already got her
a briefcase with ''R.G.'' put on it.
Her initials.
Okay, l'm really bad at initials.
You got your shopping done early.
Yeah, well, my Camel Cash
else. Like Ross Geller!
You know what?
lt's a girlie briefcase.
Who cares!
He works in a museum.
The big game's about to start!
Ross and Joey aren't here.
-lce just got in my eye!
People are trying
to sleep in here!
Monica got ice in her eye
and it hurts!
-Open it up. Let me see.
some ice on it.
-lt looks bad.
-We should take you to a doctor.
No, my eye doctor is Richard!
l can't go to him
when l don't have a boyfriend.
He's really picky about his patients.
You've got to go.
of Monica Geller's eye.
ls Richard Burke in today?
He's not in. Will she
see the on-call doctor?
-Yes.
-She's very excited about that!
Okay, we'll be right in.
Okay, so who's gonna take her in?
l'll go, you can watch your parade.
lt's so cool.
the recipe exactly.
Get out of my kitchen.
l think l'm making
some progress with Joey.
When l walked in,
he went to his bedroom...
...but he only slammed the door once.
Yeah, he gave me the finger
ask her a left-handed cooking question.
l'm gonna be in there.
While l'm gone....
Chandler, you're in charge.
l picked Monica for Secret Santa, but
l'm getting her something for Hanukkah.
You want to switch?
l was trying to trade...
...for you.
Really? That's so nice.
What are you getting me?
l don't know, R.G. l was thinking
and she exchanges every gift.
No, l got her lots of stuff
she never took back.
Like?
Like that gold necklace
l got her last year.
When did she wear it last?
She wore it all Christmas day
Chandler bought.
-Even the TV?
-No, l'll put that in my room.
Listen, Joey.
l know what he did was wrong.
But can't you hear him out?
lf Chandler had kissed Rachel,
if you can't do the time.
The guy's your best friend.
Was my best friend.
l don't know why
you're pushing for him.
With him out of the way as
my best friend, there's a spot open.
-Who, me?
l'm going to do as your best friend?
l'm going to get you
to talk to Chandler.
All right.
But if you weren't
my best friend....
Oh, my God. ls it really that bad?
l walk in the room,
the bad words.
l'm so, so sorry.
l feel responsible.
lt's not your fault.
-Gunther, have you seen Chandler?
-l thought you were Chandler.
But one of you is over there.
Hey, Joe.
l'll be right with you.
How cute is the on-call doctor?
So cute that l'm thinking
about jamming this pen in my eye.
-You have the best luck with eye doctors.
-l know.
Dr. Burke will see you now.
Not Dr. Burke.
will see you now.
Ready?
Hey, l'm sorry. That--
-Where you going?
-My folks' .
When you coming back?
l don't know. l might stay there
while l look for an apartment.
What?
l thought we could talk
Should l stop seeing her?
lt's not about her. Okay?
But seeing you together
reminds me of what you did.
l won't live with someone who doesn't
know what it is to be a friend.
l know what it is to be a friend.
then at least stay for them.
They had a very difficult year.
What with the robbery and all.
And that chick used to be very cute.
When that guy was robbing us...
...and l was locked in the
entertainment unit for six hours...
...do you know what l was doing?
l was thinking about
you'd be, l wouldn't have worried.
Wait one second! There has
to be something that l can do.
lf we still had that unit...
...l'd get in it for six hours
and think about how l let you down.
What?
We got a box.
l remember the last time l saw you.
lt was the morning l left for college.
You were standing
-You look great too.
You're an excellent patient.
How does it look?
You have a scratch on your cornea.
You have to wear a patch.
Like a pirate?
lf that helps you.
How long have you been working
with your dad?
Come on, one of us had to mention him.
l moved back here a couple months ago.
Big family dinner tonight?
No way!
l was gonna have Thanksgiving
for a serious commitment.
So you made her walk the plank,
aye, matey?
You're not wearing the patch yet.
l know.
-He's coming here for Thanksgiving?
-l know. lt's sick.
-Why is it sick?
a Greek tragedy over for dinner.
lf it were Greek,
l'd be blind in both eyes.
l like him because he's handsome and
he's nice and smart and handsome.
Phoebe, you understand, don't you?
l could see where l'd be
-Me going out with Richard's son.
lt sounds like a really bad idea to me.
-ls he okay in there?
-He's fine!
lf things work out
between you and Richard's son...
...you can tell your kids...
...that you slept
left a man at the altar...
...loved a gay ice dancer...
...threw a girl's wooden leg
in the fire, live in a box!
What exactly is the point of the box?
The meaning of the box is threefold.
One, it gives me the time
to think about what l did.
Two, it proves how much l care
you guys will be friends again?
Let's just say it's a start.
Remember that necklace
l gave you last year?
Can l see it?
Why?
l just want to check something.
Okay.
Now we'll see.
Air hole! Air hole!
Here it is. l love it.
l wear it all the time.
The necklace l got you was gold.
You actually exchanged it.
lsn't it better to exchange it
for something l enjoy...
...and can use a lot?
What did you get?
Credit.
l'll get it. l'll get it. l'll get it.
l'll get it. l'll get it.
Hi, Tim.
Thank you.
-Well, he's....
He's doing some thinking.
-What happened?
-You kissed my girlfriend!
l like those sunglasses.
''Like them'' like them? Or ''l'd like
to get store credit'' like them?
This turkey is ready.
Where can l wash up?
Let me show you.
The towels are hanging next
-Thank you.
Fancy soap? l thought we were
saving that for the pope.
See. He's nice, right?
Do you want a relationship
where you can actually say:
''That's not how your dad
Where should l sit?
Saved you a seat.
Sick, sick, sick, sick.
l'll get it.
Got you!
That doesn't sound
like thinking to me.
-Sorry!
-You shouldn't be talking at all.
You've got too much thinking to do
if you want to exchange them.
Will you stop!
What's the matter with you?
We've got company.
Nothing's the matter with me.
l'm not completely devoid of sentiment.
l have feelings.
Okay, fine.
You can't tell, but l'm breaking
forget about it.
This means something to me.
lf it doesn't mean anything to you,
then get out of there.
Otherwise, you're just
an idiot in a box.
You're right. l'm sorry.
l swear l won't say another word.
-So you'll take this seriously?
-Absolutely!
That sounds like another word to me.
Are you going to take this seriously?
Okay!
Don't say that l have no sentiment.
This is a movie stub
from our first date.
This eggshell is from the first time
the first time we...
...were together.
Maybe l exchange gifts sometimes,
but l keep the things that matter.
l don't know what to say.
l'm sorry.
Though you're not
looking for that.
-Mind if l smoke?
-Care if l die?
No, l'm just kidding, l'm just kidding.
Go ahead, smoke.
This always happens.
Here, let me.
Thank you.
You have very beautiful...
...eye.
My friends think this is weird.
Even the one in the box?
lt's not weird, is it?
l thought it would be. l almost
that's totally separate.
l totally agree.
We're two people
who find each other...
...very attractive.
Right?
-What?
-Nothing, nothing.
No, really.
-Don't say it!
-lt did, didn't it?
-Yes!
l know!
God, l am sorry. l am so sorry.
lt's okay. lt wouldn't be Thanksgiving
without a little emotional scarring.
You know what's even worse?
My friends were right.
You know what's worst for me is you remind
-lt's okay.
-Chandler's the one l'm mad at.
-Well, l'm still sorry.
-ls he here?
-ln the box.
He can't talk right now.
Why not? What's going on?
He's trying to show Joey
-Joey had reasons.
They were threefold.
You not being able to talk
might make this easier.
Listen....
l don't want to be someone
who comes between two best friends.
l can't stand seeing
the cause of that.
l don't think we can see
each other anymore.
l'm going to my mom's in Chicago.
l'm going to stay there for a while.
l think this could have been
something really amazing.
But, you know, this is
Get out of there! Get out of there!
We're going to be fine.
Get out!
You did some real good
thinking in there.
l mean, this is....
You could still catch her!
And merry Christmas
Because l need to trade.
He sees her!
He's catching up to her.
She sees him!
They're hugging!
He's taking her purse.
That's not them.
l'll go call the police.
There they are!
All right, get a room.
[ENGLlSH]
Come on, no peeking.
Our eyes are closed, and we're
crossing the street. Very good.
Okay. Open up!
What do you want to show us?
Because all I can see
is this bitchen van!
It's for our catering business.
I think I know that girl.
We won't keep it this way, though.
We'll replace the sword
my virginity in that van.
Also, we don't know
what to do with this.
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
The One Where
They're Going To Party!
Remember that guy from cooking school
food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
What an amazing opportunity
to influence...
...dozens of people!
What about our catering business?
It's just one night a week.
Plus, I get to take you out
for free dinners.
Well, in that case....
That was me, hopping on board.
Hey, guys. Hey, Ross!
Quick question for you.
Are you ready to party?
I could maybe go out
on the Discovery Channel.
I don't think you heard me.
Are you ready...
...to party?
No.
Gandalf?
Gandalf is coming to town?
I have nothing to do, so tomorrow
Only the funnest guy in the world.
I'll call to get off work tomorrow.
I'll call after you!
This will be so cool!
We never party anymore.
Were you smoking something
in the back of our van?
"We never have fun anymore"?
And you paid me $ to eat that book?
You are going to love this guy.
Gandalf is the party wizard.
Why do you call him "Gandalf"?
Gandalf the Wizard.
Didn't you read
Lord of the Rings in high school?
No, I had sex in high school.
Joanna? I was wondering if
a buyer in Junior Miss
-That'd be a step down for me.
-Actually, I meant for me.
The hiring committee
is meeting people all day and....
I guess you can't stay
but for different reasons.
I'm so glad you don't have a problem.
If you did, I wouldn't apply.
In that case
That's why I'm glad
there's no problem.
I'm on the hiring committee,
to get that job.
-Really?
-No.
Yeah.
I mean, no.
With your qualifications, you won't
need to sleep with some guy.
Although I might need
I may vomit.
Will you calm down?
He's just a human guy.
You don't understand.
He's amazing.
You never know what'll happen.
You go out for beer
-It's beautiful country up there.
Hey. Okay.
I got my passport, fresh socks,
and a snakebite kit.
It won't be exactly like last time.
I'll see you guys.
I have an audition,
but I'll meet you.
Where will you be around noon?
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Hello.
It's Gandalf!
So are you in town?
Oh, well....
Maybe next time, then.
What happened?
He can't come.
Miss Greene.
I especially like what I see about
implementing a new filing system.
Thank you.
Filing system? Those colored labels
you put on all the folders?
It did brighten up
a lot of important responsibilities.
Joanna really has been
an incredible mentor to me.
Rachel has been incredible
at getting my bagels.
She gets it right almost every time.
Of course, I have more
There's the coffee too.
Rachel can carry two things at once.
That's very good.
Now a big part of this job is...
...cultivating personal relationships,
especially with designers.
-Yes, l
-She shouldn't have any problem.
Her only problem might be getting
What's the difference?
My first review is out.
The Chelsea Reporter.
These used to keep me so warm.
Look, I'm on the back page.
"Would I go back to Allesandro's?
Sure, I'd get two meals.
One for me, and one for the guy
pointing the gun to my head."
You really laid into this place.
They don't pay me a penny
the van for catering.
You want me to go?
It's okay. Are we sure
we don't want the waterbed?
Because it would be silly to take it out
if we're just gonna put it back in again.
Haven't we made this decision?
Yeah, all right.
-Who is it?
-I want to talk to you about your review.
Call me on the phone.
What? So you can hang up on me?
I'll never let you up,
so just go away.
-Just give me a chance to
-Do you need to get in?
No, Phoebe!
Hey, Monica!
I want a retraction.
and one of them eats books.
Our service isn't
"grossly incompetent."
The waiter carried
the breadsticks in his pants.
Well, you said that we accept
I know food, and that wasn't it.
Your marinara sauce tastes
like tomato juice.
You should serve it
with vodka and celery.
I'm proud of that sauce.
and you think that tastes good?
Where are you from?
Lebanon.
Hand me those tomatoes.
I'll show you
what it should taste like.
How long will this take?
I got another critic to yell at.
Joanna, I want to talk
I want to talk to you about.
Now just to brief you...
...I may cry.
But they are not
tears of sadness or of anger...
...but just of us having
this discussion.
Please, don't make a scene.
There's nobody here.
Sophie, get in here.
See? You're making
into completely useless. Get out.
Do you want me to quit?
What makes you think that?
Those things you said
in the interview...
...if you believe them,
I must not be a good assistant.
You know what?
I am just going to pack up my desk...
...and I will be gone
till the end of the day.
Wait, wait.
You can put
your sad little muffin back.
If you must know the truth, I didn't
want to lose a good assistant.
What?
That's why I said those things
after you left.
Said what, exactly?
You enjoy the occasional drink...
...-ing binge.
Oh, my God!
That is it. I'm leaving!
You are just a horrible person!
Wait, wait.
If you're going to get
all sensitive about it.
I don't want to lose you.
What if I create a position for you?
I'll make you assistant buyer
effective tomorrow.
-I need an expense account.
-Done!
-And an assistant.
-Sophie!
Hey, I thought you'd be
to all the foosball players.
I can't believe he didn't come.
So what? We can still go out
and party ourselves.
With Gandalf, we'd be out all night.
We'd meet total strangers
and hang out with them.
We could do that.
There was other stuff too.
We'll do it all and better!
After tonight, Gandalf will want
know how to party!
All right! Let's go.
Maybe we could end up
on a boat again?
All right!
When were we on a boat?
Remember that cold morning
with those dogs licking your face?
Those were seals, man.
How would this suit
came to yell at me.
But I made him sauce, and he
offered me the job as head chef!
You just ruined the thing
I was practicing, but I'm so happy!
Can you believe it?
at Bloomingdale's?
It would totally depend
on her coloring and....
You got the job!
You got the job?
Why didn't you tell me?
It'll be so great!
with walls and everything.
I'm going to have walls!
Is this the day of good news or what?
I got us a job.
The wedding reception.
I kind of need to
talk to you about that.
I think it's time for me to take
and it feels like it's snowballing.
What are you saying?
I got offered the head chef job
at Allesandro's.
It's okay, because
you don't really need me.
You're the cook!
Without you, it's just me
asking for money.
All right. But I'll pay you back
all the money you invested.
-And you can keep the van!
-For what?
I can't believe this!
I got to get out of here.
Phoebe, wait a minute.
I'm an assistant buyer!
We'll get coffee, get energized,
-Okay.
So we're having fun, right?
We don't need that wizard guy.
We hit some clubs,
talk to some strangers...
...then go down to the docks
and see about that boat thing.
I'm kind of beat.
Actually...
...me too.
Are you serious?
Thank God! I'm exhausted.
You guys want coffees?
I don't want to be up too late,
some hot water with lemon?
I strained my voice screaming in there.
Does it have to be so loud?
I can't hear a word.
My ears are ringing so bad.
I was glad I had
in that last place.
How sad are we?
Yeah, I know.
You know what?
We're not sad.
We're just not  anymore.
You know?
I'm  years old, damn it!
I want to sit in a
at a reasonable hour.
I like to hang out in a quiet place
where I can talk to my friends.
And so what if I like to go home,
put on Kenny G and take a bath?
We're .
that you can do with your van.
You could be
a flower delivery person.
-What?
-Or a bakery delivery person?
Pizza?
I got a whole bunch
you don't want to deliver.
-No.
-Okay.
I guess if you
don't want to deliver...
...you probably don't want
-Yeah, I made a commitment to you.
It'd be fun.
It will be fun!
Let's plan the wedding reception.
You really wanted me
to do something with this van.
You know what?
I want you to take the chef job.
-Really?
you're unhappy. I'd be unhappy.
And I really don't want to be
the reason I'm unhappy.
Thank you.
Besides, it might be kind of fun
to form the new A-Team.
Hi, Mrs. Lynch.
Is Joanna in already?
Oh, my goodness!
-Joanna...
...passed away last night.
Oh, my God! How?
She was leaving work,
and she was hit by a cab.
Oh, my God!
I cannot believe it!
I know.
Oh, God.
that you were so close.
Yes. So close!
I know that this is an emotional
and difficult time for all of us.
But by any chance, did Joanna...
...send any paperwork
your way before...
-...it happened?
that curb a few seconds later.
Yes, just a few seconds
and she'd still be with us.
Nothing about an assistant buyer?
I'm sorry. I have to go.
Good morning!
I guess you didn't
hear about Joanna.
I sure did!
I'm excited about having
about having fired Chef Emilio.
It is like losing
a member of the family.
Of course, that literally
is the case for several of you.
Tony, Carlos, Marie...
...please tell your father
of great ideas for this place.
Well, you all read the review.
So without much further ado...
...I present to you
our new head chef.
I just want to say that
with a pinch of excitement...
...a dash of hard work
Did I miss anything?
Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos
in his mouth.
Fifteen?
Your personal best!
Where were you?
On a date.
I met this girl on a train
going to a museum upstate.
-Which museum?
so she'd have to pass by me...
...if she wanted to switch cars.
She was totally at my mercy.
Were you so late because
you were burying this woman?
I'm late because
but she's two and a half hours away.
How can she be great
if she's from Poughkeepsie?
That joke would have killed
in Albany.
Done! I did it.
Who's stupid now?
The One with the
the big Christmas tree tonight.
That paper is two weeks old.
Who keeps leaving old newspapers
in the trash?
I really wanted
to take Kathy to this.
At least you have somebody
this time of year.
Next it's Valentine's Day...
...then my birthday, then bang!
Before you know it, they're
lighting that damn tree again.
I want somebody!
You know, I want a man!
It doesn't even have to be
a big relationship. Just a fling!
I didn't think girls ever
a long time since I've been flung.
I know what I'm giving you
for Christmas.
There are nice guys in my office.
Want me to set you up?
I've been single a long time.
I'm happy.
I no longer go out of my way
to stop others from being happy.
Okay.
No accountants.
And no one from "legal."
I don't like boring jobs.
And Ross was what?
you wrote or something new?
It's the review.
I was making headway.
Everyone was smiling at me,
and then I get off work...
...and find out they wrote this
on my chef's hat.
Maybe they meant to write
since kindergarten.
And they brought in someone from
junior high to do the see-saw with me.
They're trying to make me quit.
If it were any other job, I would.
But I've waited for this
Yell at them. Or fire them!
I would love to, but I can't.
I'm not good at confrontation.
You know what you can do?
I read about this director,
Orson Welles...
...who, at the beginning, would
Why not fire me?
It's a good idea.
Can you waiter?
Good enough to get fired.
All right. You're hired!
That's why I got fired last week!
Does Orson Welles direct commercials?
Yes.
I say, Drew?
I'm not asking you out.
I'm not gay.
I didn't think you were gay.
I do now.
My friend, Rachel,
wants to be set up.
I just got out of
a big relationship.
I'm not looking to get serious.
That's okay. A fling
you took to the Christmas Party?
By the way, that is her full name.
Wow! I'm free for her.
Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.
Let's talk it over
at the Ranger game.
Hold on.
I just got a box of Cubans.
I'll bring them
than I usually stay, but sure.
Before the game, we could enjoy
some eight-year-old Basil Haydens.
I don't know what that is,
but that's a pretty nice jacket.
Kind of like that tie too.
Keep your pants on, man.
I'm writing a holiday song for everyone.
Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.
I know, but it's so hard.
Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
What are you talking about?
Lots of things rhyme with Rachel
Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.
Maypole.
All good. Thanks.
Do you, maybe, have a nickname
"Pumpkin"?
Pumpkin? But did he ever
call you "Budolph"?
Hello, children.
Have I got the  guys for you!
-Really?
-I showed them your picture.
Guys are throwing themselves at me
-Where are the seats?
Wherever! I've got .
Will I like any of these guys?
You know, I'm going to...
...play the field a little bit more.
Guys are signing over
their  Ks to me.
You work with robots?
Yes.
One guy, Patrick, you'll like him.
He's nice, funny and a swimmer.
I like swimmers' bodies.
His dad made the magnetic strip
-He works in fine foods.
-You have a fine foods division?
-It's a big company....
Now, wait a second.
You make food and robots?
No, the robots just work for them.
All right, I'm going to work.
Does anybody have
Fire me?
You bet your ass I'll fire you!
-See you later.
-Thanks.
I should go.
I've got a date.
With who?
You know the girl
two hours away, is pretty...
...really smart and a lot of fun.
But this other girl,
she lives right uptown.
She's just as pretty.
I guess she's smart.
She's not fun.
If she's no fun,
why date her at all?
I want to give her a chance.
she said something that...
...if she was kidding,
was very funny.
If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun.
She's stupid and racist.
How was your first day
-You got it.
What are you doing?
You're still on fire there.
I think you got it!
Chandler, you have
the best taste in men.
Like father, like son.
Patrick and I had such
a great time last night!
This could, maybe, get serious.
I thought you weren't looking
though, right?
You told this guy that
I was looking for a fling?
-You don't tell him that!
-Why not?
I'd be thrilled if some hot girl
I see.
You telling him I want a fling
the wrong idea!
Joey, could you pass the cheese?
I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.
I thought it might be fun
to try out a cool nickname.
Hey, Dragon!
Here's your tips
from Monday and Tuesday.
There's $ in this one.
People get generous
to wear tight trousers.
Could the waiters listen
to the specials?
There's Chilean sea bass
with a mango relish
Why is nobody writing these?
We can remember them.
Because you'll make up fake specials
Here's the thing....
For the last two weeks I have...
...tried hard to create
a positive atmosphere.
Can't hear you!
Positive atmosphere.
But I've had it up to here.
From now on,
it is going to be my way...
...or the highway. All right?
Does anybody have
have a problem with that?
No, ma'am.
He has a name. It's Dragon.
You want to know your name?
Check your hat.
We did the hat, right?
-What the hell just happened?
-I am so sorry.
I was going to do it.
But I was standing there
And I was thinking...
...it's been a long time since I had...
...$ plus $!
We had a deal! It's why you're here.
I've got to fire you!
And I got to pay rent!
How about you don't fire me.
Instead, I stay.
I gain their trust.
They'll listen to the nice things
and I want to fit in.
Happy Hannukah, Chandler and Monica
Merry, merry
You know what, Pheebs?
I'm not Jewish so....
Ross doesn't decorate his tree
with floss...
...but he's not complaining.
Bad dream?
I wasn't sleeping.
What was Phoebe's song about?
It's the one with the cat.
I got to go.
from uptown was making a joke.
It was a different joke.
It wasn't that funny.
So I'm still torn.
You don't like the one from uptown.
And you're exhausted
from dating Poughkeepsie.
Just end them both!
Go to Poughkeepsie
you're done!
You're right. Thank you.
I had a similar problem
when I lived in Prague.
-Prague?
-So much you don't know.
Patrick just ended things with me.
Did you or didn't you tell him
But why?
You don't tell a guy that
you want a serious relationship.
Now you scared him away!
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.
You should never be allowed
I didn't have to lie once.
Really?
You graduated magna cum laude, right?
It doesn't matter.
I got tickets to the Ranger game.
You want to come with me?
Cute guys in little shorts?
Sure.
Actually, it's a hockey team.
Angry Canadians with no teeth.
That sounds fun too.
to ask that question.
The station is Poughkeepsie.
Poughkeepsie!
Ross? Ross?
Wake up!
I need more swordfish.
-Can you get me more swordfish?
-I don't speak English.
-You just did.
-Well, that's not true.
I'm a good person.
And I'm a good chef.
And I don't deserve to have
marinara sauce all over me!
If you want me
-You bet I do!
I just wasn't listening then,
that's all.
If you want a problem,
I'll give you a problem!
What are you going to do?
Get out of my kitchen!
Get out!
All right.
Anybody else got a problem?
How about you, chuckles?
You think this is funny now?
What if I dance covered in sauce?
You think it's funny?
No, it's really good.
Take those salads to table four.
And you, get the swordfish!
And you!
Get a haircut!
Last stop, Montreal.
The stop is Montreal!
What?
I bet myself
Would you like to have coffee?
Are we really in Montreal?
Yes, we are.
So coffee?
Coffee sounds great.
Wait.
So you live in Montreal?
No, but it's only a two-hour
ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
I should have thought
about my wife and kids...
...before I talked back
at the Dragon house this year.
Enough!
Lean, lean, lean!
So this is a very special holiday song...
...that I wrote for some very
important people to me.
Went to the store
Sat on Santa's lap
Asked him to bring my friends
To write them a song
Now you haven't heard it yet
So don't try to sing along
No, don't sing along
Monica, Monica
Have a happy Hannukah
Saw Santa Claus
He said hello to Ross
And please tell Joey
Christmas will be snowy
And Rachel and Chandler
Happy holidays, everybody!
I can't believe
my little brother's married!
Why didn't you tell me
eating lunch
Why were you at the courthouse?
We were having lunch.
We were like...
...we're here, we're having lunch.
Let's get married! Right?
A year ago, I didn't know I had
a brother. Now I have a sister!
Oh, it's so great.
Okay.
Okay.
Stop it! Don't!
I'll get you a gift now.
Is there anything you need?
We've been trying to get pregnant since
able to, you know, conceive.
We've seen a bunch of doctors.
They say that our only chance
to have a baby...
...is that if they take my sperm,
her egg, put it together in a dish...
...and put it into another girl.
We were wondering
We could pay someone...
...but we don't have
that kind of money.
Plus, you know, you're
family and, you know...
...I just don't want my baby to grow into
think about it.
And if you say no,
we'll totally understand.
Okay. Okay.
And we were wondering if you could
give us a ride down to the train station.
Well, actually, we kind of need
Guess what job I just got.
I don't know, but Donald Trump
wants his blue blazer black.
What?
Blue blazer back.
He wants it back.
You said "black." Why would he
Ross got it for me.
Don't you have to be
a dinosaur expert?
They give you
all the information.
It's like memorizing a script.
On your left you have a tyrannosaurus rex,
it's the Cretaceous Period.
But I can pronounce Jurassic.
Frank Jr. and Alice got married!
Oh, my God!
They're having a baby!
They want me to grow it
for them in my uterus!
-My God!
-Are you serious?
You're thinking of
I'm the oven. It's their bun.
What did you say?
I had to think about it first,
but what is there to think of?
I'll be giving someone
the greatest gift.
You'll carry their child
I mean, pregnant.
I know.
You'll put your body
through an awful lot.
I mean, morning sickness, labor.
It's all for somebody else.
Yeah. What's your point?
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
I couldn't do that.
I always figured the first time I had a baby,
it'd be with someone I love.
And that baby was, you know...
...a keeper.
You were more supportive when
we'll be supportive like crazy.
Just think it through.
Talk to somebody who's had a baby.
Like your mom.
My mom never gave birth.
Oh! But my birth mom did!
I love this tushy!
It came with the pants.
I am so jealous.
You guys are just right there.
Yes.
Right where?
The beginning, where
it's all sex and talking...
...and sex and talking.
You got to love the talking.
-And the sex?
-We haven't had sex.
What's the big deal?
before moving to the next level.
Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.
That is really nice...
...Iying!
-No way is that the reason.
-Why?
Because you're not mature enough
to understand that?
He's right. I'm totally lying.
Then what is it?
Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
And you're afraid you won't
make love as well as him.
-I was going for the metaphor.
-I was saying the actual words.
He's had a lot of girlfriends.
Doesn't mean he's great in bed.
We share a wall.
Either he's great, or she liked
great because you're in love.
-Just go for it.
-Yeah, you should.
All right. I'll sleep
with my girlfriend.
But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Now, the mastodon is from
from the Pliocene Epoch?
This is a museum. No talking.
Right down here we have...
...a large foot.
And over here we have Ross Geller.
Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.
Ross is one of our scientists.
Look at him hard at work.
Okay, moving right along.
Come on.
It's open. Come in.
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-That's okay.
I had time to finish
when you're expecting company.
I was working on my pottery.
Oh! I didn't know
that you did pot.
Mostly nudes. It combines
my two passions pottery and erotica.
Erottery!
Thanks for coming out to see me.
I thought it'd be a good idea to
of giving up a baby.
No, no, I understand the pain.
Don't hurt the puppy!
No, no. The puppy is yours.
-I get a puppy?
-But for only three days.
Why?
I realize I don't have any right
It's very important.
I know what I'm talking about.
I gave up two babies.
I only wish I had someone
who'd given up babies that told me...
...how terrible it is.
I really shouldn't have
given you the puppy first.
That's okay.
every day for the rest of your life.
So however hard it is for you
to give up this puppy...
...it'd be a million times harder
to give up a child.
Okay, fair enough. Three days.
Oh, it's time to take
this seat for my friend Ross.
You mean Dr. Geller?
Doctor? I didn't know
he had a nickname.
Oh, he won't sit here.
Only people in white coats
sit there.
Only people in blue blazers
-That's just the way it is.
That's crazy.
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world
a world without lab coats and blazers.
But you not in a perfect world.
You in a museum now.
See that scientist?
He and I used to play together
he don't even hear me!
Everyone's pretending
they don't hear you.
I don't know about your jackets
and separate tables...
...but Ross is my friend.
And if I save him a seat,
I'll catch up with you later.
This is saved.
Gift shop.
I'm really, really sorry about what
happened in the cafeteria today.
You do what you got to do.
The scientists and the tour guides
never sit together.
Whatever.
It's like that everywhere.
eat with the waiters.
And the chefs eat
with the other chefs?
I eat by myself in the alley,
because everybody hates me.
Okay, Rach, when was the last time
with the shipping clerks...
...but it's totally different. They're not
allowed in the executive cafeteria.
Oh, I see what you're saying.
Look, Ross.
It's no big deal.
You wear a white coat.
I wear a blue blazer.
If that means we can't be
the audience, I don't talk to you.
So it's, you know, it's cool.
I'll see you tomorrow.
When we're in the audience,
he doesn't talk but he does wave.
Who's my puppy? Who's my puppy?
Who's my puppy?
-Have you named him yet?
-Sure. Here.
-Come here, squirmy. Hello
-Not like that. No.
Why's Phoebe singing
to Karl Malden?
I think it's time for puppy
Come on, let's go to the street.
Don't go on the balcony
until after I get back.
So did you do it?
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
It was bad?
It was fine, but she didn't agree
with me as strongly as with Joey.
She was like, "l see your point.
the first time.
Yeah. Not for girls, anyway.
Guys agree like that.
Look, you have to help me.
I mean....
I know what to do with a woman.
It's always nice.
I need to know...
...what makes it go from nice to:
"My God! Somebody's killing her
a lot of guys don't know.
All right.
Now.
You don't have to draw an actual
Whoa, she's hot!
Everyone knows the erogenous zones.
You got one, two, three...
...four...
...five, six and seven.
There are seven?
Let me see that.
Oh, yeah.
That's one?
Kind of an important one.
I was looking at it upside down.
Well, you know, sometimes that helps.
Most guys will hit one, two, three
and then go to seven and set up camp.
That's bad?
At Disneyland, you don't spend
is to take your time.
You want to hit them all...
...mix them up.
Keep them on their toes.
Oh, toes!
For some people.
All right.
You could start out
with a little one.
A two.
A one, two, three.
A three.
A five.
A four.
A three, two.
Two. A two, four, six.
Two, four, six.
Four. Two.
Two. Four, seven!
Five, seven! Six, seven!
Seven! Seven!
Seven! Seven! Seven! Seven!
There's a seat here.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips.
But I'm having my lunch...
...at this table.
Here in the middle.
I'm having my lunch...
...right here
with my good friend, Joey.
If he'll sit with me.
I will sit with you, Dr. Geller.
You know...
...we work in a museum
this scientist the error of his ways.
You might even say he took
me on a tour...
...of myself.
Yeah, that was me.
I look around, and you know what I see?
I see division.
Division between people in white coats
the people underneath.
I'm Ross!
I'm divorced and I have a kid!
I'm Joey! I'm an actor!
I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
I'm Ted, and I just moved here,
and New York really scares me.
-There you go!
-Hang in there, Teddy!
I'm Andrew.
And I didn't pay for this pear.
Okay. Good for you.
I'm Rhonda!
-Yeah, okay, Scott!
I flip the light switch on and off
 times when I leave a room...
...or my family will die.
My mom's gonna be here any minute.
I can't. I can't give him up.
Yes, no. I can.
I don't want to.
But I can.
No.
I can't watch this.
It's like Sophie's Choice.
You know, I never saw that.
Oh, it was only okay.
I can't do this.
My mom was right.
I can give up a baby.
Frank and Alice
are going to be so crushed.
What else can I give them?
A kidney!
We were in the neighborhood.
We want to let you know that
to say, we'll be right there.
Who's this little guy?
He's so cute! He reminds me
of my old dog, Tumor.
You are so precious,
I could take you home.
Why don't you?
-Are you serious?
-I'm okay with this.
You know why?
Because look at them.
Look how happy they are.
And I made that, so you know....
It'll be a million times harder
to give up a baby, but oh, my God!
It'll feel a million times
I want to carry your baby.
Thank you so much!
You don't know what this means to us.
I think I'm going to cry!
It's going to be so great.
-What's going on?
-I gave them the puppy.
It made them so happy,
I decided to carry their baby.
-Phoebe
-Yes.
You're not asking me, are you?
-No.
-Yes. Totally.
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you!
Yes, thank you!

What the hell is that?!
What the hell is that?
-Just back off!
Get up! Get up! Get up!
What is that noise?
You!
lt's the chick.
She's going through some changes.
What kind of changes?
The vet seems to think...
...she's becoming a rooster.
We're getting a second opinion.
The One With the Embryos
Why are you shopping
at  in the morning?
l've been up since ...
...thanks to somebody's
dumb-ass rooster.
You should get rid of those animals.
knives and cookbooks around.
l'm going to the doctor
and see if l'm ready...
...to have Frank and Alice's embryo
transferred into my uterus.
How will they know?
They'll just see if my
-That is so not true.
What?
l know it's her laundry day...
...and that means she's wearing
her old-lady underpants.
l can check that for you.
You two think you know
me and Rachel...
...better than we know you.
Well, we do.
You can only eat Tic Tacs
Ross, if you check Rachel's bag...
...you'll find a half-eaten box
of cookies in there.
You're good.
These are not.
l'm so not impressed.
Everybody snacks when they shop.
Ross, how many items
name every item in that bag.
-How many guesses?
-Six.
Challenge extended.
-Deal!
-Challenge accepted.
All right, we'll start with...
...apples.
We'll be starting with apples.
Stop that now.
Yes.
Okay. Tortilla chips.
-Yogurt.
-There's no orange juice! We win!
They have another guess.
Well, we won that one.
Okay. The last thing is--
Not for another two weeks.
l got it.
Scotch...
...tape.
How did you know
she would buy Scotch tape?
We used up theirs last night
making scary faces.
Oh, man!
All right! Ten bucks.
l want a rematch.
And no stupid grocery questions.
Real, personal questions.
And the winner gets $  .
-Serious?
-Are you scared?
No.
Who makes up the questions?
Ross will do it.
Sure, Ross will do it.
lt's not like he has a job
-No, l want to play.
Looks like your uterus
is ready for implantation.
l knew it!
l felt really thick this morning.
Okay, so what's now?
to prepare the embryos.
-Embryos? As in more than one?
-Five, actually.
Where am l giving birth...
...in a hospital or
a big box under the stairs?
Doing five gives you a % chance
% chance of no baby at all?
l was thinking,
what are the odds...
...if you stuff  of them in there?
Sweetie, now...
...she's a woman,
not a gumball machine.
Don't worry. l'll do this as many
only have one shot.
lt costs $  , each time you do this.
Sixteen thousand dollars?!
Well, it's  in California.
We're kind of using all the money
we have to do it this one time.
Okay, that's a lot of
pressure on me and my uterus.
Maybe there's something l can do

Why don't you get drunk? lt worked
for a bunch of girls in my high school.
-So how's the test coming?
-Hey, you're touching the game board.
Sorry.
You freak.

Well, believe it, baby!
-Well, l'm not moving.

We have to move.

Cool! Girl roommate.

So you been doing this long?
No. You're my first.
Put the money on the table.
That's nice.
Dude!
-ls that an expensive blouse?
-lf you want it to be.
Here's your girlfriend's button.
The One with Rachel's Crush
Do you still have your old blouses
here somewhere. Why?
Maternity clothes are so expensive.
Rach, I made a pile of your stuff.
If you could just...
...throw your purses at it.
Bloomingdale's eliminated
my department.
Are you out of a job?
No, but they stuck me in Personal
and tell them what to buy?
That sounds great!
We switched apartments. You can't eat
our food. That gravy train has ended.
There's gravy?
If you have the big apartment, you
have to deal with people coming over.
That fridge has to be stocked.
-I think I left a doughnut up here.
How was Kathy's play?
Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex
with a real good-looking guy.
It's like somebody wrote down
my worst nightmare...
...and then charged me $ to see it.
That's a good idea for a business.
I'm totally screwed. They're gonna be
and he's gonna try to undermine me.
He'll be like, "Where's your boyfriend?
What's his name? Chester?"
She'll go, "It's Chandler."
He'll go, "Whatever!"
That is a good trick.
All right, look.
They're there to do a job.
It doesn't mean they're
gonna get together.
Just because it happened with
Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins...
...doesn't mean it's gonna
It's much different with plays.
You were in acting class
together, and she slept with you.
Acting class is a lot more
like a movie than a play.
When they were doing it on stage,
are actually doing it off-stage...
...then all the sexual tension
between them is gone.
As long as it's hot on stage,
you got nothing to worry about.
When the heat goes away,
in. Have I ever had chemistry on stage?
-No.
-No!
Are you gonna go see
the play with me tonight?
I don't know how comfortable I am going
-No, I'm there.
-Want some pancakes?
-You made pancakes?
Grab a plate.
No, no. Stay right there.
Getting closer.
Don't worry...
...we also have cereals,
muffins, waffles and...
...jams, jellies and marmalades,
opened everything.
We're watching the game here Saturday
night, if people wanna come over.
I was thinking about having people over.
Yeah? Who's playing?
The players.
Somebody seems to be missing
being the hostess.
Please. It's a relief, is what
a thong, and she didn't even buy it.
I'm quitting.
I'm talking to my boss right now.
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.
Okay, bye. Call me when you
get this message.
Mr. Waltham?
I really need to talk to you.
In a moment, please.
What could I do for you, Joshua?
I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife
Well, my ex-wife
I'm so sorry.
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes.
I got away with this suit
and what turned out to be a skirt.
Well, at least that's a great suit.
It wasn't much fun dropping
If you're willing, I'm all yours.
Okay.
You needed to speak to me?
No, no, that wasn't me.
We should get started.
Let me show you my underwear.
The selection of underwear
that we carry.
I'm sorry.
-It's this way.
no chemistry between them.
Before, they had heat.
Now, there's no heat.
You know what this means.
Joey told us what this means.
Let's not jump to any conclusions.
It was like cousins having sex.
Here she comes. Don't say a word.
Just be cool. Don't be, you know, you.
Hey, you guys!
Thank you so much for coming again.
-Did you like it tonight?
-Absolutely.
Wasn't Nick funny when
You were great.
And Nick, ditto.
Clearly, you're having sex with him.
Okay....
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
It was so obvious.
There was no chemistry between you two.
You're accusing me of cheating on you,
and you're insulting my performance?
I can see how this could happen. You're up
How can you not trust me?
You can understand,
given how we started.
I can't believe you're
throwing that in my face.
That is what happened.
You call me when you grow up.
Don't expect that to happen
any time soon!
I have the best job
in the entire world!
The most adorable guy came over,
doll and bump them together...
...and make kissing noises.
He's got the most beautiful name.
I never realized. Joshua.
Joshua.
Joshua. Josh.
Hello?
Hi.
What do I smell?
I don't know. It smells good.
Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven.
Please, have some.
I've been fiddling around here,
making delicious treats for everyone.
The new Playboy.
Just something I picked up.
Cookies and porn?
V-necks, but you had to be there.
How does Jason look in a V-neck?
-It's Joshua.
-Whatever.
Wait. Wait. This isn't takeout!
-Hate to eat and run.
-No, wait. Please, don't go!
I've got porn for you too.
I don't need it.
People are supposed to want
I'm always the hostess.
Even when I was little, the girls
brought their dollies to my tea party.
I served the best air.
Why'd you make a big thing out of everyone
hanging out in the big apartment?
'Cause they took our apartment.
have just made them hang out here.
That is true.
This place is gonna be  times
better than that place.
Are we gonna
trash their place?
There's steps!
Slut!
You'll all be very happy to hear
-You were right?
I confronted her,
and she didn't deny it.
I don't live here!
Wait, are you sure?
I may be drunk,
but I know what she said.
Then I went over
-Yes!
You and l
Man, I am so sorry.
The bartender taught me
a trick, though.
I don't remember it.
-Do you need help with that?
and he has not asked me out.
-Just so frustrating.
-Why don't you ask him out?
Totally. That's such a turn-on.
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
That's the turn-on.
He just got a divorce. Right?
He's probably really nervous around women.
Maybe you just need to
-You've never asked a guy out?
No. Have you?
Thousands of times!
That doesn't make me
sound too good, does it?
I don't even know
how I would go about it.
What I do is, I look a woman
I'm gonna call him up and ask him out.
I can do that, ask him out.
"How you doing?"
Hi, Joshua.
It's Rachel Greene from Bloomingdale's.
I was just wondering if you...?
If you...
...Ieft your wallet
at the store today?
We found a wallet, and we
The license? That is a good idea.
Well, let's see.
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
-You've done that a thousand times?
-I've never done that.
I just got so nervous that he'd say no.
You gotta give him something
he can't say no to, like...
...Knicks tickets. Invite him to a Knicks
-Absolutely. And if not, can I go?
What the heck is that?
Did she call?
No. Sorry.
Maybe I should call her.
Forget her, man. You don't need her.
He's right.
What she did was unforgivable.
Well, yeah, but, you know,
what if I was wrong?
How might you be wrong?
What if she didn't actually
I saw the play. There was no heat.
-Back me up.
-That's all you're basing this on?
That's not backing me up!
Look, you said,
"With the offstage and the heat"
That was just a theory. There's a lot
to a basketball game with?"
"It's funny, basketball,
because I happen to have tickets"
"Who likes the Knick?"
What do you think?
Well, as a single woman,
who is available...
...I think you look great.
Oh, yeah. You look great.
This looks great.
So you like it?
I do. I love it.
-Thank you so much for all your help.
Well, I guess this is it.
Thanks.
Maybe I'll see you in the spring
for the bathing suits.
You don't want to do that now?
That's okay.
I'll see you around sometime.
Basketball!
Sorry?
I have two tickets to the
Knicks game if you're interested...
...just as a thank-you for this week.
That would be great!
-Really?
Thank you so much, Rachel.
Good morning.
I just wanted to come over
to say that I'm sorry.
I acted like the biggest idiot
in the world.
I can completely understand
and now we can move on.
I know for me, but
Nick's pants?
I think our second fight
is going to be a big one!
-For next time, what do you say?
-"l have an extra ticket."
"An extra ticket."
he turned you down?
He didn't turn me down.
He's at the game.
I got the date.
I'm just not on it.
Okay, it's ready.
-Come on.
Looks the same.
You used to have carpet.
Oh, yeah.
I made snacks.
Please, just hang out.
I'm just gonna rest my eyes
for just a little bit.
Do you want us to come back later?
No, no, no. Stay.
Just keep talking.
I'm always the hostess.
How'd it go?
-She wasn't sleeping with him.
-I'm saying that she is a devil woman.
You think you know a person, then they
turn around and sleep with Nick.
Nick and his rock-hard pecs
and his giant man-nipples.
I hate him.
This is all my fault.
How? How is it your fault?
I should have called.
If I had called her, she never
would have gone out with Nick.
They wouldn't have ended up in bed.
I threw her at his man-nipples!
This is not your fault.
Your fight does not
they were on a break....
Rachel, one of your customers seems to
have left his billfold, a Joshua Burgen.
Really?
-Will you call him?
-Yes, I will. Absolutely.
Hello, Rachel.
Hi, Joshua.
-I left my wallet here on purpose.
something to you.
Yes?
"How you doing?"
So, what is this?
Googlie Worm.
And this?
Glow Pop Jiggly Jam.
It's so funny!
What's this?
A hunk of sandwich from last year.
Geller's got one hooked!
Looks like a big one!
It's the classic struggle
between man
Someone knocked over a lamp.
You know what'll be great
doing with your life?"...
...I can say, "I'm doing a movie
with Charlton Heston.
What about you?"
Don't stop having fun
just because I'm here.
Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.
Well, except you.
You know what is so sweet? Those birds
They broke up only two days ago.
Go fishing next week.
There's nothing I can do.
He's still in his sweats.
That's only phase one.
I'll be back for phase two.
I'd never miss that.
Phase two?
Getting drunk
make him better?
There are naked ladies there.
Then to phase three
seeing yourself with other women.
There are naked ladies there too.
Would you give me one minute, please?
The One with Joey's Dirty Day
These will match the jacket
you picked out last week?
There we go.
There it is.
You know what I need?
-Could I have a moment?
My niece, you see,
is in town from London.
Shropshire, but you know.
She's about your age, I'd say.
Anyway, I have tickets for the opera.
Die Fledermaus.
Would you like to keep her
Fledermaus. Great!
Yes, of course.
Thank you so very much.
So?
-Gloves?
-Sorry, I'll be right back.
Actually, I got to take off.
I was curious.
It opens tonight. Want to come?
That would be great!
You're into hard-core S & M, right?
-Well, I guess.
-I'm kidding.
I'll put you on the VlP list.
Look for me.
Great! You bet.
I'll see you tonight.
-I almost forgot the tickets.
Die Fledermaus.
Oh, right.
You'll like it.
It has two out of the three tenors.
I can't believe
Kathy did this to me.
I really thought she was the one.
I'll tell you what.
I'm not getting out
My sweatpants.
Just take the sweats off, okay?
Take them off
and we'll have some fun.
Wow, and I can't resist that line.
That's why I never wear sweatpants.
Did you catch any fish?
You guys have no idea.
-You stink!
Plus, I fell in a big tub of worms!
How's he doing?
He hasn't left
that chair in two days.
Hey, buddy, how's it going?
You see? He just needed
his pal to come home.
I got to memorize my lines.
Me and Charlton Heston,
fancy club opening tonight.
But I already told Mr. Waltham...
...that I would take his niece
to the dumb old opera.
So, what are you going to do?
-I don't know.
-No! Help me!
-I can't. I have to work.
my morning sickness in the evening.
Unless she wants to spend the night
holding my hair back for me.
You guys, come on!
I have to meet Joshua.
It's my one chance for him
if she were my wife?" Rachel.
Are Joey and Chandler back?
Chandler's still in phase one,
and Joey's that thing you smell.
So....
No.
Come on!
-She's here.
-Wait, wait.
Ross, please?
You want me to take some girl
and flirt with some guy?
That is a toughie.
She's looking down the hall.
She looked right at me.
You can't see people
through that hole, can you?
I'll be right there!
Okay, Ross, please.
I thought we had moved on.
I thought we could be happy
I'm Rachel Greene.
Thank goodness!
There's been a teeny change of plans.
I'm not free tonight
Really?
I must've missed your call, though
I didn't leave the flat all day.
Well, l
That's not rude.
by one of your wiener carts...
...and been strip-searched
at the airport.
Apparently, I look like someone who's
got cocaine stuffed up their bum.
I think you look great.
Good night.
the way they talk?
-What?
-The baby kicked!
Oh, my God.
No, wait. The elastic
in my underwear busted.
Oh, my God! I overslept!
I was supposed to be
You stink!
I fell asleep.
Now I don't have time!
Just  blocks away.
If I run, I'll make it.
Run  blocks.
No, keep moving.
How did it go last night?
Well, I didn't see Joshua.
But I did punch a girl in the face.
The whole night was horrible.
It was pouring.
There was no Rachel Greene on the list.
But there was a Rachel Greep.
So did you get to meet her?
There is no Rachel Greep.
And he let her in.
So you hit her?
No, she was already in.
This big bitch behind me
tried to steal my umbrella...
...so I clocked her.
All I wanted was a few hours...
...outside of work to see Joshua...
...so he could go ahead and
start falling in love with me.
Pheebs.
Honey, that's your name.
That's short for Phoebe? I thought
-That's right.
Where are the guys? I'm ready
to get drunk and see strippers.
They got a breakfast buffet.
Let me talk to him!
-Oh, my God!
-Can't I just?
-It's my phone and she's shush
No.
When we first met her,
she was soaking, her feet were wet....
Who wouldn't be miserable?
I'm telling you, once l
got her into a dry pair of shoes...
...she was a totally different person.
They're in Vermont?
with that witch?
Maybe she doesn't hit him
all the time.
There's a deer outside
eating fruit from the orchard!
I got to go! There's a deer
eating fruit from the orchard.
I don't get this.
She was horrible!
I'm going to go stand over there.
Why do you care?
I don't care.
I'm just upset that
I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.
You do not just meet someone
you flitted off to Vail.
Could you, just for once...
...not remember every little thing?
So you know, when's he getting back?
A couple of days.
I knew something
like this would happen.
What are you doing?
You can't go back a phase!
You're thinking about time.
You can't go back in time.
Why don't you do your phase two
Maybe we want to be guys.
No, you don't. You'd be all
hairy and wouldn't live as long.
Would you just stop being
such a wuss and get those off?
And come with us
I'm here.
Calm down, we got time.
We're running late.
All set.
Look at that.
Charlton Heston eating licorice.
Yeah, he loves them.
What smells so bad?
You.
I could see why you would think that.
But you know who it is?
You?
No, no. It's Heston.
What?
He reeks like he went on a three-day
fishing trip, then ate licorice.
No way. He's the only one
You want to put them in her panties?
No, thanks, Mom!
That.
You have to put that out
because I'm pregnant.
Maybe you and your baby
ought to go to another strip club.
It's not my baby.
Very good.
Really good. I enjoyed it.
and Joshua didn't call.
You'd think he'd be worried
about me not showing up.
You know what makes it worse?
Ross is all happy in Vermont.
Come on, look where you are!
Another round of daiquiris.
Virgin for me.
Don't let me leave without
the name of that carpet guy.
Come on!
You know what?
In a few hours, I'll be drunk.
I'll want to call her.
You'll have to stop me.
Then I'll be so drunk,
I'll want to call Janice.
You should! How is she?
I think somebody needs
if I said I was Kirk Douglas?
Put some pants on, kid,
so I can kick your butt.
No, wait. You don't understand.
I'm an actor.
Joey Tribbiani.
I'm doing a scene with you today.
And I stink!
You're in this picture?
I'm a cop who won't work with you
sometimes thought he stank.
Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
You don't understand.
Listen to me.
I don't know one actor
worth his salt...
...who, one time in his career,
didn't say, "God, I stink!"
I just did a scene out there.
and you must remember...
...no matter how badly
you think you stink...
...you must never, ever bust into
my dressing room and use my shower!
Do you understand me?
-Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.
at the strip club, right?
Great. Thanks to you,
the hottest waitress is quitting...
...to teach the third grade!
-He still hasn't called.
-Who, Josh?
It's Joshua.
-He doesn't like "Josh"?
You were right.
We weren't great at being guys.
You know why?
Because we're girls.
-You know what girls are good at?
-Stripping!
No, listening!
Sit.
Maybe it would really, really help
What's going on in there?
And you know, if you want to cry,
that's okay too.
I'm going to have
to ask you all to leave.
Forget it. We tried,
couldn't picture myself with them.
They really were pretty,
weren't they?
-I liked that fighter pilot one.
-Candy?
She was so spunky!
I think if I were going
like Michelle.
She was just so petite.
For me, it would have to be Chantal.
She had the smoothest skin.
I stuck that dollar in
her G-string and grazed her thigh
Phase three!
I just achieved phase three!
I am totally picturing you
-I don't want a relationship ever!
I just want sex
with strippers and my friends!
Come on.
Let me see that smile.
I don't want to.
Please?
I wanted to go to the strip club!
You'll have plenty of chances.
There are thousands of women out there,
just waiting to screw me over.
Yeah, all right.
How was Vermont?
Emily is...
...incredible. There are
finally being in a place...
...where we could really
be happy for each other.
I admit, I wasn't quite there.
The thought of you
and that Josh guy
Joshua.
Joshua guy at that club,
I'm so glad I could help, you know?
I'm happy for you.
Happy for you.
Oh, no, happy for you.
All right. Here's what we'll do.
You are going to take off
my clothes.
You two, go get the oils.
And you, just constantly scream...
..."Chandler's the king!
Chandler's the king!"
I want to be with her.
Go with your instincts!
What am I doing again?
Pay attention.
I could wake up at any moment.
I'm Joshua.
I'm here to pick up Rachel.
That's not Joshua.
What do you want from me?
have a lot of work to do.
What are you doing?
All right, listen.
I got to wake up.
I'm getting my nails done!
You said it was going to be fun.
Which it kind of is.
You said there would be guys.
There are no guys.
There's one right over there.
That's a mailman!
That's our mailman!
Hi, how are you....
Don't worry. This doesn't
when this broke off?
You know who had nails like that?
Oh...
...my...
...God!
The One with All the Rugby
Joey, let me ask you a question.
What does this light switch do?
Nothing.
Did it drive you crazy
to not know?
I know what it did.
Nothing.
They put it there for something.
knob on the toilet do?
It flushes it.
Since you know, when you come over,
would you use it?
-Hello.
-Hey.
-Oh, my God. Wow.
-ls this amazing?
-How have you been?
-Well, I'm divorced.
Oh, wow.
I'm riding the alimony pony.
And there it is.
I just came up to say "hi."
Sweetie, I'll see you later.
I'll see you tonight.
-Bye.
-Bye.
-Bye.
I thought you were crazy about her!
But you know all those annoying
things she did before?
Her voice, her laugh
and her personality?
They're all back!
And she's picked up, like,
There's people here!
Don't worry.
I'm taking care of it.
You are not!
You never break up with her.
I don't have to break up.
We're not involved.
before it starts.
My ass is, like, frozen!
Try sticking it in the freezer
for  minutes.
I'm telling you!
I can't believe
you walk alone here at night.
-You hear such stories about New York.
feel perfectly safe.
Help! Help!
No, no, Ross!
These are friends from home.
Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
-Hi, mate.
-How are you, man?
That was a good one, huh?
"Help! Help!"
How are you?
I've been meaning to ring you
since that U concert.
Oh, my God. You're right.
Actually, the last time we saw
each other was the next morning.
Oh, Liam!
Oh, Liam.
So were you guys playing soccer?
Or should I call it "football"?
We were playing rugby.
In fact, we're playing tomorrow.
You're welcome to play.
Ross play rugby?
You don't have rugby here.
Well, we didn't have freedom
here until  either, so....
So, good!
We'll see you at the park at two.
Cheers!
Oh, boy! I just love to sing.
Yes, I know you do.
The reason people complained...
...was because they paid to hear
a station at th Street Nails?
Okay, we have to talk.
I'm just getting out of
a very serious relationship.
I know. And I'm just
getting out of a marriage.
Talk about "meant to be."
Right. But I think this
get away this time.
I hear you!
But...
...unfortunately...
...my company...
...is transferring me overseas.
Oh, no!
Where to?
To Paris?
No, not Paris.
To London? Rome? Vienna?
Barcelona?
Could you just stop talking
for a second?
Yemen.
That's right. Yes!
I'm being transferred to Yemen!
When?
I don't know exactly.
Well, I will just have to
that moment comes.
But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.
-Done?
-Yep!
What's up?
This switch is
driving me crazy.
I turned it off
one is controlled by the switch.
So I plugged things in the outlets
that make noise.
That way, when I turn it on,
I just follow the noise.
Bet I stopped listening first.
You know, you also could
Where is it?
It's coming from Joey!
Oh, my God! That's so freaky!
Turn him off!
Could we put on the news?
It might be raining.
Hold on. I'm watching
get the channel that carries the sport.
Hey there, Ross!
Janice.
You know, you really didn't
have to help me pack.
When you said all you'd be doing
before you leave is packing...
...you really didn't
but I guess I did not.
What's going on?
I'm packing, you know,
because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Thanks for telling me!
I'm going to be pretend-moving
to Yemen. To get rid of her.
Good one!
Yemen! That actually sounds
underwear and stuff it in your shoes.
It's a space-saver.
I do that because
it makes me look taller.
Come on!
-Joey, trade lives with me.
-Nope.
Ross, I can't believe
playing badminton with my dad.
That's because your mom's dog
kept looking at me.
Look! Right here,
it's called a "scrum."
It's like a huddle.
And is a hum like a scruddle?
Ross, they're going kill you!
Why are you doing this, anyway?
You should've seen the guy
That's funny!
Oh, I see. You did that.
She thought the very idea of me
playing rugby was hilarious.
So I'll show her
how tough I really am.
I'm sorry.
It's not like he's Chandler.
Thanks.
Don't worry about me.
I'll just look energetic
and stay away from the ball.
I'll be that guy,
right outside the circle.
Maybe there was a dog
and that guy...
...and that one.
Dude, they're all huge!
They're no bigger than me.
You're closer to you. So you look
bigger to you from where you are.
I'm going to go say "hello."
I kind of liked it.
I know what to do.
I've got to go Red Ross.
You know, Red Ross?
Totally don't know.
That time we were in line
and I just lost it?
Screamed at him, turned all red!
Red Ross!
You'll see!
Liam, do me a favor.
Go easy on Ross.
It's his first time.
You don't say?
Good luck, babe.
Come on, get in here!
Come on!
Come on, get in the bloody scrum!
Ross, get in!
Joey!
You're not going to believe it!
Joshua came in today, and guess what?
He asked you out?
But I showed him some cuff links,
-Electrical plans for the building.
Okay, should I be scared?
I know that switch does something.
I got these from City Hall.
I just paid $
and waited for three hours.
Wow! If only more people knew!
All right, do you understand any of this?
No, I don't understand any
-I don't know.
That looks like a bunny though.
You really didn't have to
take me to the airport.
Oh, please.
Every moment is precious.
Besides, someone had to ride
that you're leaving.
We're not that close.
Okay. So I guess this is goodbye then.
Oh, no!
It's not goodbye. I'm not leaving
till you get on that plane.
Okay. Well, I guess
it's just "wait here" then.
I need a fake ticket to Yemen.
One ticket?
I just need a pretend ticket.
I'm sorry.
to play with?
Are you traveling with a child?
No.
She'll think I'm
handing you a credit card.
But what I'll really hand you
is a library card.
A ticket to Yemen is $,
Is something wrong?
Do you have to stay?
American Express?
I can't believe they're doing that!
I told them to go easy on him!
No offense, but sometimes it's hard
to understand you, with the accent.
That's just halftime.
That is one fun game!
Do me a favor?
Grab me some water?
Thanks!
I think I'm dying.
I really do.
Poor baby!
Tell my son that I love him.
Excellent!
You have to stop!
No! I'm not stopping.
I'm Red Ross!
Dude, you go back out there,
you'll be Dead Ross.
I'm not quitting.
at least let me help you.
It's no place for a woman.
Those guys will grab anything!
That's not it. I just know a few
things that can help you inflict pain.
I like that.
Listen closely.
Devon has got a weak ankle.
One swift kick and he'll back off.
Bad ankle. Got it!
And that big bloke with the beard?
he doesn't wear a cup.
I could use that.
Trick hip, no cup. Okay!
And Liam's got bad knees. Hit him right
and he'll go down like a lamp.
But Liam's on my team.
-I don't care. Just get him!
I made and hung up.
I thought they'd brighten up the place.
Don't they?
No, don't.
There's no hole there.
I just really like that picture.
Oh, my God! Look at this!
But there is a wire there!
come loose in your head!
If I could follow the wire,
I'd find out what it did.
And did you?
No.
It disappears behind there.
For a minute, I thought
it went downstairs.
Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis.
-Hello, darling.
don't want a doctor?
No, that'll just bring me down!
This was great! I was great!
This was a great day!
I'm buying everyone coffee.
Just grab my wallet.
It's in my pocket.
No, not you.
Your eye's still popping out.
I'm so in the mood for ice.
You were amazing out there.
I kind of was, wasn't l?
Oh, my God!
I made a man twice my size cry!
I haven't done that since I was four and
I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
You really enjoyed yourself,
didn't you?
Are you kidding?
-I think you've got a concussion.
No, I'm serious.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry.
Did that hurt you?
It's worth the pain.
You know what? It's not.
This is the final boarding call
an energy source to replace fuel.
I'll write you every day.
 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Okay. Goodbye.
Janice! There you are!
I had to have one last kiss.
And also, you said you'd leave
after I got on the plane!
No. I want to see you take off.
Well, then I guess
can I stay with you?
All right. The super couldn't
figure out what it did.
The $-an-hour electrician
couldn't figure out what it did.
I've had seven
I am totally doing it!
I lost it.
Cereal killer.
Cereal killer?
Hey, come on, I say more
dumb things before  a.m...
...than most people say all day.
What?
I can't find anything that I wanna eat.
Everything makes me nauseous.
I'm telling you, being pregnant
It's coming from the bathroom.
Pregnancy does give you
some weird cravings.
It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen, there's
something in here I want to eat.
What smells so good?
-ls it the shampoo? It's guava.
The baby wants meat. I can't eat meat.
Wait!
Maybe it's the pickle!
The One With the Fake Party
What are you writing?
Joshua's coming in tomorrow, and since
I don't have the guts to ask him out...
...I'm gonna sell him a coat
and put this note in the pocket.
"Joshua, give me a call sometime.
-What have you guys been up to?
We went to see a collection of
Victorian doorknobs at the museum.
Without me?
My uncle dragged us there,
but it turned out to be really interesting.
They were so ornate and beautiful.
but here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
I got it from the gift shop.
They have really lax security there.
It's a joke.
Anyone for more tea?
No, just me then.
Hey, Ringo.
Every time Emily's around, you talk
like her. Would you please cut it out?
I think you like it.
I think you can't resist me when I do it.
You want to eat me up
like a cream "pumpy."
-What?
I'll see you. Bye-bye, then.
Bye-bye, then.
You guys seem to be having a good time.
She is amazing,
and she's so much fun.
And you know what?
When I'm with her, I'm fun!
I do things like run off to Vermont...
...and you guys saw the doorknob.
I even signed up
I don't have to do it.
Two days?
You must be bummed.
She's got to go back to London, but
I've been prepared for this from the start.
We both knew we had two weeks together,
my relationships are like.
Yes, but in Ross' case,
they both know in two weeks that's it.
-Pheebs!
-Hello. Hello.
No, I know. Yeah.
So the baby is totally craving meat.
I tried tricking it, and I made it a soy burger,
cool, pregnant-lady glow.
That's sweat. You throw up all morning,
you'll have that glow too.
Okay.
-Here's that trench coat that you wanted.
-Great.
It's comfortable.
You could really
the pockets until you are out of the store.
Why not?
Well, because...
...we get a lot of
They ruin it for everybody.
I know.
I wore that sweater
on a date last night.
It was the first date
since the divorce.
Congratulations.
but it made me realize...
...I'm just not ready to be dating.
That's interesting.
-What was that?
-Just an anti-theft device.
Then what's this?
You need that too, because
a thief could just tear this up.
We have to have a party in five minutes,
a bon-voyage party for Emily.
But it's actually for Joshua.
That sucks. Nobody's ever thrown me
a bon-voyage-Emily party.
He said he's not ready to date.
So I had to invite him to a party
if I wanted to see him outside of work.
And now I have created
to meet Josh and warn him...
...Emily and I won't be here.
She's gonna come by to say goodbye...
...and then I've got a special evening
planned. Sorry. No party.
-Hello?
a surprise party before.
Well, it was all Ross' idea.
You're so sweet.
And I'm so surprised.
You didn't know?
Why are you over here
if Joshua's over there?
I'm trying to play hard-to-get.
Quick! He's looking.
Say something funny.
Like what?
What's so funny?
I said, "Like what?"
Now that's a thinker.
This playing-hard-to-get thing
-No, thanks.
I can tie one of these into a knot
using just my tongue.
You okay?
You all right?
We should probably get going soon.
But the party's just getting started.
We have to be at The Four Seasons
for drinks in  minutes.
Then The Plaza for dinner.
So why did you plan a party
are very short.
It's usually, "Surprise!"
Then, "My God, I'm so surprised. Bye!"
Ross, I'm having such a great time.
Your sister told me that
you used to dress up like old ladies...
...and host make-believe
that when she was little...
...she was partially responsible for
new legislation...
...regulating the strength
of swing sets?
Then what are you going
-Oh, yeah.
What goes on top of the salami?
Pastrami.
You're a genius.
Give me a hand with the zipper.
Up!
-You changed?
-I decided I needed my lucky dress.
-Lucky means more cleavage?
-lt does for me.
Look at him!
without him knowing I like him?
I know how you can get him.
Take off your bra.
What?
-This scene in Footloose
-Flashdance.
-Yeah. With that plumber girl?
and pulls it out the sleeve.
Very sexy. And classy.
-Or you could use mistletoe.
-It's not Christmas.
-Spin-the-bottle.
-He's not .
Thank you so much for this.
-I'm gonna take off too.
You can't leave yet.
You have to stay.
We've got the whole
big thing planned.
What big thing?
Spin-the-bottle works like this
so I would have to kiss Gunther.
All right.
Who wants to go first?
I'll go.
Welcome to America.
Oh, my God!
Two in a row!
You gotta use your tongues now.
All right.
What are the odds?
That's enough!
Let's let someone else play.
If you didn't want to play,
then why'd you come to the party?
All right, I'll go.
Somebody loose.
If it kicked once, it'll kick again!
Everybody just remember
where they were sitting.
It was a bug.
It doesn't matter
how much I'm craving it.
You know why I'm never gonna eat meat?
The baby needs the meat.
You know when you're dating someone...
...and you don't want to cheat
unless it's with someone really hot?
Totally.
This is the same kind of deal.
If you're gonna do something wrong...
...do it right.
-I'll be back in a minute.
-Okay.
What are you doing to me?
I'm trying to get Emily out of here,
and making her laugh.
I don't want you to be funny anymore.
Rachel wants me to be funny,
you don't want me to be funny.
From now on, I'm gonna be funny
sometimes, and not funny others.
You feel better now?
Yeah, but at what cost?
Six more months, three meals a day.
I am going to eat, like,
baby cows. No veal!
Oh, but veal.
What if I even things out
for you, meat-wise?
-What?
-I eat a lot of meat, right?
But suppose, until the baby's born,
You'd be eating my animals.
I can't believe you'd do that for me.
Absolutely.
I could be a vegetarian.
There's no meat in beer, right?
We can still make dinner if we skip the
appetizers and ask for our check right away.
We can't go now.
Have you lost your mind?
I am finally thinking clearly.
My lucky dress wasn't working out
too well for me.
But for four years,
this baby never missed.
Wait, I can't let
Actually, I want to see what happens.
Nice costume.
Well, I wanted to give Emily
It's no big deal. I have a dentist.
I'll put some ice on it.
Excuse me.
-What do I do now?
-I think you're done.
Time to take off the bra.
That was really great.
But I gotta take off.
Take the bra off.
Let's go get your coat.
Rachel's my girlfriend.
So this was really fun.
Yeah, it was real fun.
You know, this bra...
...is really bothering me.
This used to be my bedroom.
A lot of memories in here.
they'd say
"Want to hear some memories?"
Need a hand?
I got this all under control.
You really don't seem like you do.
God! Forget it!
This is not how
this was supposed to happen.
What was supposed to happen?
Can you not look at me
when I say this?
I thought that
-Seduce you.
I don't wear suits to work.
And I bought six of them from you.
I'm sorry.
I thought you needed them.
My point is, I kept coming back
because I wanted to see you.
-Why?
and smart and sophisticated.
A lot of this isn't based on tonight.
But you like me?
I can't believe this. All this time,
I liked you and you liked me!
-But
-No "but."
"But" is never good. Let's leave it
-No, that's a fancy "but."
My marriage, like, just ended.
And I'm really not ready
to get into anything yet.
But....
I'm sorry.
I just need a little time.
Okay.
There you are.
so you and Emily are free to go.
It's okay.
She's still in there
enjoying her fake party.
It's too late to do
the stuff I had planned.
I'm sorry.
I made a fool of myself.
Helps a little.
Is there room on that step
for a pathetic loser?
Have a seat.
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.
It was just a two-week thing anyway.
I just didn't want it
We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.
No commitment.
That girl just spent the entire evening
talking to your friends...
...asking to hear stories about you...
...Iooking through
Monica's photo albums.
You don't do that
until she has to be at the airport.
And you're sitting here
in a hallway...
...with a -year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.
You're right.
Thanks.
What photo album was it?
I don't know. It was you
Those weren't albino kids.
That was computer camp!
-You're a pathetic loser, right?
-Oh, yeah.
Sit!
Hi.
Oh, my God. Joshua.
Look...
...all those things I said
about not being ready
-They're not true?
and get some coffee?
Okay.
Every time.
-What do you got there?
-Pastrami.
-You know what goes good with that?
-Corned beef.
I was going to say bologna.
-Okay.
Oh, mama!
-When is the baby due?
-Six months.
If a cow died of natural causes,
I could have one of those, right?
Not if I get there first.
Oh, man!
-What's that?
on the remote.
Do we pay for this?
We didn't even pay our cable bill.
Maybe this is how they punish us.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill.
Free phone sex.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.
Hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
Joey pressed something on the remote
and it just came on.
It happened to me once.
with naked people on it!
But I made the mistake
of turning off the TV.
I never got it back again.
And I'm sad.
Why would he turn off the TV?
The One with the Free Porn
Do we really have to watch this
while we eat?
We don't know
and no one touches the TV.
And no one touches the air
around the TV.
Imagine a protective porn bubble,
if you will.
I'm at least going to mute it.
We still have porn.
What are you doing?
around a stupid massage table.
I need a job with a smaller table.
Or a job without a table.
You mean, like a doctor?
You're blocking the porn!
That reminds me.
I have to see my ob-gyn today.
Emily just went to the airport.
Why didn't you take her?
Her uncle had planned to do it.
We said our goodbyes this morning.
You must feel horrible.
Hey, the guys have free porn.
Hey, cheer up.
Why talk about the future?
-Let's enjoy"
-Don't do the accent. It really bums me out.
Emily said I was pretty good.
Well, that's someone
you should hang on to.
You've got to see her again.
-Why do you care?
and spend your lives together.
Is that why you hung out
with that Ukrainian kid in school?
Yeah, plus his mom used to put
sour cream on everything.
Do you love her?
We said it would only be two weeks.
You love her.
What is love, really?
I knew you loved her!
You go to the airport and tell her.
You'll probably catch her at the gate.
You'll call her name
the most amazing kiss.
Everyone at the gate will applaud.
I am a good kisser.
Then you two can sneak
into the cockpit.
Things will start to heat up.
And then a stewardess comes in....
I've been watching too much porn.
-ls that the heartbeat?
-That's it.
Oh, my God!
This is so cool!
Have we talked about multiple births?
Let's take care of this one. If l
three separate heartbeats.
You guys were worried
I wouldn't even have one.
Doctors are wrong all the time.
Are you sure that there are three?
-Definitely.
-Oh, my God.
So in a few months, I'll have three
when they come shooting out.
Giving birth to three
is like giving birth to one.
What do you know?
-Have you ever had triplets?
-No. I'm sorry, I haven't.
I'm going to use this a lot.
How'd it go at the doctor's?
You know how, when you're
You'll have three babies.
Three babies?
I've finally got my band!
We'll have a big family!
I always wanted a big family.
Oh, God, I'm so glad you're happy!
I was afraid you'd be freaked.
Why would we be freaked?
Because it's harder to raise them
Back to happy!
It's going to be fine...
...because I teach home ec.
I can have  kids making
baby clothes all year long.
It'll be like my very own
little sweatshop.
I was thinking, ever since
drop out of college and get a job.
No, you can't quit college.
You're in college?
Refrigerator college.
When we found out
we were having a baby...
...I figured I should have
a career, you know?
And I love refrigerators.
You can't give up on your dream!
No, it's okay.
for flight .
What are you doing here?
I had to see you
before you took off.
You are so sweet.
That's a big candy bar.
I had the most amazing time with you.
Me too.
This is the final boarding call
for flight .
Well, that's me.
Here, have this.
I'm only allowed
from Good Will Humping.
You know who doesn't like
dirty movies? My boyfriend Joshua.
Yeah, right.
He said he prefers to leave
certain things to the imagination.
Did he also say that
-Yes.
Yeah, he likes porn.
Where you going?
To find out if he really
thinks models are too skinny.
How'd it go?
Frank has to quit college...
...because his super-fertile
sister's having three babies.
I need to make money fast.
about that stuff.
But I can get you free White-Out.
-Did you do what I said?
-I did.
-What'd she say?
-"Thank you."
You're totally welcome.
to get her to do?
-What do I do now?
-You play hard-to-get.
She already lives in London.
So you go to Tokyo.
Forget it.
You told her you love her.
It's over.
It is not over!
and tell you she loves you.
Her feelings were so strong
that it scared her.
Go home and wait for her call.
She could call from the plane.
But if she doesn't call,
to see what's going on...
...and she says she'll call me back,
but then she doesn't.
Then it's over!
Way to be strong!
Can we watch cartoons on your TV?
We need a porn break.
We spent two hours watching
In and Out and In Again.
Why don't you turn it off?
Then we'd be the guys
what you'd go by.
Look, I'm going
to have a kid someday. Okay?
And someday that kid is going to ask me
if I ever turned off free porn.
I don't wanna have to tell him that I did.
Did you ever asked you dad that?
I don't want to talk about it.
Good, you're here!
What you got there?
This? I'm glad you asked.
Don't you hate to cut a tin can
-No.
-Are you sure?
-No.
You won't make enough money
by selling knives.
I just need enough money
-My Saturn dealership.
Hello.
-Ross.
-Emily. Hi.
How was your flight?
It was dreadful.
It was terrible how I acted
when you said those wonderful things.
No, that's all right.
I'm just glad you called.
Ross, there's something
in England as it does in America?
She doesn't know who she wants.
Me or this "Colin" guy.
So I told her when she figures it out,
give me a call. Maybe I'll still be around.
When you say "still around," you mean still
waiting for the phone to ring?
But it was so right.
This isn't how it's supposed to go.
There can't be another guy.
Of course, there's another guy!
This is even more perfect.
You have to prove your love!
I'm not proving anything.
I'm done listening to you.
If I hadn't let you talk me
through the wall.
You did that?
I missed and hit the door.
But it opened really hard.
You have to go to London.
You have to go fight for her.
That makes sense.
You said you loved her,
and she didn't say it back.
Then she told you about another guy.
what did you do?
I made fun of his accent.
You sat back and let him have her.
You didn't fight.
I just told you,
I made fun of him behind his back.
Oh, I see.
-You want that to happen with Emily?
Don't let her go without a fight.
All right. I'm going to do it.
I'm going to London,
and I'll fight for her.
Okay. Good luck!
Can you pick me up one
of those Toblerone bars at the airport?
I did it!
Frank will help me.
We'll work it around his schedule,
so he doesn't have to quit school.
But how can you afford it?
We were walking down the street,
and we saw your van.
-And we realized
and they need massages to relax.
We can combine the two.
I give massages and Frank drives.
I'll bolt a table in the van,
and you know what I've got?
A place that no one
people take when they need to relax.
It's a Relaxi-Taxi!
The name was my favorite part!
-I came up with it.
-You did not!
You came up with Relaxi-Cab.
That's not good.
Oh, my god! Are you in England?
She must be with the other guy.
I'm the stupid moron
who spent the night here.
-What was that?
-I just put my fist through another wall.
Tell the guys.
When is the next flight out?
About four hours.
Stay there for a while.
that would be perfect for you.
Tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.
Ask him if he likes it
better than Relaxi-Cab.
It's not Relaxi-Cab.
It's Relaxi-Cab. Like Taxi-Cab.
That is better.
Do you have any 's?
No.
Are we in London?
Why are you here?
I knew it!
I was right!
I'm right, right?
I'd rather talk to him.
I've been to his apartment
and he's not there.
I need to talk to him.
but I'll talk anyway.
I'm in the States
with your sister and friends.
It's all over with Colin.
I came here to tell you that
and to tell you
Yes, Joey, you can have
that I love you.
I love you too!
I'll call you right now
from the phone booth.
You can't hear me.
I wish I knew if you'd heard me.
I suppose I've given
my neighbors a good laugh.
Mrs. Newman, if you're listening,
you did hear that.
There's the call waiting...
...so I should go.
Oh, well.
Ross, I love you.
Thank you.
I was just at the bank.
There was this really hot teller...
...and she didn't ask me
to do it with her in the vault.
Same thing happened to me.
Pizza delivery girl comes over,
bet the bedrooms are huge"?
Nothing!
You know what?
We have to turn off the porn.
I think you're right.
Ready?
One, two, three.
That's kind of nice.
That's kind of a relief.
You want to see
if we still have it?
-Free porn!
-That's so beautiful.
-Oh, man.
-I can't believe it.
I know.
I like the middle one the best.
Don't worry,
I won't let the other two know.
It is true what they say
Pregnant bellies look like a drum.
I'm so pregnant that
on this drum.
It sounds really cool!
Listen, listen.
Smelly cat, smelly cat
What are they feeding you?
That sounds great!
I know! And I've only
been playing for an hour.
-What are you doing here?
-I came to ask you a big favor.
Don't tell me you want to keep
one of the boy babies...
...Frank Jr., Jr.
Wouldn't that be Frank lll?
Don't get me started.
Anyway, since there
are three babies...
...and we both got
to put our names in...
...we would be truly honored
and be traumatized?
Mommy can have a wife.
Daddy can have a bra.
It's time to go.
See, that clock's a little fast.
We still have  minutes.
What can we do in  minutes...
...twice?
Well, that's ambitious.
You can ignore that.
That's your son.
Believe me, when he's older,
he'll understand.
I'll be right there.
This is Carol and Susan.
-It's so nice to finally meet you.
-I've never been there.
-I'll show you around.
-Great!
Also, I was hoping to catch a show.
Any suggestions?
There's tons of terrific stuff.
I'll go with you.
Look at you two bonding.
Making us late for the airport.
Are you all right?
It's just us getting along
and found nothing.
I want a name that's
really strong and confident.
You know? Like...Exxon!
It certainly worked
for that Valdez kid.
You want a strong name?
but I like a name starting with "The".
You want a good name,
go with Joey.
Joey's your pal, your buddy.
Where is everybody?
They're hanging out with Joey!
If you're going to name him Joey,
and very lovable...
...once you get to know him.
Joey's lovable too.
But with Joey, if you need him,
he'll be there.
Chandler will be there too.
He might be a little late...
...but he'll be there.
is that you're really hot.
What do you say?
I like the idea of naming him
after someone I love.
Joey and Chandler
are both great names.
All right, I don't
Maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
which one would you wear?
It creeps me out choosing
other people's sex clothes.
I'm sorry. I'm just so excited.
I've been waiting for months.
I got my hair colored.
I got new sheets.
with goat cheese and pine nuts...
...wild rice, roasted asparagus
and salmon en croute.
I thought I was making him
filet mignon.
You decided to make salmon
then you would stop cooking...
...and you would have to make your
famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
I really get crabby when I cook.
Why go through all this trouble?
He's a guy.
You'd serve the potato and he'd
just crazy about Susan.
They're going
to the theater together.
They're going to dinner.
They're going horseback riding!
God, Susan is so fun!
Look, this is just
a little too familiar.
For six months
"My friend Susan is so smart.
My friend Susan is so funny.
My friend Susan is so great."
You think something could happen
between Emily and Susan?
Hey, they're going
Didn't you see Personal Best?
No, but I'm gonna!
Hi! You're crazy.
Emily is straight.
How do you know?
We thought Carol was straight.
Yeah, definitely.
I don't like the name Ross.
What a weird way to kick me
happen to The Hulk, you know.
That's not true.
In The Incredible Hulk, number ,
Dr. Bruce Banner found....
You know....
Never mind.
My girlfriend's a lesbian.
I'm definitely going to go
named Chandler.
Raymond Chandler.
Someone you didn't make up.
There are no famous Joeys.
Except for...
...Joey Buttafucco.
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
How about a compromise then?
What if it's...
...Chan-no-ey?
Joey? Think about it.
I've heard in my life!
It's not a name!
It's barely even a word.
It's like chandelier
but it's not!
Then, you put it together with Bing
I have a horrible, horrible name.
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.
So I guess it's Joey then.
This is so nice.
Thank you for doing this.
Please! Cooking soothes me.
So dig in!
It all looks so good.
Oh, my God.
I know.
My God, this rice is so
I am so good!
Behind you.
They used to live here,
that they could not be here?
Farm birds really
kind of freak me out!
Here we go.
There you go!
Hey! How'd you do that?
All gone.
So, farm birds, huh?
It's my only weird thing, I swear.
I would have told you.
I didn't know that they'd be here.
Can I serve you a little
What?
Nothing.
It's just that I know
That's two doors away.
It'll take them a long time
to peck their way back over here.
That's not funny.
Would you feel better
if we went someplace else?
We could pack this stuff up
It's a mess.
I'm staying at my parents' house.
We could go there.
They're out of town.
It's a huge place,
and it's got this gorgeous view.
It'd be very romantic.
-What do you say?
He said no.
I asked if he wanted to sleep.
He said no.
I asked what he wanted to do.
He said no.
So he's sweeping.
Any word from Susan?
She said she's having
ever occur to you that...
...maybe they might be having
a little too much fun?
What's too much fun?
The kind of fun you and Susan had
when we were married.
Oh, my God!
committed relationship.
Carol, so were we.
Just imagine for a moment...
...that Susan meets someone,
and they hit it off.
They're coming back from the theater,
and they stop at a pub for drinks.
They're laughing.
Someone innocently
the slightest possibility...
...of something happening?
-Maybe.
-Oh, my God!
I didn't really believe it
until you just said it!
None of the other kids believed me,
must have been a real babe magnet.
It would have been,
but my parents just moved here.
You should know this place
is a real babe magnet.
Want to make out?
Why don't I put the food
that I could go freshen up?
Just down the hall
and second door to your left.
-Hi, darling.
-What are you doing here?
-We cut the trip short.
but I've got a date here.
Say no more.
We'll grab some food, go upstairs
and be out of your hair.
That'd be great.
So you didn't get to ltaly?
Yep. Sucks!
Hi, you!
Oh, my God!
I know. I can do more than cook.
I like her. She seems smart.
Rachel, my parents.
So nice to meet you.
Joshua, that $ was for groceries.
What, this? Oh, no.
and see how people respond.
Then I report back to my superiors
at Bloomingdale's.
Obviously, in this case...
"U.S.A. not ready."
Maybe in L.A.
There you go!
Have you kids eaten yet?
We were going to do that after.
I mean, next.
Why don't we all
just lying around the house.
So we'll go eat.
You'll wear that.
We'll be eating and,
of course, you'll be wearing that.
I am sorry about what I said.
Nope, you're right.
It is a ridiculous name!
It's not bad.
Yes, it is!
From now on, I have no first name.
You're just Bing?
I have no name.
So what are we supposed to call you?
Okay, for now, temporarily,
to pull off "Clint."
What name am l
cool enough to pull off?
Gene.
It's Clint.
It's Clint!
Bye, Gene.
It's Clint!
What's up with Gene?
You wore your nightie to dinner?
The best part was when the waiter
spilled water down my back.
I jumped up and my boob popped out.
It's all right.
a message from Emily.
She and Susan are going
to a poetry reading together.
-So?
-So?
Poetry?
Susan's gay.
They're being gay together!
Emily's straight.
Oh, wake up!
Carol really messed you up.
Excuse me?
She turned you into
but the rest is right.
What are you talking about?
I am not a crazy, jealous person.
She's right.
When we were together, you got upset
about Mark, and there was nothing.
This makes sense.
It does not!
In high school,
cheated on you.
So up until ', ',
he was very trusting.
Then ' hit, Carol left him,
and bam! Paranoid City!
Absolutely!
This is so fun!
This is not fun!
All we're trying to say is...
...don't let what happened with Carol
about that Mark thing.
Well, you know what?
I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Drumroll.
All right.
Help!
Am I a Mark or a John?
You're not tall enough to be a Mark.
But you might make a good Barney.
Look, I am serious.
to the courthouse.
You're going through with this?
This name has held me back
and why I never do well with women.
So tomorrow, I'll either be
Mark Johnson or John Markson.
You've got problems because of you,
not your name!
This has got to stop!
to name the baby Joey.
I'm going to name the baby Chandler.
Really?
But you have to keep the name too.
Okay, thanks!
You want to hug it out?
I'm going to go tell
Frank and Alice right now!
Bye, Pheebs!
-Nice luggage.
-I was going to say.
I missed you too.
-Thanks, I had a great time.
It's Saturday!
Oh, come on!
Morning's here!
I hate this apartment!
I hate this wall color!
I hate that it still smells like bird!
I hate that singing guy!
Are you kidding? I love that guy!
Morning's here
Stop it!
I will kill you.
I hate that my room is so small.
I have all the space I need.
Do what I did.
You don't even have a bed.
a nice place for us.
I know.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, okay?
It's a great apartment!
Shut up!
This place is a hole!
The One with All the Haste
I still can't believe
Who am l? David Bowie?
He does that?
I don't know. Whatever.
I think it makes you look
really dangerous.
Oh, I know.
You know what?
I never would've gotten this
if it weren't for you.
When I'm with you, I'm like...
...this whole other guy.
A lot.
But that guy!
I love that guy!
I love both of you.
I wish I didn't have to go.
Then don't.
Stay here.
Don't go so soon to London.
Just one more day.
Please don't do this to me again.
I'd stay, but I've already missed
so much work. They'll fire me.
So? Then you could stay
Last time, I left my knickers here.
Yeah, I know.
I tried them on.
You didn't!
No, I didn't.
I didn't want to be "that guy."
Excuse me?
Your pants.
Oh yeah! You like them?
I went to a used-clothes store
a list of baby names. See?
These names are good,
and these are bad.
Hey, Phoebes.
So, how are the elves?
I don't know.
How are the...you know?
Your clothes aren't funny.
What should I wear to a Knicks game?
A T-shirt that says,
the divorce, so she gave them to me.
Apparently, they're good seats.
Oh, my God!
Those are almost on the floor!
I could slip Woody Allen my resume.
Do you guys want these?
Yeah, we do!
Well, you got them!
Just give us our apartment back.
Oh, I didn't see that coming.
Are you serious?
Come on.
We know what these are worth.
Do you think we're stupid?
Not stupid.
bachelor pad for basketball seats.
Your "bachelor pad"?
Have you even had a girl here?
No.
But Joey has, and I usually
talk to them in the morning.
Yeah, you do!
Come on!
Gunther, can I get
two cups of chino, please?
Good one.
Come on.
You know what that means?
I'm not giving up the apartment.
When I was a kid, my dad's company
gave season tickets...
...to the No.  salesman
every year. My dad never won.
Of course, he wasn't in sales.
fun of you already?
Oh, yeah.
Emily convinced me to do it.
You do know that Wham broke up?
I like it. Emily likes it.
That's what counts.
So, how are you guys doing?
Don't try and talk all normal
to her uncle.
Didn't she, like, just get here?
Easy, tiger.
I just hate this so much.
Every time I go pick her up at
the airport, it's so great.
But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back
in a couple of days, dropping her off."
-So what'll you do?
I live here.
She'd have to move here.
She should move here.
What?
-I can ask her to live with me.
-Are you serious?
-I mean, why not?
-You've only known her six weeks!
I've got a carton of milk in my fridge
it's like....
She brings out this great side of me.
I mean, I love her, you know?
And I love the milk!
But I won't ask some British girl
to move in with me.
Joey, you say things now.
Look, Ross. He's right.
Emily's great.
She's great!
But this is too soon.
Don't go too fast.
No. You're right.
I know, you're right.
I'm not going to do it.
-Thanks guys.
-No problem.
Just remember to wake us up
Last chance for the tickets.
Otherwise, I give them to my
new boyfriend, Joshua.
No, thank you.
Wait, wait. Come on, come on!
Let's trade.
The timing's perfect!
in the small apartment...
...after living here!
Ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Ever read Sports Illustrated?
No, I didn't read yours!
We can go to the game tonight!
The only way I'll consider this is...
...if they offer more
than just season seats.
-It's the Knicks!
I just meant that...
...the apartment is worth
so much more.
And the Knicks rule.
Yeah, the Knicks rule!
So? Are you going to do it?
No, we're not going to
because it's not an even trade.
All right, look.
What if you could keep the apartment
Winner takes all.
We could get nothing.
Or everything.
I like that.
What do you say?
Just do it!
Oh! I'm convinced!
Come on, man!
You know I'd do it for you.
Because you're my best friend.
All right. But you can't
use that again for a whole year.
I'm in.
This is so exciting!
who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
I have a game!
-This is great!
-What's the game?
It doesn't have a name.
No, okay. Phoebe Ball!
No, it doesn't have a name.
What is your favorite thing
-Good! Five points!
Same question.
-They're tall.
-Three points!
Both fine answers, but we were
looking for leafy. Leafy.
That's not even a game.
Shut up. We're winning!
You want to finish this?
What do you say?
-Let's do it!
-Oh, I have cards!
Yeah. Here.
No, these are the trick deck.
Here, yes.
Okay, you guys pick first.
-Four.
-That's a low one!
You look.
Jack, queen, king, ace!
No! Ace is low!
Ace, two, three, four!
I don't know.
Look it!
Come on, pick again!
Come on, apartment!
Come on, apartment!
I know queen is high!
Not as high as....
It worked! King!
We pick again!
-I don't know.
Tickets, please.
Courtside, baby!
Seriously, good game, though.
Good game.
What are they so mad about?
They got the apartment back.
No, they didn't.
Packed while you were gone.
I left knickers under your pillow.
Move in with me?
What?
Don't be scared. It sounds crazy,
Think how great it would be.
I don't know.
Leaving London....
My whole family lives there....
-My job.
-You'll get a job here.
I always hear about them foreigners
stealing American jobs.
That could be you.
Yeah, but it's my whole life.
You come to England.
I would. I really would.
You don't think there's any way?
I don't think so.
It would be different if it was
way into the future...
...and we were getting married.
What?
Right. I shouldn't have said "married."
Please don't go freaky on me.
I didn't mean it.
It's better than you moving here.
It's us together forever,
and that's what I want.
-We've known each other six weeks!
-I know.
So what? Who's to say?
four years before we got married...
...and I wound up divorced
from a pregnant lesbian.
I mean, this....
This makes sense for us.
Our first date, we ended up
spending the whole weekend in Vermont.
I mean, last night I got my ear pierced.
Is that "Yes"?
Yes.
-We're getting married!
-Oh, my God!
We're getting married!
Come here, come here.
Emily, will you marry me?
It's a bit small.
Damn! I thought that'd be
romantic as hell.
It was.
Those were, like,
Like a peace offering?
That's very nice.
Plus, they were free and too small.
Oh, God!
Hey, you want a beer?
I know!
Open up! Open up! Open up!
We'll discuss it in the morning.
What the hell is going on?
We took our apartment back!
I had nothing to do with it.
Okay, it was my idea.
But I don't feel good about it.
We are switching back right now.
No, we're not.
You both have jobs.
As soon as you do, we'll switch back!
You can't stop us.
-Right, Joe?
-I don't know.
What?
I don't want to move again, with....
This is our apartment
We won it fair and square. Twice!
And I am getting it back right now!
I'm getting it back right now!
All right.
We figured you might respond
this way, so we have a backup offer.
No more offers.
-As a thank you...
...Rachel and I will kiss
for one minute.
-Totally worth it!
-That was one good minute!
Good night.
-Men are such idiots.
actually got us our apartment back?
If you had just done that
after the last contest...
...no one would have
had to move at all.
Let's pretend that's not true.
Scarf's done.
Come on, come on!
What's going on?
Ross has some big thing
How did you
We just decided to go for it.
We know it's a bit hasty...
...but it just feels so right.
I was just telling the guys
Yeah, I heard.
I think it's great!
I'm so happy for you!
Well, yeah!
Congratulations!
I can't believe
you're getting married!
Monica and Rachel made out.
Morning's here
The morning's here
Sunshine is here
The sky is clear
The morning's here
-Hey, you're back!
All the Wedding Dresses
Gunther, could I get
another cup of coffee?
So what do you do when
you're not working here?
-You don't need to fill these silences.
I've had a certain number of juices.
I'm exhausted because
Joey started snoring.
He's in a different room.
He's that loud?
You should hear me.
It's nothing to be proud of.
You have the problem.
You should go to a "Quit-being-
a-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.
-They don't have those.
-Yeah, they do.
Quit being a baby and leave me alone!
There, you just had your first class.
I used to date a light sleeper.
Whenever I snored,
and I'd stop snoring.
Next time you snore,
I'm rolling you over!
I gotta do what I gotta do.
You gotta do what you gotta do.
Hey, guys.
Oh, the Olympics!
-Have you picked a date?
you're engaged.
Because it's so fast.
Not because you're a loser.
Thanks. Has anyone seen Rach?
She's upstairs not doing the dishes.
I won't do them this time.
Even if they sit there until....
I'll do them when I get home.
Emily found this
-But it didn't fit.
There's a store here with one left in her size.
But the groom can't see
-I'll pick it up for you.
-Thanks.
She's got you running errands,
I was just doing these dishes.
Do you have a minute?
I was just about to
take a break anyway.
So listen...
...I know we haven't had
a chance to talk...
...since Emily and l
how you were.
If you were getting married,
I would feel kind of....
You know?
It definitely took me by surprise.
But, you know...
...I'm okay.
I just wanted to check.
That's sweet. Thank you.
You're great.
And I know someday this will
relationship called "me and Joshua"?
I thought you had
just been on four dates.
I didn't realize that had
become anything.
Oh no, it has become.
Oh no, those were four great dates.
I mean, and the connection!
Emotionally, mentally.
-I know, isn't it?
I'm right there with Joshua.
You are right there with Emily.
And it's kind of like it's a tie.
I gotta get back to my dishes.
I gotta get to work.
You know what would
make me happy?
You know, what's that?
If the four of us could all,
town this weekend.
Why don't we all
have dinner Sunday night?
That would be great!
All right. It's a date!
"Hang in there."
You hang in there.
-Did you say something?
end up getting divorced.
May I help you ladies?
I'm here to pick up a dress on hold.
What's the name?
-Emily Waltham.
-Yes, I have it right here.
Would you like to try it on,
Miss Waltham?
You're the most beautiful bride
Time to roll over.
You are going to a clinic!
You're going to a clinic!
And a pajama store!
Does she use the cups?
Yes, I believe she does.
Does she use the plates?
Yes, I believe she does!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for coming.
-Just a second.
let me in right now!
Are you alone?
All right.
This sucks.
I have to stay up all night
before I go to the stupid clinic.
I'm so tired.
It's six o'clock.
I hear you and Joshua are
going out with Ross and Emily.
I think that's really cool.
I think you're handling
if it wasn't for me and Joshua.
They're not going to
get married anyway.
They rushed into this thing
so fast, it's ridiculous!
They'll be engaged for like what?
what they've done...
...and call it off.
You'll be dancing at my wedding
before you dance at theirs.
You know, I don't dance at weddings.
Why not?
Weddings are a great place
to meet women.
When I dance, I look like this.
Hey, man.
What are you doing
-Nothing.
I am...
...free.
Because we're getting
married in a month.
-What?
-Yes.
In a month?
-You mean  days?
where her parents did...
...but it's getting torn down.
I know it's crazy,
but everything's been so crazy...
...and it just feels right.
Hey, that's the day after
I start menstruating!
This isn't mine.
-Hey, Rachel.
all squeaky on the phone.
Nothing.
I just wanted to see you.
See you and hug you.
See you....
Great!
Sit.
You okay?
I'm more than okay.
I am really, really happy.
Want to know why?
Do l?
Because I am really happy about us.
I think we are so
I think we are clicking.
-You know?
-Yeah, sure, sure.
We're clicking.
If there was just
one little area where...
...I think we need to work on,
just not crazy enough.
I got to say, I'm not too sure
I agree with that.
You know, yeah, you're right.
We have our fun. Yeah?
I mean, like crazy!
You know?
Are you gonna put on
a little hasty.
But just go with me.
What if we got married?
-What?
-Oh, I know. It's so totally like...
..."Whoa, can we do this?"
You know?
But it just feels right.
Don't you...?
Rachel...
...you're...
...a real...
...special lady.
But my divorce isn't final yet...
...and we've been on four dates.
So I'm thinking No...
...but...
...thanks.
You idiot!
-Your name, please?
-Joey Tribbiani.
Did you stay up all night
in preparation for your study?
Sir?
Yes, he did.
All right. We'll call you
She's really hot.
Yeah, she is.
How you doing?
You looking good.
-What?
-You're coming on to the entire room.
-I'm Chandler.
-I'm Marjorie.
-Do you mind if I sit?
I listen in my sleep.
So why don't you give me your number?
Are you ready?
I got it! Mine!
-Congratulations!
-Thank you!
My turn, my turn!
Okay, ready?
That was a terrible throw!
I won't throw it right to you.
That's not real.
Look at me. My big concern
a store called "It's Not Too Late."
-I'm changing out of this.
-Me, too.
In half an hour?
Me, too.
All right, now throw it
straight this time.
I'm getting married!
I hate my regular clothes now.
I look down and I know...
...this won't be the most
fun for a while...
...but didn't you feel kind of silly?
I guess.
Oh, my God!
You're such a cheater!
Hello, little ones.
-So, is Joey going to stop snoring?
-Yep!
And a beautiful woman
agreed to go out with me.
Joey wanted to ask her out,
Joey was unconscious.
Hey, you guys!
What's happening?
Oh, my God!
What is that?
They gave it to me
at the sleep clinic...
...and it's going to help me
wear it unless you are.
I know I don't have to.
It tastes good.
Plus, you look cool.
Hope I didn't stretch Emily's dress.
Your butt's not
that much bigger than her's.
I just called Joshua.
How'd it go?
I did my best to
convince him that I'm not...
...some crazy girl who's
a hard time.
What'd he say?
His answering machine
was very understanding.
I feel blue.
I bet you anything
he'll call you again.
Yeah, maybe. But, you know,
the one I'm sad about.
I know I said I'm totally okay
with Ross getting married.
But as it turns out...
...I don't think I'm handling it
all that well.
Yeah, maybe.
And I'm just trying to
always been on-again, off-again?
I guess I just figured,
somewhere down the road...
...we would be on again.
Again.
You know what?
I think we all did.
I got us reservations
going to be hungry at three.
Three people.
Joshua's not going to be there.
What happened?
Well, I think he broke up with me.
No. Why?
Apparently, he scares easy.
Rachel, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Sometimes things don't work out
the way you thought they would.
Come here.
Don't you have to go pick up Emily?
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. I got my girls.
Hey, you know what might
in a better mood.
I wish there was a job where
I could wear this all the time.
Maybe someday there will be.
Chandler's coming by to borrow
candles for his big date.
Rachel, don't get it!
so much is happening.
I know.
Ross is getting married.
Phoebe's making people.
-Everybody's doing stuff.
-We just sit here.
If I died,
on this chair!
-What are we doing?
-Wasting our lives.
I meant for lunch.
We have to do something.
Something huge!
We could climb Mt. Everest.
Not something stupid.
We could totally do that!
Why not?
I mean, it's just climbing.
-It's just steep!
-Yeah.
We're going! It'd be nice
-Yeah, baby!
I looked into that.
Yeah, but it costs like $,,
and, you know, you could die.
And you would die.
We could get that Everest video.
We could do that
without risking our lives at all.
While we're at the video store,
through mail order.
So you'll stay here
and hang out with me?
But one of these days...
...we'll get off our butts
and rent Die Hard again!
The One with the lnvitation
That was fast. It usually takes me
Do you know what he said?
-Good night, mommy.
-That's because he has lots of mommies.
Yeah, in fact, it's kind of become
his word for "woman".
So does your uncle Nathan
Nobody likes him.
He's so cheap. He'd never fly
to London in a million years.
Invite him!
Did I do these neat enough?
Yeah, they're fine.
We'll say that Ben addressed them.
You invited Rachel then?
Sure, why not?
Really?
I wouldn't be comfortable having
any of my old lovers there.
Do you think
it might be awkward for you.
But it's absolutely your decision.
-More tea?
-Sure.
Earl Grey?
Fine, invite whoever you want.
I don't want to be single, okay?
I just want to be married again.
And I just want a million dollars!
Oh God, Monica. Thank God!
This is Rachel.
-Sure.
Back in high school...
...I had a major crush on you.
I knew.
You did?
I figured you thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.
I did.
Listen, do you think
Try not to let my intense
vulnerability become a factor.
Would it be okay
-I do.
Ross, you're so great.
It's never gonna happen.
I have a question.
Actually, it's not
so much a question.
It's more of a general wondering...
...ment.
Well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to....
Yes, yes.
That's right.
Look!
What?
Top of the world looking
Down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Listen, missy! If you want this cart,
-You were incredible!
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.
I could not have done this
without you.
More clothes in the dryer?
I'm fine.
You had no right to tell me
before I found out.
I was doing great too. It's not
easy for me to see you with Julie.
I don't need this right now.
It's too late.
I'm with somebody else.
This ship has sailed!
All right, fine!
something I care about.
I'm doing something
that I'm actually good at.
If you don't get that
I get that, but I'm tired
of your answering machine.
I don't know what to do.
Neither do l!
Is this about Mark?
Oh, my God!
Okay, it's not.
I can't keep having this
What do you want me to do?
I don't know. Look, maybe
we should just take a break.
You're right. Let's cool off.
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.
A break from us.
-Why are we rushing?
together with me.
I found it!
That's so great for you guys!
-Good luck with your girlfriend.
-Thank you.
-You got my message?
-You are right on time.
Can I be your girlfriend again?
You can very much.
I want you to leave.
-Was she good?
Don't answer!
You wanted to talk about it.
How was she?
She was....
-She was not good, not good.
-Nothing compared to you.
She was different.
Good different?
Nobody likes change.
Just stop!
The way you owned up to everything.
It's just showed me
this would work out.
She was all,
"Once a cheater, always a cheater."
I just wish we hadn't lost
those four months.
But if time was what you needed
We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.
No commitment.
That girl just spent the entire evening
talking to your friends...
...asking to hear stories about you...
...Iooking through
Monica's photo albums.
You don't do that
she has to be at the airport.
And you're sitting here
in a hallway...
...with a -year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.
-You're right.
and in London!
It's so romantic.
Hey, pretty smart!
Tissue paper.
You're at the wedding.
You have to cry.
Handkerchief?
No, I got my invitation.
Isn't this adorable?
Ross let Ben address mine.
Did you get your invitation
We'll show him.
I'm so jealous you're all going.
I never knew you can't fly
in your third trimester.
I didn't, either.
I knew that.
So I didn't know that.
But you should see your faces.
What's up?
Just hanging out.
What's this?
we should have hidden.
No, you guys, come on.
You don't have to do that.
I'm happy for him.
I am. I really
I'll work on it.
I'm sorry.
You're going to come, though,
aren't you?
I don't know.
This isn't one of those
-You're not even invited.
You know what would be real weird?
If you weren't there.
-Just say you'll think about it.
-I'll think about it.
-Who's this from?
We were walking by this antique store.
I saw this and told him
it was like one my grandmother had...
...when I was a little girl.
I can't believe he remembered!
This must've cost a fortune.
I can't believe he did this.
Remember when he fell in love
with Carol...
...and got her
from Beijing now arriving.
Oh, my God!
-We were in school together.
-We haven't seen each other since.
I land in China.
Guess who's in charge of the dig?
Julie!
Isn't that great?
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
that everything's fine.
And I'm really happy for you...
...and your cat.
Obviously, I am over you.
I am over you.
And that, my friend,
is what they call closure.
I got a message from you.
Oh, my God!
Hang up the phone!
Give me the phone!
You're over me?
Oh, God.
You're over me?
When were you...
...under me?
Basically...
...Iately, I've....
I've sort of had feelings for you.
I need to lie down.
He broke up with Julie!
Go hug her, for God's sakes!
-Really?
I had to work tonight.
That's okay.
You're worth the wait.
And I don't just mean tonight.
Oh, God!
Honey.
That's okay.
No, you just rolled over
the juice box.
Did you say anything to Rachel about
me and the girl from the copy place?
I'm sorry.
Was I not supposed to?
You ended it!
Because I was mad at you.
Do you want to get back together?
Maybe.
I don't know.
I just, I feel....
I can't believe I even thought of
getting back together. We're so over!
Fine by me!
And hey! Just so you know,
it's not that common.
It doesn't happen to every guy,
Doesn't she look pretty?
Oh, my God!
This is us getting ready
for the prom.
We don't have to watch this.
Yeah, we do!
Come on!
-Get a shot of Monica.
-How do you zoom out?
There she is!
Shut up!
are actually on you?
Dad, turn it off!
It is off.
Right, Ross?
Looking good, Mr. Kotter!
I can't go to my prom without a date.
It's too late.
If you're not going,
then I don't want to go either.
I have a wonderful idea.
You should take Rachel to the prom.
We've seen enough.
-Fine, I'm not going to watch.
Come on, kid. Let's go.
Are you handsome!
Let's show them!
-Okay, Dad.
-Rachel, ready or not.
Here comes your knight in shining
Oh, dear!
How do I turn this off?
I can't believe you did that.
Yeah, well....
See? He's her lobster!
No.
You're really not going?
It's just going to be too hard.
You know, I mean...
...it's Ross.
How can I watch him get married?
It's just for the best.
You know? It is.
Plus somebody's got
to help her tie her shoes.
Drive her to the hospital
if she goes into labor.
You don't have a car.
And your license expired.
There's so much to do,
and I have so little time!
Check this out.
There's a place you can go
in your underwear.
You could, but just the one time.
We could get videos
of the sights...
...get a VCR in our hotel room
and never have to go outside!
-lf we do that, we've got to rent Die Hard.
I've peed here.
It's also the th time
you've told us.
Sorry, it must be hard to hear.
It's easier having babies playing
"Bring in Da Funk" on your bladder!
I am so sick of being pregnant. God!
I can't sleep, except on my back,
is from a cup of coffee...
...which is decaf
because I'm pregnant!
You want a cookie?
Thank you so much!
So, honey, how are those
mood swings coming?
I haven't had any yet.
The One with the
A thousand times, yes!
Any ideas for the bachelor party?
Before rings and bachelor parties, you have
to decide who your best man will be.
Oh, it's awkward.
I already asked Chandler.
He got to do it
at your first wedding.
I figured you'd understand.
I'll never be a best man.
You can be the best man
when I get married.
I'll never get to be a best man!
Wait, wait.
So you'll be my best man twice,
and I won't be yours at all?
Of course, you can be my best man.
-What about me? You said I could.
for science-fiction writers.
I can't believe it's not me.
-How could it not be me?
-I'm not even
You know what?
That's it.
From now on,
-What?
One of the babies is kicking.
That's a good thing.
It's not kicking me.
It's kicking another baby.
Don't make me come in there!
Do you have a big bowl
I can borrow?
There's one under the cabinet.
-Why do you need it?
-No. Later!
Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!
Hormones.
How come you're having a party
and we're not invited?
-It's Ross' bachelor party.
-So?
Are you bachelors?
Are you strippers?
Then you're not invited.
Then you're not invited
like something I want to do.
I can't believe
I'm going to have a party.
That's so great.
A party!
I don't know why.
This is what I got going
-Great.
In terms of the invite list,
I got you, me and Chandler.
I'll invite Gunther because
we're talking pretty loud.
I'll be there.
I know it's your party...
...but I'd like to limit
Just the dinosaur dudes.
We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Hey, what are you doing?
Just planning my bachelor party
with my best man.
Good luck trying
to top the last one.
It won't be that difficult
I'm too good for the Hut.
I gotta go pick up Ben.
Everything sounds great.
Keep it on the mellow side.
A few guys hanging out.
-No strippers or anything.
say anything about no strippers.
He just said, "No strippers."
I chose not to hear that.
Look what I got, look what I got!
They make these for little people!
Little Village People.
Look at this one.
This is my favorite.
That is so sweet.
Phoebe will love dressing them.
Except she won't be the one
who gets to dress them.
She won't get to keep the babies.
My God, we are throwing
she can use after her pregnancy.
Like regular coffee. Tequila!
-A carton of cigarettes!
-She doesn't smoke.
-It's the thought that counts.
-It's a great idea.
And those leather pants
I can't use for two months?
This sucks!
-Who gave me this?
-Well, l
They told me you like them.
All right, then I'm wrong. It's a great gift.
The best present I ever got!
What's my next present?
We don't have anything.
All right, fine, then this is over.
Balloons!
-Listen, about the stripper....
your next bachelor party?
Joey, I'm kind of hoping
this will be my last one.
A little announcement.
I've decided that my best man
is my best friend Gunther.
What's my last name?
Central Perk?
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.
Hey, Gunther!
Check it out.
Just want everybody to know the
position of my best man is still open.
So is the position of the bride.
Great.
Smooth, man.
You got some chili on your neck.
I just want to say thanks, everyone.
This was great!
See you guys Monday morning.
-Thanks, Joey.
Party's over.
Wave bye-bye to the nice lady.
There you go.
Back to your parents' basement.
All right.
Boys, come on out.
Are those yours?
They let you keep
chickens and ducks as pets?
And I got the duck
totally trained too.
Stare at the wall.
Hardly move.
Be white.
You are good at that.
I had fun tonight.
-You throw one hell of a party.
or have a birthday or a Tuesday....
Yeah, that'd be great.
So, I guess, good night.
Unless you want to hang around.
I'll let you play with my duck.
Stripper!
The stripper stole the ring!
Chandler, get up!
The stripper stole the ring!
-What?
-The ring is gone!
Just give me a minute
You're the worst best man!
This isn't funny.
I go to sleep, everything's cool.
I wake up, the stripper's gone,
and the ring is gone!
-You slept with her?
-Hi, Phoebe.
I wanted to apologize if I seemed
a tad edgy yesterday at my shower.
Just the hormones.
-No, we
-Hormones.
I wanted to say thank you.
-Good.
Everything's been about me lately.
So what's happening with you?
We were just talking about me
not going to Ross' wedding.
It just might be too hard,
when I lived on the street.
This guy offered to buy me food
if I slept with him.
How is this like that?
Well, let's see.
It's not really like that.
Because that was an actual problem.
And yours is just a bunch
and they don't care.
I called  and they yelled at me.
This is an emergency!
I really wanna help you out,
but I got plans to go see Titanic...
...so I've got to call 
What a great party.
The guys from work had a blast.
One of them had never been
to a bachelor party before.
Another one had never been
to a party before.
So that wedding ring.
-Man, that is nice.
babies up for myself.
Where might one get one of those?
When my grandmother first came
to this country...
...that ring and the clothes on her back
were all she had with her.
So you might say
for generations.
Every bride who's worn it
has lived a long and happy life.
So you might say it's a magic ring.
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
What?
-What did you just
-I think I heard what he said.
I believe it was,
"Joey, you be my best man!"
All right.
I'm going to call the cops.
I screwed up.
But you don't have to turn me in.
-Not on you, on the stripper.
after they solve all the murders.
-We'll call the company that sent her.
-I did that too.
They wouldn't give me her real name.
They said if I bother them again,
they'd call the police.
I said, "You talk to the police,
-Look, Ross, I am so sorry.
What if we just called her...
...used a fake name
and had her come to my office?
That sounds like fun,
but we got a ring to find!
Here's your tea, Phoebe.
It's so good.
Thanks.
-Good.
-My God!
I felt one a few minutes ago.
That definitely was one.
You can't have the baby here.
I haven't sterilized the apartment
since the guys moved out!
It's okay. I'll boil some water
and rip up some sheets.
It's probably false labor.
That can happen near the end.
-The book!
-The Bible?
-I don't know!
All right. This is great.
You get behind the desk.
When she comes in,
she won't recognize you because
Well, why would she?
And then you buzz Ross and l.
You be Mr. Gonzales,
My dead grandmother's wedding ring.
Way to be cool, man.
What?
There was a ring in a box.
After you left, it was gone.
You think I stole some ring?
We know you took it!
Just save yourself the time and confess.
Who are you, the Hardy Boys?
I don't need to steal a stupid ring.
She didn't take it.
I didn't take it.
You didn't take it. Then who did?
We're trying to think.
I don't get how you know
it's false labor.
Do you see any babies?
-How do you feel?
to be over soon so....
But isn't that a good thing?
-You said you were sick of this.
-I know.
Usually, when you're done
with the pregnant thing...
...you get to do the mom thing.
But I'll be sitting around in my
now that they're in me...
...it's like I know them and....
It just won't be easy
when these babies have to go away.
I know, sweetie.
But it's not like
you won't have anything.
You'll have nieces and nephews.
-No, really.
You won't be the one
worrying about saving for college.
Or yelling at them when they're bad.
Or putting them on Ritalin
when they just won't calm down.
You'll be the one they run away to.
Are they going to love you!
They are going to love me.
Thanks, you guys. Again.
Oh, sweetie.
Thanks.
What?
Just kidding.
Oh, my God!
Got you again.
You're so easy!
If anything happens to him
The vet said
it's a simple procedure.
Things can go wrong.
-But what if he doesn't?
He's such a good duck.
I'm so worried about him!
Somebody lose a ring?
Oh, my God!
Thank you! Thank you so much!
How's the duck?
Just fine.
You'll see him in a bit.
Great.
-Thanks for being so cool.
and I totally let you down.
-It's not your fault.
-Yeah, it is.
You wouldn't have lost it.
Ross, you were right.
He should be your best man.
-No, you should.
up there with me.
You two are my
I'm lucky to have just one good
Thanks, man.
I got to go check something, okay?
-What a baby!
-Total wuss.
-How come you're getting Nana's ring?
-Mom gave it to me.
She said something about it being
I mean, I've always loved that ring.
Oh, Mon, I'm sorry.
I'd let you have it,
but Emily's gotten really attached to it.
Thanks.
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
Emily, did you know that that ring spent

The flight leaves in four hours!
There could be traffic!
The plane could leave early!
ln London, there could be
a line at customs! Come on!
Six-hour trip to London.
Traveler's checks, check.
-Who are you saying ''check'' to?
-Myself.
For remembering to pack a thing.
You do a good thing,
you get a ''check.''
Mom does it.

Actually, only the one time.
But it's pretty weird.
Are you ready yet?
-Got the tickets?
-Right here. Check!
lt's all London, baby!
Here we go.
Got your passport?
Third drawer of my dresser.
on the left side.
Garbage bags are next
to the refrigerator.
Rachel's gonna be here.
Can't l just ask her?
Yeah, okay. Give that a try!
-Let's do it.
l was wrong.
We're all here.
Let's get going!
l want to go over and hug you...
...and wish you luck,
but l can't get up.
-l'll come hug you.
-Thanks.
Chandler, l want to hug you too!
You might as well bring my book
from your apartment.
-So we're off.
-Have fun!
-l can't believe you won't be there.
lt would mean so much to me.
l gotta work. l'm sorry.
Why can't you take
a couple of days off?
Because l can't.
l told you.
This is my wedding.
Now we are late.
on video when we get back.
Here you go, Phoebe!
Phoe-bo! Phoo-ba-la!
You!
Let's go!
Bye, Pheebs!
London, baby!
Oh, God!
Do you need a hug?
You don't have to bring me anything.
Chandler, do something!
-Do something!
-l am. l'm ignoring you.
l'll be the on-camera guy.
All right. First stop...
...Westminster Abbey.
What is that?
That's London, baby!
All right, the hotel's here.
Wait.
We want to go--
l know.
l'm gonna have to go into the map.
lf you see a little version
the entire time, are we?
Man, you made me lose it!
That was all before  .
The caterer rang. lt'll be Chicken
Kiev, not Tarragon.
Then the florist said
there are no tulips.
And the cellist has
-Oh, that's not what it means.
-No! That's ''time out.''
-Sorry.
Sweetie, relax.
Everything will be great, okay?
Come on, come on.
Chicken Kiev?
Doesn't that sound delicious
more elegant than chicken.
And you wouldn't worry
about the salmonella.
But of course...
...with salmon you would have
to worry about the chicknella.
l can't wait to see
Her parents got married here.
l can't believe
they're tearing it down.
lt's really the most lovely building.
lt's over--
Oh, my God!
lt's nice.
Oh, my God!
What are we going to do?
Everything's gonna be all right.
How's it gonna be all right?
l see that.
l talked to a guy,
of changing the name.
-To what?
-To ''Put the Camera Away'' !
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
Don't worry, you'll find
some place to get married.
Sorry. Lucky this dress is red.
We can't find another place.
Then we can't have the wedding.
l've ordered chicken, and salad,
of my life...
...is rapidly turning into just Sunday
with a spectacular amount of food.
You're gonna find a place.
But even if, God forbid, you didn't,
so you postpone the wedding.
ls that really so bad?
Think about it. You could take all the time
You could have salmon.
Salmon.
l suppose it wouldn't be
the end of the world.
Oh, thank you.
Look, either way you're gonna get married.
You're gonna be happy.
My mom's gonna like you better than me.
Oh, God. She has told you
-Nothing.
Come on. l'm here
to take care of you.
Okay, l have a wedgie.
That is all you.
What do you want for lunch?
l don't know.
l guess we have to eat.
Yeah, l do.
What's the matter?
l'm bummed the way
l left things with Ross.
l wish l didn't lie about work.
lf l was still in love with some--
Still in love with?
l'm not in love with Ross.
Good!
Yeah, me neither.
l'm not at the wedding,
because he's my ex-boyfriend...
...and that would be uncomfortable.
Not because l'm in love with him.
l like Ross as much as anyone.
Clearly, l have feelings for him,
loving feelings for Ross? Yeah!
l have continuing feelings of love.
But that doesn't mean
l'm still in love with him.
l have sexual feelings for him,
but l do love him.
Oh, my God!
Why didn't you tell me?
-We thought you knew!
We talk about it all the time.
You all know?
Does Ross know?
No! Ross doesn't know anything.
And you didn't tell me!
We thought you knew.
lt's so obvious!
lt would be like telling Monica
''Hey, you like things clean.''
Or, you know, ''Hey, Joey, you're gay.''
What?
Oh, please, she's always got
Scarves, souvenir postcards....
Check this out!
That's the stuff!
What do you think?
l won't need that
''l'm with stupid'' T-shirt anymore.
Well, l like it. Here you go.
You're not really buying that.
l'm pretending l don't know you?
He's just jealous.
All Londoners wear them.
Really? Then how come no one here
anywhere is wearing one?
They're all tourists.
lf you insist on wearing that
all by yourself.
lf you make me choose between
you and the hat, l choose the hat.
-Good choice.
-Thanks.
That's it! l'm out of here.
and you know what?
He thinks we can find a new hall.
-We don't have to.
-You found a place?
No, but Monica and l were talking...
...and l was so upset about the hall
being knocked down...
...and she suggested we put
we'd find in a day...
...we should postpone it.
Postpone it.
Do you think Monica realizes
how much our parents spent on this?
Do you think my sister's teeny,
tiny, little brain comprehends...
...that people took time
to be here?
This isn't right.
l realize that people
are gonna be disappointed.
But l'm sure they'll come back.
l can't ask people to do that.
Would you?
Don't you point your pants at me!
We have no choice.
Anywhere half-decent
This is our wedding!
Postponing it is not an option.
This is when we're getting married.
-You're saying it's now or never?
-l'm saying it's now.
-Or?
lt's you who's backwards.
lf you don't understand
how important this is to me...
...perhaps we shouldn't marry at all!
Emily, no! Wait, stop!
Emily, please--
Did shopping help you
photos of Ross...
...and a small piece of chocolate...
...and a glass of tepid water.
ls this where you throw stuff...
...in a bag with graveyard dirt
and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Only if you have the hiccups too.
The chocolate and water are for me.
l didn't feel like getting up.
l'll show you a picture of Ross.
And you remember all
-l can do that.
l did that
while we were going out.
Before we start, l want to say,
for the record, l love Ross.
He's such a great guy.
Close your eyes.
lmagine that you're with Ross.
lmagine that you're kissing him.
You're running your hands
through his hair but--
Gross!
lt's some kind of grease.
l don't know.
His hair never bothered me that much.
lt was more crunchy
than it was greasy.
This will be harder than l thought.
Let's try some aversion therapy.
Look at the picture.
How do you feel now?
Well, l like you less.
Sorry.
l'm sorry. l shouldn't have said
l've had a really lousy day.
Me too.
-Yeah?
-No!
l had the best day ever!
Dude, check this out!
<i>Tell my friend you like my hat.</i>
-<i>What's your friend's name?</i>
-That's--
<i>but I think it's kind of dashing.</i>
<iSo I hear you're single now.</i
-<i>Yeah, I don't like the hat that much.</i>
-<i>Okay.</i>
When did you--?
How?
l was trying to get
a talk with Emily.
Yes, l did.
And you are welcome.
Am l?
Was it your idea
to postpone the wedding?
-l'm going to the bathroom.
-Wait up!
Since you're the fix-it lady,
she doesn't want the wedding at all?
She said that?
Why?
l don't know. l said it was stupid
to put off the wedding...
...and she, like, flipped out.
Oh, my God!
this wedding?
l don't know. A month?
Emily's probably been planning it
since she was .
Ever since the first time she hung
a pillowcase from her head.
That's what we did.
We dreamed about the perfect wedding.
ln the perfect place.
With the perfect
all that stuff was.
l had no idea.
That pillowcase thing, l thought
you were doing <iThe Flying Nun.</i
Sometimes we were.
Come on.
Help me figure out what to do.
Pretty intense, huh?
l hope Ross didn't think we left
because we were uncomfortable here.
l hope he did.
l thought of a good flaw.
-l know, it drives me crazy.
l'll get it.
Pheebs, it's Joey.
Hey, Joey!
l saw someone that looks just
like you on the subway.
l was going to say hi, then l figured
he doesn't care he looks like you.
That just cost me  bucks.
l called to see how the chick
Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful.
So do you miss me?
Kind of, but l've been
having too much fun.
You're not homesick yet?
l don't think so.
Well, the seven of us miss you.
-Who's seven?
-Me, Rachel...
...the birds, the babies.
The babies miss me?
Of course they do, or l'm just really hungry.
Pizza guy's here!
You ordered pizza without me?
But we were thinking about you.
-<iWait!</i
Where did you get it from?
<i>And they're always glad you came</i>
<iYou want to be where you can see</i
<i>Your troubles are all the same</i>
<i>You want to be</i>
<iWhere everybody knows your name</i
Why have you brought me here?
You'll see.
This wedding won't happen.
Ross.
But imagine a lot more lights...
...and fewer bricks...
...and flowers and candles.
And the musicians can go over here.
The chairs can face this way and--
You go.
But if you don't love this,
we'll do it any other place or time.
Really, it's fine.
Whatever you want.
lt's perfect.
And, l don't know, if it rains--
Then we'll get wet.
l don't even have a date.
Do you remember
under the sink. Why?
Because l'm going to London.
What? What do you mean?
l have to tell Ross l love him.
Take care and don't have
the babies till l get back.
But what about all
the finding-his-flaws stuff we've been doing?
Yeah, that didn't work.
You can't go.
to tell him how l feel.
He deserves all the information
to make an informed decision.
You're going
because you hope he'll say:
''l love you too.
with the British chippy!
You're just gonna mess with his head
and ruin his wedding.
lt's too late!
You missed your chance.
l'm sorry.
until someone says, ''l do.''
l do! l do!
Like l can really chase you.
l'm carrying a litter!
The Waltham residence.
ls this Emily's parents' house?
<i>This is the housekeeper speaking.</i>
And, by the way, that is not how one
addresses a person on the telephone.
...and then asks for the person
-<iHello.</i
This is Phoebe Buffay.
l was wondering, please...
...if it's not
too much trouble, please...
...might l speak with
at the rehearsal dinner.
And it is not polite
to make fun of people. Goodbye.
l'll be nice, l swear. Could you just
give me the number for where they are?
l'm afraid l'm not at liberty
the wedding, and l have to warn somebody.
So if you don't give me that number,
l'm gonna come over there...
...and l'm gonna kick your snooty ass
all the way to New Gloukenshire!
Hello? Hello?
She knew l could kick her ass.
-Hi, sweetheart.
l insisted on riding the tube.
Judy, the kids!
Jack, that's what they call the subway.
-l thought--
-Dad, we got it.
Here comes my dad and stepmom.
Mr. and Mrs. Geller.
-This is Steven...
-Hello, darling.
...and Andrea Waltham.
Very nice to meet you.
Darling, the Gellers.
Darling, it's the Gellers.
She's very self-involved.
-Where?
That's one and that's another one.
Lovely to meet you.
Nice of you to offer to pay
for half the wedding.
The hell with tradition.
We're happy to do it.
We know how expensive
the only wedding we get to throw.
A joke that's funny in all countries.
Sir?
-What's in it?
-Goat cheese, watercress and pancetta.
That's not food.
Everything's different here.
l want to go home.
l miss my family, the coffeehouse.
l can't even remember
and just enjoy yourself?
You're different here too.
You're mean in England!
What the hell?
What's up, Dad?
This bill for my half of the wedding.
lt's insane.
How can it be so much?
The reception's at their house.
Flowers, liquor.

Please.
l don't want anything
to upset Emily tonight.
She's had a hard enough
couple of days as it is.
Here.

Sometimes l forget
how powerful you can be.
And l'm gonna go get drunk.
-Hello.
-Hello.
When is your next
on this ticket is $.
Huh. How about ?
-Sorry.
-How about  and these earrings?
They prefer it if l don't barter.
l don't think l have enough left
on my credit card.
You can split it with another card.
How about five?
Thank you.
l'm just going to need
exactly where it is on my nightstand.
You know what?
l have my driver's license.
And l have a .
Face it. My father is not going to pay
for the built-in barbecue.
And believe me, you can
to get you the new lawn.
Then you have to give us
the lawn ornaments.
l go back there with lawn ornaments,
he'll laugh in my face.
This is ridiculous.
you don't want to talk about it.
You're doing the right thing.
Where are you going?
What are you doing? No, wait.
Why am l always pregnant
when she does that?
l'd like to make a toast
to Ross and Emily.
My big toast is tomorrow.
This is kind of my little toast,
when he was with his first girlfriend.
l thought things were going to work out
for him, until the day he over-inflated her.
Oh, dear God!
Hello, Waltham lnteriors.
Mrs. Waltham.
l need to speak with one of the best men
or Ross' sister, Monica.
-Who is this?
She's a bitch, but l wore her down.
lf you're one of Ross' best friends,
why aren't you here?
l can't fly.
l'm having my brother's babies.
Am l on the radio?
Can l talk to one of them?
l'm going to cut you off.
Oh, okay, l'm going
to have to kick her ass too.
We're excited that Ross and Emily are
getting married at Montgomery Hall.
To think, my friend getting
Come on, you people!
All right, forget it.
Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
Best man number two, Joey Tribbiani.
l'm not good with the jokes
like Chandler here.
Congratulations to the happy couple.
l first met Ross
to know you better.
l'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
l was laughing.
Out loud?
l didn't want everyone
to think l was stupid.
So how are you?
My mother's driving me crazy.
But Ross is getting married. l'm happy.
l'm not going to let anything spoil that.
l just want to say that
a teenager when you had him.
There's no way in hell
l'm paying for it.
Look, we're down to just one point.
Could we please just settle it
after the wedding?
Fine, but l'm not paying
German-if-it-weren't-for-us, cheap little man!
The guy was hammered. There's
no way you look like Ross' mother.
-Then why would he say it?
-Because he's crazy!
He came up to me earlier and thanked me
l'll never get married.
You know what, that is--
Who wouldn't want you?
Please! l'm a single mom
with a -year-old son.
-Hi, l'm back. Listen, l need to--
-Hello.
Hello. l need to get on that   : flight.
l'm afraid that plane's already
tell them to swing around and pick me up.
-Can't do that.
-Sure, you know what?
We'll just tell them that there was, like,
a problem with, like, the engine.
l'm afraid l'm going to have
he is gonna marry that other girl.
Can't imagine why.
All right. You know what?
l am not leaving here until
you call that plane back.
l'm getting married today!
Morning.
-l'm getting married today!
-Yeah, you are.
Do you think he knew l was here?
-Excuse me.
throughout the flight, tell me now...
...so that l can take a sedative.
Or perhaps slip you one.
l'm sorry. l'm very sorry. Sorry.
lt's just, l'm kind of excited.
l'm going to London...
...to tell this guy that l love him.
Well, l've never done that with you before.
So how are you?
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah. You?
Oh, yes. Yes.
You?
We did you.
Well....
-l better get going.
-Absolutely.
Could you not look?
l don't want to look.
Where the hell have you been?
l spent the night out.
l met this cute bridesmaid. She is so--
l don't want to hear it!
Pheebs, you know you're still
Rachel's coming to London.
Great!
No, it's not great. She's coming
to tell Ross that she loves him.
But he loves Emily.
l know that!
You have to stop her.
She's going to ruin the wedding.
Okay.
-All right, so--
The burden is off me.
-Right?
-Right.
So tell me about this girl.
And so then l realized,
all the stuff that l had been doing...
...proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about
-Oh, oh, oh, oh!
l'm sorry, can l interrupt?
l just want to say that you are
a horrible, horrible person.
Pardon me?
You say you love this man, and yet you're
about to ruin the happiest day of his life.
l'm afraid l have to agree
-But why?
He loves this Emily person.
No good can come of this.
-Well, l think you're wrong.
-Oh, no.
Well, he doesn't really love her.
-Fortunately l won't.
And by the way, it seems to be
perfectly clear that you were on a break.
Do something.
Something.
-Have you seen Monica?
-l'm not seeing Monica!
-What?
to tell Ross she loves him.
-Oh, my God!
-l know. Do you know where Monica is?
No. What's with the third degree?
Why not just shine a light in my eyes?
Oh, my God!
lt's like a fairyland.
l know. lt's horrible, isn't it?
l love it. l only hope
-You can let some of them go by.
Start looking out for Rachel.
l'll cover the front door.
You watch that big hole.
And l got Chandler covering Ross.
Why would l care where Chandler is?
You know...
...sometimes l don't even
like Chandler.
Okay.
l do.
l do.
l do.
-You're right. lt's the second one.
We're not paying for your wine cellar.
You have to meet me in the middle here.
My foot's gonna meet
the middle of your ass.
-What's going on?
-Everything's under control.
You want a piece of me, sir?
Back away!
This is our wedding day!
From now on, everyone gets along.
And if l hear one more word...
...no grandchildren!
That's right!
-Okay, okay.
-Sorry, old boy.
l could kill you
before the wedding. lt's bad luck.
l think we've had all the bad luck
we're going to have.
My God, Rachel!
You're here.
l can't believe it.
What happened?
This is going to be the last time.
There's a girl on the phone for you.
Great!
<i>It's Phoebe.</i>
Did you stop Rachel?
No, but it's okay. She just came in
and gave him a hug. That's it.
-Nothing got ruined?
That's so great!
So, what's going on now?
l'm walking down the aisle.
Still walking.
