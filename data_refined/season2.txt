{}{}What happened?

{}{}Enough about me,|Mr. Back From The Orient!
{}{}Come on, I wanna hear everything!|Everything!
{}{}Well, where do I start?
{}{}These are...
{}{}These are...
{}{}...aren't for you.
{}{}Welcome to our country.
{}{}Thank you. I'm from New York.
{}{}No problem. We'll use them|to stop the bleeding.

{}{}Guys, you got new haircuts!

{}{}Quick, get the verbs.
{}{}You! You!
{}{}You said he liked me!
{}{}You slowpokes!
{}{}That's all right.|We got the bags.
{}{}This is my sister, Monica.
{}{}Phoebe, hi.
{}{}Joey.
{}{}Everyone, this is Julie.
{}{}But I'm not here,|you haven't met me.
{}{}I'll make a better impression when|I don't have  hours of plane on me.
{}{}- And bus.|- Oh, my God!
{}{}You gotta hear this story.
{}{}We're on this bus|that's  years old.
{}{}Two hundred, at least.
{}{}I'm so sorry.
{}{}I just gave away the ending, didn't I?
{}{}I just heard this story in the cab...
{}{}This is amazing.
{}{}How did this happen?
{}{}We were in grad school together.
{}{}...guess who's in charge of the dig?
{}{}Julie!
{}{}Isn't that great?
{}{}It's an expression.
{}{}We just wanted to say a quick hi.

{}{}Then, no.
{}{}What the hell happened to you in China?
{}{}When last we left you,|you were in love with, you know.
{}{}But there was always this voice|inside that kept saying
{}{}"It's never gonna happen. Move on."|You know whose voice that was?
{}{}God?
{}{}Maybe it was God doing me.
{}{}You were right. She looks at me|and sees a friend. That's all.
{}{}And then I met Julie...
{}{}I never would have gone for it,|if it hadn't been for you.
{}{}Well, you owe me one, big guy.
{}{}Your lemonade.
{}{}Then go take that back.|They'll charge you for that.
{}{}Go, go, go! Come on, come on!
{}{}So what did you find out?
{}{}He said...
{}{}They're having a great time.
{}{}I'm sorry.
{}{}...is that he made this decision|all by himself...
{}{}...without any outside help whatsoever.
{}{}How is that a silver lining?
{}{}Ironically, these guys|were picked last in gym.
{}{}Hey, Pheebs.
{}{}You know what I'm thinking?
{}{}...it's been so long|since you've had sex...
{}{}...you're wondering|if they've changed it?
{}{}No. Although now|that's what I'm thinking.
{}{}You gave the guys great haircuts.|I thought you'd like to do mine.
{}{}No.
{}{}Why not?
{}{}I'm incredibly anal and|an unbelievable control freak.
{}{}No, you're not.
{}{}I know I'm not, but you are.
{}{}Hold on.
{}{}Ross, Julie for you.
{}{}Anybody know a good tailor?
{}{}No, I'm just looking for a man|to draw on me with chalk.
{}{}Go see Frankie. My family's|been going to him forever.
{}{}He did my first suit when I was .
{}{}No, excuse me, .
{}{}All right, when was ?
{}{}You have to stop the Q-Tip|when there's resistance!
{}{}Okay, bye.
{}{}That is so sweet.

{}{}Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.|We got disconnected.
{}{}No, you hang up.
{}{}How did this happen to me?
{}{}Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.
{}{}Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...
{}{}...this really great guy|that I can't have.
{}{}I know you did.
{}{}I'm just gonna deal with it.
{}{}I gotta get out of here!
{}{}You know, I think I was .
{}{}Please, just a little bit off the back.
{}{}I'm still on "no".
{}{}Could you close your eyes for a sec?
{}{}No, no, no. I'm not|falling for that again.
{}{}What's going on?
{}{}What stupid thing did you do?
{}{}Why don't you just go get dressed...
{}{}...then you'll be on your way.|Bye-bye.
{}{}I kind of ran into him last night.
{}{}- Where?|- At his apartment.
{}{}Is this juice?
{}{}Oh, God, I know.|I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.
{}{}Honey, you're not pathetic.|You're just sad.
{}{}People do stupid things|when they're upset.
{}{}But this is about your horrible mistake.
{}{}Sorry we're late.
{}{}We were...
{}{}Hey, Ross!
{}{}What a...
{}{}What are you doing here?
{}{}So he's back?
{}{}Yeah, he's back.|Is that a problem?
{}{}No, not a problem.
{}{}You're gonna have to not touch my ass.
{}{}Despite the yummy bagels|and palpable tension...
{}{}...my pants need to be altered.
{}{}He'll know what it means.
{}{}You sure he'll crack that code?
{}{}It's funny. The last time Paolo|was here, my hair was so much cuter.
{}{}But you have to promise that you|will not be all controlly and bossy...
{}{}...and all Monica about it.
{}{}I promise.
{}{}Now, some of you are gonna get cut|and some of you aren't.
{}{}But I promise, none of you|will feel a thing.
{}{}- That's it. I quit.|- What? I didn't say anything!
{}{}This is the face of|a person who, you know...
{}{}...doesn't trust a person.
{}{}I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
{}{}Would you relax?|I know what I am doing.
{}{}This is how he wears it.
{}{}How who wears it?
{}{}Demi Moore is not a "he".
{}{}Well, he was a "he"|in "Arthur" and in "".
{}{}That's Dudley Moore!
{}{}Oh, my God!
{}{}Oh, God!
{}{}Oh, my God! I'm sorry!
{}{}She's the actress that was in|{yi}Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
{}{}She's got gorgeous hair.
{}{}I know!
{}{}At least as long as I have the pants.
{}{}I just got that.
{}{}Now we'll do your inseam.
{}{}It's too soon to tell.
{}{}She's resting, which is a good sign.
{}{}How's the hair?
{}{}I put a clip on one side, which seems|to have stopped the curling.
{}{}Can we see her?
{}{}Your hair looks too good.|It'd upset her.
{}{}Well, how you doing?
{}{}I'm okay.
{}{}That bad, huh?
{}{}It's one of my gifts.
{}{}Joey, when I saw him|get off that plane with her...
{}{}...I really thought|I just hit rock bottom.
{}{}... feet of crap...
{}{}...then me.
{}{}Tell Ross how you feel.
{}{}What about her? They've only|been going out for two weeks.
{}{}Ross has been in love|with you for  years.
{}{}I don't know. I don't know.
{}{}I've been with a lot|of people's share of women.
{}{}But the point is...
{}{}...I've never felt about anyone|the way Ross felt about you.
{}{}Yo, paisan!
{}{}Can I talk to you for a sec?
{}{}Your tailor...
{}{}What are you talking about?
{}{}Hey, what's going on?
{}{}Joey's tailor...
{}{}No way! I've been going|to the guy for  years.
{}{}He said he was gonna do my inseam.
{}{}Then he ran his hand up my leg|and then there was definite...
{}{}Cupping.
{}{}That's how they do pants!
{}{}First they go up one side,|they move it over.
{}{}Ross, tell him. Isn't that|how a tailor measures pants?
{}{}Yes, yes, it is.|In prison!
{}{}What's the matter with you?
{}{}That's not?
{}{}Oh, my God!
{}{}Even Mary Tyler Moore|would've been better.
{}{}I do. I think it's a !
{}{}Thank you.
{}{}My hair is very amused.
{}{}You could "get caught between|the moon and New York City.
{}{}I know it's crazy, but it's true."
{}{}Thank you.
{}{}Bye, Rach!
{}{}Wait, are you leaving?
{}{}That's what I meant by "bye".
{}{}When the doctor does|that hernia test...
{}{}That's okay.
{}{}What's going on?
{}{}...Paolo and I are not back together.
{}{}That was a stupid thing I did.
{}{}If I could go back in time|and do it again...
{}{}Second of all...
{}{}What?
{}{}Is this one of those things|where you break up with a guy...
{}{}...and the next day|you get back together with him...
{}{}...and I look like|a complete idiot?
{}{}Well, then, I think the guy's scum.
{}{}I always have.
{}{}And you are way too good|to be with a guy like that.
{}{}Really?
{}{}...and who gets how funny...
{}{}...and sweet and amazing...
{}{}...and adorable and sexy you are.
{}{}"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!"
{}{}You know? Someone|who makes you feel good.
{}{}Like the way I do with Julie.
{}{}No, I think that was the whole "all".
{}{}I gotta go.
{}{}Thanks.
{}{}That's not how they measure pants!
{}{}I was thinking of doing it shorter,|like Andie MacDowell's haircut.
{}{}- Yeah, I could do that.|- Really?
{}{}See you.
{}{}I just wanna make|really sure this time.
{}{}Andie MacDowell is the girl from|"Four Weddings and a Funeral", right?
{}{}That's Roddy McDowall.
{}{}Andie MacDowell is the guy|from "Planet of the Apes".
{}{}- Thank you.|- You're welcome.
Ross was in love
with Rachel since forever.
Every time he tried to tell her,
like, "Forget about her."
When Ross was in China, Chandler
let it slip that Ross loved Rachel.
She was, like, "Oh, my God!"
So she went to the airport to meet him.
She didn't know Ross was getting
off the plane with another woman.
That's pretty much everything
How have you been?
This is pretty much
what's happened so far.
Flight number 
from Beijing now arriving.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Excuse me.
Move, move, move!
- I am?
Oh, look at that! Yes, I am.
Enough about me,
Mr. Back From The Orient!
Come on, I wanna hear everything!
Everything!
Well, where do I start?
This is Julie.
to stop the bleeding.
Baggage claim?
I'm telling U. She went to the airport,
and she's gonna go for it with Ross.
Oh, my God! This is huge!
This is bigger than huge.
This is...
All right, what's bigger than huge?
This?
Guys, you got new haircuts!
Yes, we did.
look good, we don't look good."
I love that voice!
And the winner is Eva Godna!
Airport. Airport. Ross.
Not alone.
Julie.
Arm around her!
Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!
I think she's trying
to tell us something.
Quick, get the verbs.
You! You!
You said he liked me!
You!
You slowpokes!
That's all right.
We got the bags.
This is my sister, Monica.
This is Chandler.
Phoebe, hi.
Joey.
Everyone, this is Julie.
Julie.
But I'm not here,
I don't have  hours of plane on me.
- And bus.
- Oh, my God!
- With the screaming guy
- And the spitting.
You gotta hear this story.
We're on this bus
I land in China...
...guess who's in charge of the dig?
Julie!
Isn't that great?
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
It's an expression.
We just wanted to say a quick hi.
- Then we'll see the baby.
- Then get some sleep.
It's : tomorrow night, our time.
Don't tell us what's gonna happen.
- Sure.
- Did you talk to him yet?
- No.
Then, no.
What the hell happened to you in China?
When last we left you,
you were in love with, you know.
I know I was.
But there was always this voice
You know whose voice that was?
God?
It was you, pal.
Maybe it was God doing me.
You were right. She looks at me
and sees a friend. That's all.
And then I met Julie...
...and we're having a great time.
I never would have gone for it,
if it hadn't been for you.
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Your lemonade.
I didn't order it.
Then go take that back.
if you wanna see it...
...is that he made this decision
all by himself...
...without any outside help whatsoever.
How is that a silver lining?
You have to really wanna see it.
Ironically, these guys
were picked last in gym.
Hey, Pheebs.
You know what I'm thinking?
How...
...it's been so long
if they've changed it?
No. Although now
that's what I'm thinking.
So what were you thinking?
You gave the guys great haircuts.
I thought you'd like to do mine.
No.
Why not?
Because I'm just...
I'm incredibly anal and
to draw on me with chalk.
Go see Frankie. My family's
been going to him forever.
He did my first suit when I was .
No, wait, .
No, excuse me, .
All right, when was ?
You have to stop the Q-Tip
when there's resistance!
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.
Okay, bye.
That is so sweet.
Okay. No, you hang up.
No, you
One, two, three.
You didn't hang up either.
She didn't hang up.
No, you hang up.
You. You.
Sorry, I thought
We got disconnected.
No, you hang up.
How did this happen to me?
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...
...this really great guy
that I can't have.
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
I know you did.
I'm just gonna deal with it.
I gotta get out of here!
I don't care what you guys say,
something's bothering her.
You know, I think I was .
Please, just a little bit off the back.
I'm still on "no."
Morning.
Could you close your eyes for a sec?
No, no, no. I'm not
thing last night.
What stupid thing did you do?
Why don't you just go get dressed...
...then you'll be on your way.
Bye-bye.
How did this happen?
I kind of ran into him last night.
- Where?
- At his apartment.
Is this juice?
And the fact that you dumped him
I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.
Honey, you're not pathetic.
You're just sad.
People do stupid things
when they're upset.
My God, if I had a nickel
your horrible mistake.
Sorry we're late.
We were...
Well, there was touching.
Hey, Ross!
What a...
What are you doing here?
I do Raquel!
So he's back?
Yeah, he's back.
Is that a problem?
No, not a problem.
Good. Glad it's not a problem.
You're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Despite the yummy bagels
and palpable tension...
...my pants need to be altered.
When you see Frankie,
was here, my hair was so much cuter.
All right.
But you have to promise that you
will not be all controlly and bossy...
...and all Monica about it.
I promise.
All right, let's see.
Now, some of you are gonna get cut
and some of you aren't.
But I promise, none of you
- What? I didn't say anything!
But this isn't the face of
a person who trusts a person.
This is the face of
a person who, you know...
...doesn't trust a person.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just a little shorter
I know what I am doing.
This is how he wears it.
How who wears it?
Demi Moore.
Demi Moore is not a "he."
Well, he was a "he"
in Arthur and in .
That's Dudley Moore!
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!
Which one is Demi Moore?
She's the actress that was in
Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
She's got gorgeous hair.
I know!
How long do you want the cuffs?
At least as long as I have the pants.
I just got that.
Now we'll do your inseam.
How is she?
It's too soon to tell.
She's resting, which is a good sign.
How's the hair?
I'm not gonna lie to you.
to have stopped the curling.
Can we see her?
Your hair looks too good.
It'd upset her.
Ross, you come on in.
Well, how you doing?
I'm okay.
That bad, huh?
Look, I can sense when women
are depressed and vulnerable.
It's one of my gifts.
Joey, when I saw him
I just hit rock bottom.
But today, it's like
there's rock bottom...
... feet of crap...
...then me.
Tell Ross how you feel.
Come on, how can I just tell him?
What about Julie?
What about her? They've only
with you for  years.
I don't know. I don't know.
I've been with my share of women.
I've been with a lot
of people's share of women.
But the point is...
...I've never felt about anyone
the way Ross felt about you.
Really?
Yo, paisan!
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Your tailor...
...is a very bad man!
What are you talking about?
Hey, what's going on?
Joey's tailor...
...took advantage of me.
No way! I've been going
and then there was definite
What?
Cupping.
That's how they do pants!
First they go up one side,
they move it over.
Then they go up the other side,
move it back, then they do the rear.
Ross, tell him. Isn't that
In prison!
What's the matter with you?
What?
That's not?
Oh, my God!
Even Mary Tyler Moore
would've been better.
I like it.
I do. I think it's a !
Thank you.
My hair is very amused.
Come on, things could be worse.
You could "get caught between
the moon and New York City.
I know it's crazy, but it's true."
Thank you.
Well, I gotta go. Bye.
Bye, Rach!
Wait, are you leaving?
That's what I meant by "bye."
Can I talk to you for a sec?
When the doctor does
and do it again...
...well, I wouldn't.
Second of all...
What?
Is this one of those things
where you break up with a guy...
...I tell you what I think...
...and the next day
you get back together with him...
...and I look like
I physically hate him.
I always have.
And you are way too good
to be with a guy like that.
Really?
You deserve to be with someone
who appreciates you...
...and who gets how funny...
...and sweet and amazing...
...and adorable and sexy you are.
You know? Someone who wakes up
who makes you feel good.
Like the way I do with Julie.
Was there a "second of all"?
No, I think that was the whole "all."
I gotta go.
Thanks.
No, I swear to God, Dad!
That's not how they measure pants!
I was thinking of doing it shorter,
like Andie MacDowell's haircut.
- Yeah, I could do that.
- Really?
- You wanna do it now?
really sure this time.
Andie MacDowell is the girl from
Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
No.
That's Roddy McDowall.
Andie MacDowell is the guy
from Planet of the Apes.
- Thank you.

{}{}My breast milk is gross?
{}{}This should be fun.
{}{}I just don't think|breast milk is for adults.
{}{}Of course, the packaging does|appeal to grownups and kids.
{}{}Don't be silly. I've tried it.|It's no big deal.
{}{}That would be no.
{}{}- Come on.|- Try it.
{}{}It's natural.
{}{}Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet.|Sort of like...
{}{}Like what?
{}{}Cantaloupe juice.
{}{}You've tasted it.
{}{}You've tasted it.
{}{}Oh, you've tasted it.
{}{}Give me the bottle.
{}{}Get me the towel.
{}{}Howdy.
{}{}Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
{}{}Maybe it's because of|the way you're dressed.
{}{}Or this guy's doing so good|they want to put more people on it.
{}{}What do you care?
{}{}You're an actor.|This is your day job. It's nothing!
{}{}I know, but I was the best.
{}{}Maybe I should get|out of the game.
{}{}They need guys up in housewares|to serve cheese.
{}{}Say you do that.
{}{}Then where you gonna run?
{}{}You're right.
{}{}I say you show him what you're made of.|Stand your ground.
{}{}- I'm gonna do it!|- All right!
{}{}Now, go see Miss Kitty and|she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
{}{}I don't know what to say.
{}{}I feel terrible. I really do.
{}{}I'm sorry.|Did my back hurt your knife?
{}{}Say that I'm friends with her.|Is that so terrible?
{}{}It's bad enough|she stole the guy...
{}{}...who may be the person|I'm supposed to be with.
{}{}But now...
{}{}But now she's actually stealing you!
{}{}What are you talking about?
{}{}Nobody could steal me from you.
{}{}You're my...
{}{}And we're...
{}{}- Oh, I love you!|- I love you too!
{}{}But I love you guys too!
{}{}I really needed that.
{}{}I know that right now...
{}{}But she didn't do anything wrong.
{}{}She's just a girl who met a guy,|and now they go out.
{}{}I think that if you gave her|a chance, you'd like her.
{}{}For me?
{}{}I'd do anything for you,|you know that.
{}{}I'd do anything for you!
{}{}Mornin'.
{}{}I said, mornin'!
{}{}I heard you.
{}{}You boys ready?
{}{}Ready.
{}{}Yeah, I'm ready.
{}{}You've blinded me! I'm suing!
{}{}Oh, my God! Todd!|What the hell did you do?
{}{}Sorry. I'm such a doofus!
{}{}My God, what happened?
{}{}These new kids, they never last.
{}{}Sooner or later they all...
{}{}What do you say I buy you|that cup of coffee now?
{}{}Sure.
{}{}I just thought we should hang out.
{}{}I guess you'd know that,|being one of the two of us.
{}{}I know.
{}{}I probably shouldn't|even tell you this...
{}{}Really?
{}{}Me?
{}{}Oh, my God, are you kidding?
{}{}...and I really wanted you|to like me, and I...
{}{}It's probably me just|being totally paranoid...
{}{}...but I kind of got the feeling|that maybe you don't.
{}{}When you and Ross|first started going out...
{}{}...it was really hard for me...
{}{}...for many reasons of which|I'm not gonna bore you with now.
{}{}And Monica's always|saying how nice you are...
{}{}...and God, I hate it when she's right!
{}{}Thanks.
{}{}Yeah, that'd be great.|I'd love it.
{}{}I'd love it too.
{}{}Shoot, I gotta go.
{}{}What a manipulative bitch.
{}{}It's not bad.
These were unbelievely expensive
and he'll grow out of them...
...in  minutes,
but I couldn't resist!
Look at these.
Hey, Ben.
"Just do it"!
Oh, my God!
Was that too much
- I guess so.
You know, it's...
Something funny about sneakers.
I'll be right back.
I gotta get one too.
Hey, what are you guys doing?
We're just hanging out
by the spoons.
Ladle?
Will you guys grow up?
This is the most nature beautiful
But there's a baby sucking on it.
This is my son having lunch, okay?
It'll happen a lot, so get used to it.
If you're uncomfortable,
just ask questions.
Carol's fine with it.
Carol?
I'm wondering, could Joey ask you
does the other one get bigger?
The One With the Breast Milk
- Any muffins left?
- Yeah, I forget which ones.
You're busy, I'll get it.
- Anyone else want one?
- No, thanks.
You're losing your apron.
- Thank you.
What a bitch!
I have a friend at
Bloomingdale's who's quitting...
...and he wants to abuse his discount.
Anyone want to come
take advantage of it?
I have to take
- Great.
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, sweetums.
And hello to the rest.
You can't go shopping with her.
What about Rachel?
Will it be a problem?
You're going to
in her house of worship.
Monica, she will kill you.
She will kill you
like a dog in the street!
So Jules tells me you guys
are going shopping tomorrow.
It's actually not that big a deal.
It's a big deal to me.
- Hey, Joey.
Did you hear about the new guy?
Nobody knows his name. Me and
the girls call him "The Hombre Man."
Hombre?
What's he doing in my section?
I guess he doesn't know.
Well, he's gonna.
I'll see you a little later, okay?
Hey, how you doing?
Mornin'.
Listen, I know you're new...
...but it's understood
that everything...
...from young men's to
- No, thanks.
Hombre?
Yeah, all right.
You were saying?
Phoebe, listen. You were with me,
and we were shopping all day.
We shopped and we had lunch.
What did I have?
- You had a salad.
- No wonder I don't feel full.
Hi. What's up?
I went shopping with Monica
What'd you buy?
We went shopping for...
For...
For fur.
You went shopping for fur?
And then I realized
that I'm against that.
So then we bought some...
Boobs.
You bought boobs?
Bras!
We bought bras!
We bought bras.
Bijan for men?
Bijan for men?
Bijan for...
Hey, Annabel.
I was wondering if after work
we could grab a cup of coffee?
Actually, I sort of have plans.
You ready, Annabel?
You bet.
Maybe some other time.
It's not the first time I lost a girl
not before, or he won't sleep.
We've been through this before.
We have a good time.
We laugh, we play.
It's like we're father and son.
Honey, relax.
I'm a lovely person.
This is so cute!
I got that for him!
"My Mommies Love Me."
That's clever.
Oh, hi, Jul...
Hi, Jew!
Okay, sure.
That'd be great.
See you then. Bye.
Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"?
Yes, I did.
That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.
Yeah, he likes it.
Reaffirms his faith.
Ben, dinner!
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.
Did you microwave that?
how to heat breast milk.
What did you just do?
I licked my arm, what?
It's breast milk!
So?
Phoebe, that is juice
squeezed from a person.
What is the big deal?
What did you just do?
Can people stop
drinking the breast milk?
You won't even taste it?
Not even if you just
a picture of a missing child on it.
- Where is everybody?
- At the park. Where have you been?
Just out.
Had some lunch. Just me.
A little quality time with me.
- Thanks for your jacket.
how come it cost you $?
You know what probably happened?
Someone stole my credit card.
And put the receipt
back in your pocket?
That is an excellent,
excellent question.
That is excellent.
What's with you?
- Who?
- Julie.
- What?
Jody.
You were with Julie?
When it started, I was just
trying to be nice to her...
...because she was
led to another...
...and before I knew it, we were...
...shopping.
Oh, my God!
Wait, we only did it once.
It didn't meant anything to me!
Rachal, I was thinking
of you the whole time.
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
I never meant for you to find out.
Oh, please! Please!
to leave it in here?
Did it ever occur to you
that I might just be that stupid?
Okay, I just have to know one thing.
Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
Okay, I just really need
to not be with you right now.
Hi, who's this?
Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?
as simple as all that.
No, I don't care what Steve thinks.
Hi, Steve.
How did we do?
I tasted Ben's milk
and Ross freaked out.
I did not freak out.
- Why'd you freak out?
breast milk is for adults.
Of course, the packaging does
appeal to grownups and kids.
Don't be silly. I've tried it.
It's no big deal.
Just taste it.
That would be no.
- Come on.
Sort of like...
Like what?
Cantaloupe juice.
Exactly.
You've tasted it.
You've tasted it.
Oh, you've tasted it.
You can keep saying it,
but it won't stop being true.
Give me the bottle.
Get me the towel.
Howdy.
Give me a box of juice.
Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Maybe it's because of
the way you're dressed.
Or this guy's doing so good
two bottles a day now.
What do you care?
You're an actor.
This is your day job. It's nothing!
I know, but I was the best.
You know? I liked being the best.
Maybe I should get
out of the game.
They need guys up in housewares
along that slices a better cheddar.
Then where you gonna run?
You're right.
I say you show him what you're made of.
Stand your ground.
Show him that you're the baddest
Hombre west of the lingerie!
- I'm gonna do it!
she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
I don't know what to say.
That's good because I'm not listening.
I feel terrible. I really do.
I'm sorry.
Did my back hurt your knife?
Say that I'm friends with her.
Is that so terrible?
- It's that terrible?
she stole the guy...
...who may be the person
I'm supposed to be with.
But now...
...she's actually...
But now she's actually stealing you!
What are you talking about?
Nobody could steal me from you.
Because I'm friends with her doesn't
make me any less friends with you.
You're my...
And we're...
- Oh, I love you!
doesn't have anything to do with me.
But I love you guys too!
I really needed that.
I know that right now...
...you really need
to hate Julie's guts.
But she didn't do anything wrong.
She's just a girl who met a guy,
and now they go out.
I think that if you gave her
you know that.
I'd do anything for you!
Wait, wait, wait!
Mornin'.
I said, mornin'!
I heard you.
All right, everybody.
I'm opening the doors.
You boys ready?
Ready.
Yeah, I'm ready.
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!
You've blinded me! I'm suing!
Oh, my God! Todd!
What the hell did you do?
Sorry. I'm such a doofus!
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
My God, what happened?
These new kids, they never last.
Sooner or later they all...
...stop lasting.
What do you say I buy you
we've never really talked.
I guess you'd know that,
being one of the two of us.
I know.
I probably shouldn't
even tell you this...
...but I'm pretty much
to like me, and I...
It's probably me just
being totally paranoid...
...but I kind of got the feeling
that maybe you don't.
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
When you and Ross
I'm not gonna bore you with now.
I see how happy he is
and how good you guys are together.
And Monica's always
saying how nice you are...
...and God, I hate it when she's right!
Thanks.
Would you like to go to
I'd love it.
I'd love it too.
Shoot, I gotta go.
- So I'll talk to you later.
- All right, Julie.
What a manipulative bitch.
It's not bad.

{}{}So how was Joan?
{}{}Broke up with her.
{}{}Oh, why?
{}{}They were huge!
{}{}When she sneezed,|bats flew out of them.
{}{}They were not that huge.
{}{}How many women will you reject...
{}{}...over superficial,|insignificant things...
{}{}Hold it. I gotta side|with Chandler on this one.
{}{}Really hot. Great kisser...
{}{}...but she had the biggest|Adam's apple.
{}{}Drove me nuts.
{}{}Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
{}{}You guys are messing with me, right?
{}{}Yeah. We are!
{}{}The One Where Heckles Dies
{}{}English Subtitles by|GELULA & CO., INC.
{}{}You name one woman that you broke up|with for an actual real reason.
{}{}Because she doesn't hate Yanni|is not a real reason.
{}{}Hello, Mr. Heckles.
{}{}You're doing it again.
{}{}You're stomping.|It's disturbing my birds.
{}{}You don't have birds.
{}{}I could have birds.
{}{}Thank you.
{}{}I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
{}{}All right, bye-bye.
{}{}Give me Janice.|That wasn't about being picky.
{}{}We'll give you Janice.
{}{}I miss Janice, though.
{}{}Oh, my God!
{}{}Oh, Chandler!
{}{}Now! Now!
{}{}There! Faster!
{}{}Stop with the broom!|We're not making noise!
{}{}We won.
{}{}Mr. Heckles!
{}{}- How did this happen?|- He was sweeping.
{}{}They found a broom in his hand.
{}{}I was sweeping yesterday.
{}{}It could've been me.
{}{}Sweeping. You never know.
{}{}It's very faint, but I can|still sense him in the building.
{}{}Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
{}{}Okay, Phoebe.
{}{}Here we go.
{}{}That's fine, go ahead and scoff.
{}{}There are a lot of things|I don't believe in...
{}{}Such as?
{}{}Like crop circles or|the Bermuda Triangle or evolution.
{}{}What, you don't believe in evolution?
{}{}You don't believe in evolution?
{}{}I don't know.|It's just, you know...
{}{}Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story.|I just think it's a little too easy.
{}{}The process of every living thing|on this planet evolving...
{}{}...over millions of years from|single-celled organisms is "too easy"?
{}{}Yeah, I just don't buy it.
{}{}Evolution is scientific fact,|like the air we breathe...
{}{}...like gravity.
{}{}Don't get me started on gravity.
{}{}Well, it's not so much that,|you know, I don't believe in it.
{}{}Lately I get the feeling that...
{}{}...I'm not so much being pulled down|as I am being pushed.
{}{}It's Isaac Newton and he's pissed.
{}{}There she is. And over there,|that's the other one.
{}{}This is Mr. Buddy Doyle,|Heckles' attorney.
{}{}What can we do for you?
{}{}All right, kids, here's the deal.
{}{}According my client's will...

{}{}What about his family?
{}{}He didn't have any.
{}{}All right, there was none.

{}{}Isn't it amazing how much|you can touch someone's life...
{}{}...without even knowing it?
{}{}Would you look at this dump?
{}{}I've never seen so much crap!
{}{}Actually, I think this apartment|sullies the good name of crap.
{}{}Check this out.
{}{}How can you not believe in evolution?
{}{}I don't know, just don't.|Look at this funky shirt!
{}{}Pheebs, I've studied evolution|my entire adult life.
{}{}...that actually show the evolution|of different species.
{}{}I mean, you can literally see them...
{}{}...evolving through time.

{}{}I think we have enough regular lamps.
{}{}...I'm asking for this|girlie clock or anything.
{}{}Which, by the way,|I also think is really cool.
{}{}Look, it doesn't go|with any of my stuff.
{}{}You don't have any stuff.
{}{}You still think of it|as your apartment, don't you?
{}{}Yes, you do.
{}{}While you "mmm" on that,|I'll go find a place for my new lamp.
{}{}Okay, Pheebs. See how I'm making|these little toys move?
{}{}Opposable thumbs!
{}{}Maybe the Overlords needed them|to steer their spacecrafts.
{}{}Tell me you're joking.
{}{}Look, can't we say that you believe|in something and I don't?
{}{}What is this obsessive need|to make everybody agree with you?
{}{}No, what's that all about?|You know what I think?
{}{}I think maybe it's time|you put Ross under the microscope.
{}{}Check it out.|Heckles' high-school yearbook.
{}{}He looks so normal!
{}{}He's even kind of cute.
{}{}"You're the funniest kid in school."
{}{}- Funniest? Heckles?|- That's what it says.
{}{}Heckles was voted class clown,|and so was I.
{}{}I'd call that excessive.
{}{}What?
{}{}Heckles played clarinet in band,|and I played clarinet.
{}{}There was no club,|but I sure thought they were cool.
{}{}So? You were both dorks.
{}{}Big deal.
{}{}Heckles and me. Me...
{}{}Me and Heckles.
{}{}Hey, would you knock it off!
{}{}Look at this.
{}{}Pictures of all the women|Heckles went out with.
{}{}Look what he wrote on them.|"Vivian, too tall."
{}{}"Too loud."
{}{}"Too smart."|"Makes noise when she eats."
{}{}This is me.

{}{}I don't know. I'm just|trying to help you out.

{}{}Yes, I am.

{}{}Sweetie, I'm sorry.
{}{}You couldn't tell me on the phone?

{}{}You know what we haven't|played in a while?

{}{}Then you'll just have|to eat the other lamps.
{}{}It's scary scientist man.
{}{}In this briefcase I carry|actual scientific facts.
{}{}A briefcase of facts, if you will.
{}{}Some of these fossils are|over  million years old.
{}{}It's just one of the possibilities.
{}{}It's the only possibility.
{}{}Ross, could you just open|your mind, like, this much?
{}{}And up till  years ago, you thought|the atom was the smallest thing...
{}{}...until you split it open|and this whole mess of crap came out.
{}{}Are you telling me that you are|so unbelievably arrogant...
{}{}...that you could be wrong about this?
{}{}There might be...

{}{}How are you going to face|the other science guys?
{}{}That was fun.|So who's hungry?
{}{}I am.
{}{}Me too.|Let me just get my coat.

{}{}Why is that?
{}{}You know, a hook.

{}{}Then I'll get more snakes,|call them my babies.
{}{}Kids will run past my place!
{}{}"Run away from Crazy Snake Man",|they'll shout!
{}{}You won't end up alone.
{}{}Of course I will.
{}{}I reject anyone who's crazy enough|to actually go out with me...
{}{}You have just described...
{}{}...virtually every man|that we've ever gone out with.
{}{}You are not a freak.|You're a guy.
{}{}You're no different than the rest.
{}{}Wait a minute, wait a minute.|Yes, he is.
{}{}You are totally different.
{}{}No, honey, in a wonderful way.
{}{}You know what you want now.

{}{}Gosh, this is so weird.

{}{}They let me be the guy who fixes|the copier but can't...
{}{}...because there's people|having sex on it.
{}{}That is wild!
{}{}What happens if you flick it?
{}{}So does it do anything,|you know, special?
{}{}Pressing my third nipple|opens the delivery entrance...
{}{}In some cultures, having a third nipple|is actually a sign of virility.
{}{}You get the best huts,|and women dance naked around you.
{}{}Are any of these cultures,|per chance, in the Tri-State area?
{}{}Julie's so smart!|Julie's so special!
{}{}I wanted you to hook up|with Ross as much as you did.
{}{}But he's with her now.|You'll have to get over it.
{}{}I didn't know that's what I had to do.|I just have to get over it.
{}{}- Sassy lady!|- Where are you going?
{}{}I'm meeting Duncan.|He's skating tonight at the Garden.
{}{}- The Ice Capades?|- No, the Gravel Capades.
{}{}The turns aren't as fast,|but when Snoopy falls? Funny.
{}{}I can't believe|you'd dress up for him.
{}{}Okay, no.
{}{}For your information, I'm seeing him|so I can put those feelings behind me.
{}{}The reason I'm dressed like this|is because I think it's nice...
{}{}Darn it, we're all out of milk.
{}{}Chandler, will you fill me up here?
{}{}I see, I see. Because of|the third-nipple thing.
{}{}- See you later, Rach.|- Bye-bye, Julie.
{}{}Come on, cut it out!
{}{}- Can I ask you something?|- Sure.
{}{}Come on, talk to me.
{}{}What's the longest you've been|in a relationship before...
{}{}...having the sex?
{}{}Are you and Julie not having sex?
{}{}Technically?
{}{}No.
{}{}Or because she's kind of bossy,|makes it feel like school?
{}{}No! She's great. And it's not|like we haven't done anything.
{}{}We do plenty of other stuff.|Lots of other stuff like...
{}{}No, it's just...
{}{}It's me.
{}{}I've only been with|one woman my whole life...
{}{}So now I've got myself|all psyched out.
{}{}It's become, like, this...
{}{}...this thing!
{}{}No, I don't think it's weird.
{}{}I think, in fact...
{}{}- In fact, you know what I think?|- What?
{}{}Sexy?
{}{}Let me tell you something.|As a woman...
{}{}...there is nothing sexier...
{}{}No kidding?
{}{}You know what I'd do?
{}{}I'd wait.
{}{}...and wait...
{}{}Then I'd wait some more.
{}{}Really?
{}{}...she tells you she's gonna|have sex with another man...
{}{}That just means it's working.
{}{}Women really want this?
{}{}Look at you! You look great!
{}{}Do I? Thank you.
{}{}So do you. Sparkly!
{}{}I remember when you were just|King Friday in Mr. Roger's "Ice Is Nice".
{}{}You always said I'd make it.
{}{}Well, you know,|I'm kind of spooky that way.
{}{}- I'm gonna get changed.|- Okay.
{}{}Now.
{}{}Oh! Right. Okay.
{}{}What?
{}{}The Matador...
{}{}{y:i}Olé!
{}{}Sorry, you had a|paleontologist on your face.
{}{}But it's gone now.|You're all right.
{}{}Hi, everyone.
{}{}No problem! So you're gonna|go with the waiting thing?
{}{}I was going to, but after|I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
{}{}Good. What did he say?
{}{}I thought about what you said|and about what he said.
{}{}And his way, I get|to have sex tonight, so...
{}{}What is this in my pocket?
{}{}Pop it in!
{}{}I'm fine, if you're|okay watching a video...
{}{}...filled with two-nippled people.
{}{}What's wrong with people having sex?
{}{}Well, you know, these|movies are offensive...
{}{}...and degrading|to women and females...
{}{}- Monica, help me out here.|- Hell, I wanna see Joey!
{}{}So is there a story?|Or do they just start doing it right...
{}{}Oh. Never mind.
{}{}All I say is, she'd|better get the job.
{}{}Looks to me like he's|the one getting the job.
{}{}Here I come.
{}{}I can't get to the copier.|I'm thinking, "What do I do?"
{}{}So I just watch them have sex.
{}{}Then I say... Here's my line!
{}{}Nice work, my friend!
{}{}Wait, you see me again. Hang on,|the guy's butt's blocking me.
{}{}There I am. There I am.|There I am...
{}{}I kind of need a divorce.
{}{}O...
{}{}...kay.
{}{}Actually, I'm getting married again.
{}{}What?
{}{}I don't know how to tell you this.
{}{}I don't understand.|How can you be straight?
{}{}You're so smart and funny...
{}{}...and you throw|such great Academy Award parties!
{}{}But you reach a point|where you can't live a lie anymore.
{}{}How long have you known?
{}{}I guess on some level|I always knew I was straight.
{}{}I'm an ice dancer, all my friends|are gay. I was just trying to fit in.
{}{}And there's actually a woman?
{}{}Her name's Debra.
{}{}I've never told you this...
{}{}...but there were one|or two times back in college when...
{}{}...I'd get drunk,|go to a straight bar...
{}{}I told myself it was the liquor,|and everyone experiments in college.
{}{}Sure.
{}{}Now I know I don't have a choice.|I was born this way!
{}{}You're married to someone for|six years and you think you know him.
{}{}And then one day he says,|"Oh, I'm not gay!"
{}{}I'm still me.
{}{}You know, it still|smells like monkey in there.
{}{}That saves us the conversation.
{}{}This has been great,|but I'm officially wiped.
{}{}No! Come on, you guys!
{}{}Let's just talk. We never just|hang out and talk anymore.
{}{}Maybe that's all we do.|What about Julie?
{}{}What about Julie?
{}{}You have been in our lives|for nearly two months now...
{}{}I mean, who is Julie?
{}{}What do you like?|What don't you like?
{}{}We want to know everything.
{}{}So?
{}{}Who here does not have|the time to get to know Julie?
{}{}I got the time to get to know Julie.
{}{}That's fine.
{}{}Let's start with your childhood.|What was that like?
{}{}In a nutshell...
{}{}No, but it'll be okay.|They're pretty cool.
{}{}My brother's straight, so...
{}{}Here you go.
{}{}If you had figured this out sooner,|and I had been around...
{}{}...do you think I|would have been the one...?
{}{}No. Don't tell me.
{}{}I love you, Phoebe.
{}{}So your brother's straight, huh?
{}{}Seriously.
{}{}...and my first-grade teacher|was Mrs. Cobb.
{}{}Mrs. Gobb?
{}{}No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.
{}{}I'm going home.
{}{}Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?
{}{}Good night.
{}{}No, I am.
{}{}Are you nervous?
{}{}I have done it before.
{}{}Are you gonna talk about it beforehand?|Are you just gonna pounce?
{}{}I don't know. I guess|I'm just gonna...
{}{}...see what happens.
{}{}What?
{}{}Nothing...
{}{}It is your first time with her,|and if the first time doesn't go well...
{}{}Okay, now I'm nervous.
{}{}Maybe you should put it off.
{}{}No, I don't want to put it off!
{}{}And now I'm actually happy.
{}{}You know, I mean really happy.
{}{}I just don't wanna...
{}{}I know.
{}{}I'm sorry.
{}{}It's not your fault.
{}{}Maybe it doesn't|have to be this tough.
{}{}Maybe you were on the right track|with that whole "spontaneous" thing.
{}{}- Women really like that.|- Really?
{}{}I don't know, catch me off guard|with a really...
{}{}...good kiss.
{}{}Really sort of soft at first.
{}{}And then look far into my eyes...
{}{}...in a way that lets me|know something...
{}{}...amazing is about to happen.
{}{}...you'd pull me|really close to you so that...
{}{}...so that I'd be pressed up|right against you.
{}{}And it would get kind of...
{}{}...and blurry.
{}{}And then it's just happening.
{}{}Thanks, Rach. Good night!
{}{}Good morning!
{}{}Well, somebody got some last night!
{}{}Twice!
{}{}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! D
{}{}Man, I sure miss Julie.
{}{}Spanish midgets.
{}{}Julie!|Okay, I see how you got there.
{}{}You ever figure out|what that thing's for?
{}{}I'm trying this screening thing.
{}{}My God!|Rodrigo never gets pinned!
{}{}{y:i}Hello. I'm looking for Bob.
{}{}{yi}I don't know if you're still|{yi}at this number, but I was thinking...
{}{}{yi}... but I was hoping|{yi}we could hook up again.
{}{}{yi}...so you know what I did?|- What?
{}{}{y:i}... and naked.
{}{}The One With Five Steaks and An Eggplant
{}{}English Subtitles by|GELULA & CO., INC.
{}{}So what have you been up to?
{}{}{yi}Teaching aerobics...
{}{}{yi}And in case you wondered...
{}{}Can you hold on?|I have another call.
{}{}- I love her!|- I know.
{}{}- I'm back.|{y:i}- So are we gonna get together?
{}{}How about tomorrow afternoon?
{}{}Do you know Central Perk?|Say, five-ish?
{}{}{y:i}Great. I'll see you then.
{}{}You do a good Bob impression...
{}{}...but when she|sees you tomorrow...
{}{}...she's gonna realize|you're not Bob.
{}{}...she'll seek comfort in the arms of|the stranger at the next table.
{}{}Oh, my God.|You are pure evil.
{}{}Okay, pure evil...
{}{}I've done this.
{}{}Yeah, everybody's here.
{}{}Hey, everybody!|Say hi to Julie in New Mexico!
{}{}While Ross is on the phone...
{}{}...everybody owes me| bucks for his birthday.
{}{}Is there any chance that|you're rounding up from...
{}{}...from like ?
{}{}Hey, we got the gift,|the concert and the cake.
{}{}Do we need a cake?
{}{}But it's Ross.
{}{}It's Ross.
{}{}See you later.|I gotta go...
{}{}Okay, sweetheart,|I'll call you later.
{}{}You're not going|through with this, are you?
{}{}You know, I think I might just.
{}{}Well, I gotta start|saving up for Ross' birthday.
{}{}I guess I'll just stay home|and eat dust bunnies.
{}{}Can you believe|how much this costs?
{}{}...Chandler and those guys...
{}{}...don't get that|we don't make that much money?
{}{}They always say|let's go here, let's go there.
{}{}Yes, and we always have to go to,|you know, someplace nice.
{}{}And we can't say anything about it,|because this is a birthday thing...
{}{}...and it's "for Ross".
{}{}Oh, my God!
{}{}I'm at work...
{}{}...just an ordinary day,|chop, chop, sauté, sauté.
{}{}They fired the lunch chef,|and guess who got the job?
{}{}If it's not you,|this is a horrible story.
{}{}Fortunately, it is me.
{}{}That's so cool!
{}{}Anyway, I think we|should go out and celebrate.
{}{}You know, someplace nice.
{}{}How much you think|I can get for my kidney?
{}{}You can't do this.
{}{}I can't get a girl like that|with conventional methods.
{}{}She wanted to call Bob. Bob could be|who she was meant to be with.
{}{}You may be destroying|their chance for happiness.
{}{}We don't know Bob.
{}{}Go over there|and tell that woman the truth.
{}{}All right.
{}{}Go.
{}{}I have to confess something.
{}{}Yes?
{}{}Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
{}{}I just had this weird sense.|But that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.
{}{}Tissue?
{}{}Thanks.
{}{}I'm all cried out today.
{}{}Here is to my sister,|the newly appointed head lunch chef.
{}{}Also in charge of purchasing.
{}{}Who has her own little desk|when Roland's not there.
{}{}Lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk|when Roland's not there...
{}{}...here's to my...|- Wait! And I got a beeper!
{}{}Sorry.
{}{}Monica!
{}{}Are we ready to order?
{}{}When you do, let me know.
{}{}I'll be over there|on the edge of my seat.
{}{}Look at these prices!
{}{}I know! What are these,|famous chickens?
{}{}Sorry I'm late.|Congratulations, Mon.
{}{}I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible|was my afternoon with Jade?
{}{}Why is this woman leaving a message|for you on my machine?
{}{}I told her that|my number was yours...
{}{}...because I couldn't|tell her it was mine...
{}{}Tell me again.|What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
{}{}Do I dare ask?
{}{}I'll start with the carpaccio,|and then the grilled prawns.
{}{}And for the gentleman?
{}{}I'll have the Thai chicken pizza.
{}{}But if I get it without|the nuts and leeks and stuff...
{}{}You'd think, wouldn't you?
{}{}I will have the side salad.
{}{}And what would that|be on the side of?
{}{}Just put it right here|next to my water.
{}{}And for you?
{}{}I'm gonna have a cup|of the cucumber soup and...
{}{}I will have the Cajun catfish.
{}{}Anything else?
{}{}Yes, how about a verse of|{y:i}Killing Me Softly?
{}{}Plus tip, divided by six...
{}{}Everyone owes  bucks.
{}{}Everyone?
{}{}Thank you.
{}{}It's Monica's big night.|She shouldn't pay.
{}{}So five of us is...
{}{}No. No way.|Sorry, not gonna happen.
{}{}Prom night flashback.
{}{}Sorry, Monica.|I'm happy you got promoted...
{}{}No!
{}{}Rachel just had that little salad...
{}{}...and Joey with his teeny pizza!
{}{}How about we'll each|pay for what we had?
{}{}It's no big deal.
{}{}Not for you.
{}{}I don't wanna get|into this right now.
{}{}It'll make everybody uncomfortable.
{}{}You can tell us.
{}{}We three...
{}{}...feel like that...
{}{}...sometimes you guys don't get that...
{}{}I hear you.
{}{}We can talk about that.
{}{}Well, then...
{}{}I guess I just never think|of money as an issue.
{}{}- Because you have it.|- Good point!
{}{}So how come you guys|haven't talked about this before?
{}{}...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.
{}{}I don't want my birthday to be|the source of any kind of negative...
{}{}There's gonna be a hoopla?
{}{}If it makes anybody feel better,|forget the thing...
{}{}...and we'll just do the gift.
{}{}Gift? The thing's not the gift?
{}{}Hootie and the...
{}{}I can catch them on the radio.
{}{}No. Now I feel bad.|You wanna go to the concert.
{}{}...and the important thing|is that we're all together.
{}{}- All of us.|- Together.
{}{}Not at the concert.
{}{}So, the Ebola virus.|That's gotta suck, huh?
{}{}Gee, Monica.|What's in the bag?
{}{}I don't know, Chandler.|Let's take a look.
{}{}Why, it's dinner for six.|Five steaks...
{}{}...and an eggplant for Phoebe.
{}{}We switched suppliers at work, and|they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.
{}{}By the way, this didn't|seem so dorky out in the hall.
{}{}Why, it's six tickets to|Hootie and the Blowfish!
{}{}The Blowfish!
{}{}...our treat.
{}{}Thank you.
{}{}Could you be less enthused?
{}{}But it just feels like...
{}{}Like?
{}{}Charity.
{}{}We're just trying|to do a nice thing here.
{}{}But you have to understand, your|"nice thing" makes us feel about this big.
{}{}Actually, it makes us feel that big.
{}{}If you guys feel this big,|maybe that's not our fault.
{}{}Maybe that's just how you feel.
{}{}Now you're telling us how we feel.
{}{}I'm gonna pass on the concert.
{}{}I'm just not in a very|"Hootie" place right now.
{}{}- Me neither.|- Me too.
{}{}Then you'll have extra seats|for all your tiaras and stuff.
{}{}Why did you look at me|when you said that?
{}{}So I guess now we can't go.
{}{}You know what? You're right.
{}{}Fine.
{}{}All right.
{}{}It's not for another six hours.|We're gonna go then.
{}{}Are you ready?
{}{}Just let me grab my jacket|and tell you I had sex today.
{}{}It sounds even cooler|when somebody else says it!
{}{}I was awesome. She was biting her lip|to stop from screaming.
{}{}I know it's been a while,|but I took that as a good sign.
{}{}I had sex today.
{}{}I never have to|answer that phone again.
{}{}{yi}At the sound of the beep,|{yi}you know what to do.
{}{}{yi}I wanted to tell you I was really hurt|{yi}when you didn't show up yesterday.
{}{}Bob here.
{}{}{yi}Yes, I did.
{}{}So how was he?
{}{}{yi}I bit my lip to keep from|{yi}screaming your name.
{}{}Well, that makes me feel so good.
{}{}{yi}It was just so awkward and bumpy.
{}{}You have to get used to it.
{}{}{y:i}... if you know what I mean.
{}{}I know. It's my birthday.|We all should be here.
{}{}So let's go.
{}{}Well, maybe we should stay|for one song.
{}{}The guys are probably|having a great time.
{}{}Come on, you guys.|One more time.
{}{}One.
{}{}I can't believe the guys missed it!
{}{}What guys?|Oh, yeah.
{}{}Excuse me.|Aren't you Monica Geller?
{}{}Oh, my God!|Little Stevie Fisher?
{}{}How have you been?
{}{}Good. I'm a lawyer now.
{}{}It was nice to see you.|I gotta run backstage.
{}{}Wait, backstage?
{}{}My firm represents the band.
{}{}Come on.
{}{}Are you one of the ones|that fooled around with my Dad?
{}{}Hey, you guys!
{}{}Oh, thank you.
{}{}How was your night last night?
{}{}Oh, well, it pretty much sucked.|How was yours?
{}{}But I ran into Stevie Fisher.|Remember him?
{}{}Oh, yeah!|I used to baby-sit him.
{}{}Hey, how's his dad?
{}{}Aside from that, the evening|was pretty much a bust.
{}{}Yeah, we really missed you guys.
{}{}Yeah, we were just saying,|this whole thing is so stupid.
{}{}Is that a hickey?
{}{}Oh, no, I just...
{}{}I fell down.
{}{}Where'd you get the hickey?
{}{}You know, a party or...
{}{}What party?
{}{}...a gathering of people.
{}{}With food and music and...
{}{}...and the band.
{}{}Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie|are like this.
{}{}Who gave you that hickey?
{}{}That would be the work of a Blowfish.
{}{}We're just sitting at home,|trying to guess Joey's fingers...
{}{}"Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck!"
{}{}What? As part of your|"poor friends outreach program"?
{}{}Oh, great. It's work.
{}{}I don't know what to say.|I'm sorry we make more than you.
{}{}And we don't work hard?
{}{}It's Monica. I got a page.
{}{}It's just that sometimes we like|to do stuff that costs a little more.
{}{}Leon, wait.
{}{}Guys!
{}{}I don't understand.
{}{}That was not a kickback.
{}{}I'll just replace them,|and we can forget the whole thing.
{}{}What corporate policy?
{}{}Here's your check. That'll be $,.
{}{}Let me get that.
{}{}You got  bucks?
{}{}{yi}Hi, it's me.
{}{}{yi}It's been three years, and you're|{yi}probably seeing someone else now...
{}{}{yi}One hot, steamy, wild night...

{}{}Let me hold him for a sec.
{}{}Here we go.
{}{}There we are.
{}{}Don't be silly. Ben loves you.|He's just being Mr. Cranky Pants.
{}{}You know, I once dated|a Miss Cranky Pants.
{}{}Lovely girl. Kind of moody.
{}{}There's my little boy.
{}{}Can I see something?
{}{}Cool!
{}{}Come on, don't do this.
{}{}What if my own baby hates me?|What do I do then?
{}{}Monica, stop! This is nuts.
{}{}You don't even have a boyfriend yet.
{}{}Joey, she does not look fat.
{}{}The One With the Baby on the Bus
{}{}Here you go.
{}{}Goo, goo, goo!
{}{}That is so funny!|Let me see that a sec.
{}{}I don't know.
{}{}What's in this pie?
{}{}I don't know. Butter and eggs|and flour and lime and kiwi...
{}{}You said it was a key lime pie.
{}{}No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime.|That's what makes it so special.
{}{}That's what's gonna kill me.
{}{}No, you're not. You're allergic|to lobster and peanuts and...
{}{}Oh, my God!
{}{}It's definitely getting worse.
{}{}Either that or my mouth|is getting smaller!
{}{}Get your coat.|We're going to the hospital.
{}{}- Will he be okay?|- He's gotta get a shot.
{}{}Let's not go.|Anyone up for Scrabble?
{}{}Jacket, now!
{}{}What about Ben? We can't|bring a baby to the hospital.
{}{}I don't think so.
{}{}I have seven Catholic sisters.|I've taken care of hundreds of kids.
{}{}Come on, we want to do it.|Don't we?
{}{}...but I guess that's out the window.
{}{}If you take him out for a walk,|remember to bring his hat.
{}{}There's milk in the refrigerator|and diapers in the bag.
{}{}Got it!
{}{}Consider it done!
{}{}You understood?
{}{}Is he the one|with the beautiful wife?
{}{}You want to hear the song|I'm singing this afternoon?

{}{}We didn't bring enough stuff.
{}{}Did you forget to pack|the baby's anvil?
{}{}I'm telling you, it'll be worth it.
{}{}Women love guys who love babies.|It's the sensitive thing.
{}{}Aim him at that pack of babes.|Maybe one of them will break away.
{}{}Wait, forget them.|We got one. Hard left.
{}{}Come on, seriously.
{}{}Oh, seriously, you want him?
{}{}Who is this little cutie-pie?
{}{}...me.
{}{}Want to smell him?
{}{}I assume we're talking about the baby?
{}{}My uterus just skipped a beat.
{}{}What'd I tell you?
{}{}It's great you're doing this.
{}{}My brother and his boyfriend|have been trying to adopt.
{}{}What agency did you two go through?
{}{}But this is my gig.
{}{}My name is written out there in chalk.
{}{}You know, you can't just erase chalk.
{}{}Honey, I'm sorry.
{}{}Why doesn't he just give her|a throne and a crown?
{}{}And, like, a gold stick|with a ball on top?
{}{}Terry is a jerk! That's why|we always say, "Terry's a jerk!"
{}{}You probably did everything you could.
{}{}You know what? Let me just|see what else I could do.
{}{}Just let her go on after|Stephanie whatever her name is.
{}{}I don't know.
{}{}I'll clean the cappuccino machine!
{}{}You don't clean|the cappuccino machine?
{}{}I mean, I will clean it.
{}{}I mean, I will clean it.
{}{}All right, fine, fine, fine!
{}{}Who's working for you, babe?
{}{}Oh, my God! This is so exciting!|How much am I gonna get?
{}{}What?
{}{}I meant, he's paying that other woman|because she's a professional.
{}{}I'm not gonna be the only one|who's not getting paid.
{}{}I'm sorry, no!
{}{}There are thousands of places|in this city...
{}{}...where people would pay|to hear me play.
{}{}{yi}When I play, I play for me
{}{}Thank you!
{}{}I'm not getting a shot.|Maybe they can take the needle...
{}{}...and squirt it into my mouth.|Like a squirt gun.
{}{}I see someone's having|a little allergic reaction.
{}{}Doctor, can I see you|for just a moment?
{}{}My brother has|a slight phobia about needles.
{}{}My brother, the Ph.D.,|would like to know...
{}{}...if there's any way|to treat this orally?
{}{}Under these circumstances, it has to be|an injection, and it has to be now.
{}{}Go and have a seat. The doctor|says it's got to be a needle.
{}{}You're just going to have to be brave.|Can you do that for me?
{}{}Oh, boy! You are doing so good.
{}{}Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.
{}{}Honey, really.|Don't squeeze it so hard!
{}{}Let go of my hand!
{}{}...we should go to|the park and make out.

{}{}So are you the|professional guitar player?
{}{}Right. My name was on there,|but now it just says carrot cake.
{}{}So how many chords do you know?
{}{}- All of them.|- So you know D?
{}{}Do you know how to go|from D to A-minor?
{}{}So does your guitar have a strap?
{}{}Mine does.

{}{}Yes, I realize that would be|a stupid character.

{}{}Everybody, let's give a warm|Central Perk welcome to...
{}{}{y:i}Terry's a jerk|{y:i}And he won't let me work
{}{}To Stephanie Schiffer!
{}{}I'd like to start with a song I wrote|for the first man I ever loved.
{}{}{y:i}Zachary...
{}{}We're the guys that called|about the baby! Is he here?!
{}{}He's here.
{}{}I assume one of you is the father.
{}{}Actually, we're both the father.
{}{}Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy.
{}{}Please tell me you know|which one is our baby.
{}{}And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
{}{}Or clowns.
{}{}That one's Ben! Remember he had|that cute little mole by his mouth!
{}{}Okay, the mole came off.
{}{}What are we gonna do?
{}{}We'll flip for it.|Ducks or clowns.
{}{}All right, call it in the air.
{}{}Heads.
{}{}Heads, it is.
{}{}Right!
{}{}Ducks is heads|because ducks have heads.
{}{}What kind of scary-ass clowns|came to your birthday?
{}{}{yi}Just touch my cheek|{yi}Before you leave me, baby
{}{}{yi}Then slowly turn away
{}{}{yi}With me
{}{}Here. I thought you might be cold.
{}{}Thank you.
{}{}$..
{}{}But not really, because|I put in the first two.
{}{}Just to get the ball rolling|and to make myself feel better.
{}{}You know, this whole playing|for money thing is so not good for me.
{}{}I don't know, when I|sang "Su-su-suicide"...
{}{}...I got, like, $ ..
{}{}I got  cents and a condom.
{}{}So, you know, now I just feel|really bad for "Smelly Cat".
{}{}Honey, I don't think|everybody gets "Smelly Cat".
{}{}But it's not even that, you know?
{}{}I used to do my songs|because it made me happy.
{}{}Now it's just all|about the money, you know?
{}{}In fact, there was actually|a request for "Smelly Cat".
{}{}Really? From who?
{}{}Well, me.
{}{}Did I accidentally drop|a condom in your case?
{}{}It's kind of an emergency.
{}{}- Here you go.|- Thanks a lot.
{}{}I want to thank you|for being there for me.
{}{}And I'm sorry|I almost broke your hand.
{}{}That's okay.|I'm sorry I poisoned you.
{}{}Remember it? What do|you think this is, a freckle?
{}{}What about the time I hit you|in the face with Sylvian's pumpkin?
{}{}Remember when I stuck|that broom in your spokes...
{}{}But I remember|people telling me about it.
{}{}I hope Ben has a little sister.
{}{}And I hope she can kick his ass.
{}{}How about the time I cut|the legs off your Malibu Ken?
{}{}That was you?
{}{}They were infected.|He wouldn't have made it.
{}{}Come here, little one!
{}{}There's my little baby, Ben!
{}{}Hey, he's not crying!
{}{}There's still pie!
{}{}I'm here. I'm here.
{}{}How's my little boy?
{}{}Did you have fun with Uncle Joey|and Uncle Chandler today?
{}{}He rode the bus today.
{}{}Big boy riding the bus...
{}{}How come it says,|"Property of Human Services"?
{}{}You are gonna love this.
{}{}Can you hold Ben for a sec?
{}{}Stay back! I've got kiwi!|Run, Joey, run!
{}{}{y:i}What are they feeding you?
{}{}{yi}Smelly cat, smelly cat
{}{}Better!
{}{}Don't feel bad,|because it's a hard song.
{}{}- You want to try it again?|- From the top?
{}{}There is no "top", all right?
{}{}Why don't you just follow me.

{}{}No, you are not.|You are very attractive.
{}{}I go through the same thing.
{}{}I've put on weight?
{}{}Did you want to...?
{}{}No, not weight.|More like insulation.

{}{}Nope. Zilch. Nothing.
{}{}Sorry, Pheebs.
{}{}Look, I don't mind taking it slow.
{}{}He's really interesting,|and he's really sweet.
{}{}Why won't he give it up?
{}{}Maybe he drives his car|on the other side of the road.
{}{}No. What do you mean?|He's not British.
{}{}Maybe he's gay.
{}{}I don't think that's the problem.
{}{}...and just the way he held me so close|and looked into my eyes...
{}{}I just definitely felt something.
{}{}But how much can you|tell from a look?
{}{}Yo, Bing!|Racquetball in  minutes.
{}{}Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand|and smack her with it.
{}{}Oh, Rachel! Don't look.

{}{}Well, you know,|as much fun as that was...
{}{}...I've decided to opt for sanity.
{}{}Oh, yeah, come on!|I'm moving on.
{}{}He can press her up against|that window as much as he wants.
{}{}For all I care, he can throw her|through the damn thing.
{}{}Monica, I'll come by tomorrow and|pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?
{}{}If you say his full name.
{}{}Can I come over tomorrow and pick up|Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?
{}{}- You're getting a cat?|- Actually, we're getting a cat.
{}{}Together?
{}{}Both of you? Together?
{}{}Well, isn't that just lovely?
{}{}That's something you'll enjoy...
{}{}...for a really, really,|really long time.
{}{}Look at that.|I gotta go! I got a date!
{}{}With a man.
{}{}You guys have a really good night...
{}{}We're not supposed to|take these when we leave.
{}{}I don't know if Monica told you, but|this my first date since my divorce.
{}{}If I seem a little nervous...
{}{}How long do cats live?
{}{}I'm sorry?
{}{}Cats. How long do they live?
{}{}Maybe ,  years.
{}{}Well, that's just great.
{}{}Cheers!
{}{}Monica told you I was cuter|than this, didn't she?
{}{}No, Michael, it's not you.|Sorry. It's just...
{}{}It's this thing.
{}{}...but this friend of mine is|getting a cat with his girlfriend.
{}{}Oh, that does sound...
{}{}He just started going out with her.
{}{}Yeah, he wishes.
{}{}I'm sorry. Look at me.
{}{}Michael, let's talk about you.
{}{}Did you ever get a pet|with a girlfriend?
{}{}- So I figured it out.|- What?
{}{}Why Scott doesn't want|to sleep with me.
{}{}Phoebe, that's crazy.
{}{}When I first met you,|you know what I said?
{}{}I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
{}{}I mean, I'm officially offended.|But that's so sweet.
{}{}If you wanna know what the deal is,|you're gonna have to ask him.
{}{}You're right. You're right.
{}{}I mean, it's a cat, you know?|It's a cat.
{}{}Why can't they get a bug?|One of those fruit flies.
{}{}Those things that live for a day.
{}{}Fruit flies?
{}{}Thank you.
{}{}Would you like dessert?

{}{}Oh, no. You're not|having fun, are you?
{}{}No, no, I am.
{}{}Oh, look at me.
{}{}Look at me.
{}{}I'm on a date|with a really great guy.
{}{}...and his cat...
{}{}...and his Julie.
{}{}I just want to get over him.|Why can't I do that?
{}{}You can't see it because|you haven't had closure...
{}{}Closure!
{}{}That's what it is!|That's what I need!
{}{}Why didn't I think of that?|How do I get that?
{}{}Well, there's no one way|really, it's just...
{}{}Whatever it takes so that|you can finally say to him:
{}{}Over you.
{}{}That's what it is.
{}{}Closure.
{}{}Excuse me. Hel...
{}{}- Hang on.|- Excuse me?
{}{}- What?|- Hi. I'm sorry.
{}{}- I'm talking.|- I see that.
{}{}One phone call, I'll be very quick.|I'll even pay for it myself.
{}{}You're being a little weird|about your phone.
{}{}I'll call you back.
{}{}Thank you.
{}{}Machine.
{}{}Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.
{}{}I'm just calling to say that...
{}{}...everything's fine.
{}{}...and your cat.
{}{}Who, by the way, I think|you should name Michael.
{}{}You see there,|I'm thinking of names...
{}{}I am over you.
{}{}And that, my friend,|is what they call "closure".
{}{}It's Sunday morning.|I'm not running on a Sunday.
{}{}It's God's day.
{}{}If you say stop, then we stop.
{}{}Stop.
{}{}We got three more pounds to go!
{}{}I am the energy train|and you are on board!
{}{}And how was the date?
{}{}I know there was wine.
{}{}Actually, Julie's getting a cab.
{}{}I just need the cat toys.|Did Monica say...
{}{}I'm sorry. I don't know, I...
{}{}I feel like I dreamed|about you last night...
{}{}...but I don't remember.
{}{}Did we speak on the phone?|Did you call me?
{}{}No. I stayed at Julie's last night.
{}{}I haven't even been home yet.|Do you mind if I check my messages?
{}{}Rach, I got a message from you!
{}{}Who's Michael?
{}{}Oh, my God!
{}{}Give me the...
{}{}You're over me?
{}{}Oh, God!
{}{}You're over me?
{}{}When were you...
{}{}...under me?
{}{}I mean, were you?
{}{}What?
{}{}Basically...
{}{}I've sort of had feelings for you.
{}{}You've had feelings for me?
{}{}So? You had feelings for me first!
{}{}You know?
{}{}Chandler told me.
{}{}When did he? When did he?|When did he?
{}{}Meeting Julie.
{}{}Julie. That's...|Oh, God!
{}{}I need to lie down.
{}{}I'm gonna stand...
{}{}...and I'm gonna walk.|I'm walking and I am standing.
{}{}Now you're over me?
{}{}That's Julie.
{}{}I'll be right down!
{}{}Well, okay, I have to.|I can't deal with this right now.
{}{}I mean, I've...|You know, I've got a cab.
{}{}I've got a girlfriend.|I'm gonna go get a cat.
{}{}- Hey, Joey.|- Hey, Pheebs.
{}{}How come you're watching|a rabbi play electric guitar?
{}{}I can't find the remote.
{}{}Scott asked me to come over|for lunch and I did.
{}{}- And?|- And we did.
{}{}All right! Way to go!
{}{}So how did it happen?
{}{}I took your advice and|asked him what was going on.
{}{}What did he say?
{}{}And he was just afraid|that I was going to get all
{}{}"Is he gonna call me the next day?"|and "Where is this going?"
{}{}So he said he wanted to hold off|until he was prepared to be serious.
{}{}Sex can be just about two people|right there in the moment.
{}{}If he wants to see me again, he can|call. If not, that's fine too.
{}{}So after a lot of talking...
{}{}Let me get this straight.
{}{}He got you to beg to sleep with him.
{}{}He got you to say|he never has to call you again.
{}{}This man is my god!
{}{}I didn't get a cat.
{}{}That's interesting.
{}{}It's actually %|the opposite of interesting.
{}{}I got it, Ross.
{}{}You had no right to say|you had feelings for me.
{}{}I was doing great|before I knew about you!
{}{}You think it's easy|to see you with Julie?
{}{}You should've said something before!
{}{}There was never a good time.
{}{}You only had a year.|And we only hung out every night!
{}{}Not...
{}{}It's not like I didn't try.|But things got in the way.
{}{}You know, like Italian guys...
{}{}...or ex-fiancés...
{}{}There was one Italian guy, okay?|And do you have a point?
{}{}The point is, I don't need|this right now!
{}{}Okay? It's too late.
{}{}You're just gonna put away|your feelings for me?
{}{}I've done it since ninth grade.|I'm good at it.
{}{}All right, fine.|You go ahead and do that.
{}{}- Good.|- Good!
{}{}And you know what?|Now I got closure!
{}{}Try the bottom one.
{}{}We're not working out.|It's over.
{}{}No way! With one pound to go?|Come on!
{}{}{yi}We're workin', we're movin'|{yi}We're in the zone, we're groovin'
{}{}In fact, I kind of like the last pound.
{}{}So don't make me do anything|that I'll regret.
{}{}What you gonna do, fat boy?
{}{}Nothing. Except tell you it's|wonderful how much energy you have.
{}{}Well, thanks.
{}{}Especially considering how tough|it's been for you to find work.
{}{}It's not as if you have|a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
{}{}Well, no. But I...
{}{}If it were me, I'd have difficulty|getting out of bed at all.
{}{}So you...
{}{}You feel like going for a run?
{}{}All right.

{}{}For a hotline, you're not so hot.

{}{}It was horrible. She cried, I cried.|She threw things, they hit me.
{}{}So Spock actually hugs his father?
{}{}Hey, do you guys have...
{}{}Where you going?
{}{}...from Julie's.
{}{}No, no.
{}{}It's not what you think.
{}{}Well, what's the other thing?|What do I think?

{}{}What is this?
{}{}Okay. Just remember how crazy|I am about you, okay?
{}{}"Kind of ditzy"?
{}{}"Too into her looks"?
{}{}A little spoiled. He was supposed|to type "little", the idiot!
{}{}"Just a waitress"?
{}{}Now that was...
{}{}Okay, is this over yet? Rach?
{}{}I do not have chubby ankles!
{}{}No! I...
{}{}"She's not Rachem"?
{}{}What the hell's a Rachem?
{}{}Is that a stupid paleontology word...
{}{}Rach, come on!
{}{}It's "She's not Rachel"!
{}{}She's not...
{}{}If I'd said it was my diary,|she wouldn't have made me read it.
{}{}That's true. You'd be a great person|to have around after an emergency.
{}{}I cannot believe Ross|even made this list.
{}{}Hey, cut him some slack.|It was Chandler's idea.
{}{}What?
{}{}Oh, good. I was hoping|that would come up.
{}{}Let's get some perspective here.|These things happen for a reason.
{}{}Yeah. You!
{}{}Pheebs, back me up. You believe|in that karma crap, don't you?
{}{}Rach!
{}{}Hey! Open up! Please?
{}{}When somebody does not buzz you in,|Ross, that means, "Go away".

{}{}Come on, open up.
{}{}No.
{}{}- No?|- That's what I said.
{}{}Maybe we should go.

{}{}No! You don't, Ross.
{}{}Imagine the worst things|you think about yourself.
{}{}...not only thinks them too...
{}{}...but actually uses them|as reasons not to be with you.
{}{}No, but see, I want to be with you|in spite of all those things.
{}{}I said, don't go!
{}{}You know what?
{}{}If it were the other way around, there|is nothing you could put on a list...
{}{}Well, then I guess that's|the difference between us.
{}{}See, I'd never make a list.
{}{}I never know how long to wait|in this situation before you can talk.
{}{}In these recipes,|the quantities may seem unusual.
{}{}Like these coconut Macholate|holiday nut bars?
{}{}I've indicated four cups of coconut|and four cups of nuts...
{}{}Doesn't matter.
{}{}Our FDA approval didn't come through.
{}{}Something about laboratory rats.
{}{}Yeah.
{}{}Anyhow, here's your check.
{}{}Thank you for all the trouble|you went through.
{}{}Well, I ate some.
{}{}Oh, some is fine.|Some is not a lot.
{}{}So it doesn't burn|when you pee, does it?
{}{}Tell him I'd come to the phone,|but my ankles are weighing me down.
{}{}I don't think this is the best time.
{}{}Look, can you do something for me?
{}{}All right.
{}{}Music?
{}{}Sure.
{}{}{yi}Rachel, he wants you to know|{yi}he's sorry for what he did...
{}{}{yi}See the stones set in your eyes
{}{}{yi}I'll wait for you
{}{}{y:i}On a bed of nails she makes me wait
{}{}{yi}We've just gotten a call from Rachel|{yi}and she told us what Ross did.
{}{}{y:i}... I don't want to play|{y:i}your song anymore.
{}{}{yi}Avery, Michelle's sorry|{yi}she hit you with her car...
{}{}{yi}There's a room where
{}{}{yi}And tell my secrets to
{}{}{y:i}In my room
{}{}Not at all. I have no morals,|and I need the cash.
{}{}It's like I'm looking in a mirror.
{}{}Anyway, they're called Fish-tachios.

{}{}How much did you tip the super?
{}{}We were gonna give ,|but we don't wanna look bad.
{}{}And  it is.
{}{}You gave cookies?
{}{}Money is so impersonal.
{}{}We're broke,|but cookies do say that.
{}{}I can see that.
{}{}A plate of brownies told me a limerick.
{}{}Not especially.
{}{}But I think they had pot in them.
{}{}So who else did you tip|with cookies?
{}{}And the newspaper delivery guy.
{}{}Oh, my God.

{}{}These are cookies smashed|to the sports section.
{}{}He did my crossword puzzle.
{}{}Yeah, but not very well, unless| across, "Gershwin musical"...

{}{}Hey, guys.
{}{}I got you a little present.
{}{}I'll open it.
{}{}It's a Slinky!
{}{}{yi}Walks downstairs|{yi}Alone or in pairs
{}{}Just a big spring.
{}{}Horrible list of reasons|not to be with me?
{}{}How about we just call it|the "unfortunate incident"?
{}{}Hey, Gunther.|You got stairs in your place?
{}{}Hey, guys.
{}{}What's in the bag?
{}{}Some presents.
{}{}You know you want to.
{}{}This is a picture frame|from Ben to my parents.
{}{}Oh, that's cute.
{}{}And I got this blouse for Mom.
{}{}Ross, that is gorgeous!
{}{}Look at these authentic fake metals!
{}{}...at the make-believe|military academy!
{}{}Happy "Christmas Eve" Eve.
{}{}Oh, my God!|Where did you get this?
{}{}This is my father!
{}{}This is a picture of my dad!
{}{}That's the guy|that comes in the frame.
{}{}I thought your dad was in prison.
{}{}No, that's my stepdad.
{}{}My real dad's the one that|ran out on us before I was born.
{}{}Look, see? This is him.
{}{}My mother gave me this picture|before she died. Same guy!
{}{}This is a picture of the frame guy...
{}{}It's not a blue screen.|It's just...
{}{}Maybe it was just|really clear that day.
{}{}Okay, I have to talk|to my grandmother.
{}{}I'm trying to get my boss's|ex-wife to sleep with me.

{}{}Hi, Pooh.
{}{}Hi, Gram. What you doing?

{}{}Another graduation.

{}{}Is this really my father?

{}{}In all the years we've been|grandmother and granddaughter...
{}{}All right, that's not your father.|It's a picture of a guy in a frame.
{}{}Oh, God.
{}{}It was your mother's idea.
{}{}...because he hurt her so much.
{}{}I didn't want to do it.
{}{}But then she died|and it was harder to argue with her.
{}{}All right. So he's not|a famous tree surgeon?
{}{}And I guess he doesn't live in a hut|in Burma where there's no phones?
{}{}Last I heard, he was|a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
{}{}Why would the villagers|worship a pharmacist?
{}{}Honey.
{}{}Anyway, that's all I know.

{}{}This...
{}{}...is the real him.

{}{}Yeah, big stuff!
{}{}Okay, let's go!
{}{}Here, you have to hold this.
{}{}That's my cheat sheet.

{}{}Did you just break the radiator?
{}{}No, I was turning the knob and...
{}{}Well, put it back!
{}{}It won't go back.

{}{}That's right. I forgot about|your ability to fuse metal.
{}{}Hey, it's Funny's cousin...
{}{}...Not Funny!
{}{}It's Rachel Greene from upstairs.

{}{}Your guests are turning into jerky.
{}{}Really?|I'm perfectly comfortable.
{}{}Mr. Treeger.
{}{}You said there was a party.
{}{}Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.
{}{}Probably because I have so much skin.
{}{}Hey, cheese!
{}{}Here's the chance.|Monica, give him cash.
{}{}No, I will not cave.
{}{}I'm with Mon.
{}{}All right. You know how you say|I never seize the day?
{}{}Mr. Treeger?
{}{}Here is $.|Merry Christmas.
{}{}I didn't get you anything.
{}{}No, that's your Christmas tip.
{}{}Do you think there's a chance|you can fix that radiator now?
{}{}No can do.|Like I told the girl...
{}{}Ross?
{}{}He's playing baseball.
{}{}You mean hardball?
{}{}What you gonna do?
{}{}Excuse me. I'm seizing.
{}{}Mr. Treeger?
{}{}Happy Hanukkah.
{}{}Will this help|with the knob-getting?
{}{}No, the place is not open|till Tuesday.
{}{}So you really did like my cookies?
{}{}Yeah, they were so personal.|It really showed you cared.
{}{}Nice seizing...

{}{}No, that...
{}{}That is basil.
{}{}No, it's still basil.

{}{}What's going on?
{}{}It's just like|a whole mess of stuff.
{}{}And you know, now he's|a pharmacist guy and...
{}{}Well, maybe he's this|really cool pharmacist guy.
{}{}Yeah, maybe!|And I'll knock on the door...
{}{}I'll go to his pharmacy and|everyone will be nice to me...
{}{}...because, you know,|I'm Frank's daughter.
{}{}So why not go knock?
{}{}What if he's still the dirtbag|who ran out on my mom and us?
{}{}You know what?
{}{}I've already lost|a fake dad this week.
{}{}Pheebs, that's okay.|You took a big step today.
{}{}Someday, when you're ready,|you'll make it past the hedges.
{}{}And when you do,|he'll be lucky to have you.
{}{}Sorry about your shopping.
{}{}Oh, that's okay.|We'll figure something out.
{}{}I know you're not going in there...
{}{}That's fine, never mind.
{}{}Cool, snow!
{}{}Kind of like a blank canvas.
{}{}You mind if I turn the heat down?
{}{}We could have used|that kind of thinking earlier!
{}{}So, Pheebs, how did it go?
{}{}- Honey, I'm sorry.|- Are you okay?
{}{}Yeah, it's okay,|because I know he's there.
{}{}So that's enough for now.
{}{}Oh, right! Merry Christmas!
{}{}The knob was broken...

{}{}Sorry.
{}{}Is she good-looking?
{}{}She's totally good-looking.|If I met her in a bar...
{}{}After having slept with her.
{}{}Maybe this isn't such a big deal.
{}{}The way that I see it is, you get a|great job, and you get to have sex!
{}{}I just don't think that|I want it that way, though.
{}{}I mean, let's say|I do make it, all right?

{}{}You fell off the wagon!
{}{}Oh, no, no.
{}{}What about me?
{}{}I think you may have|a drinking problem.
{}{}What, these?
{}{}Look, I'm not strong enough to be|in a codependent relationship.
{}{}Oh, shoot.
{}{}Well, anyway,|I hope we can be friends.
{}{}- You too.|- Goodbye.
{}{}What happened?
{}{}We kind of broke up.
{}{}I'll take one.
{}{}Sometimes I hold stuff like this|and pretend I'm a giant.

{}{}...she probably woke up|this morning and thought...
{}{}...I'll have some breakfast,|take a walk, then have my massage.
{}{}Little did she know God thought,|"Okay, but that's it."
{}{}...I was cleansing her aura|when it happened.
{}{}And when her spirit|left her body...
{}{}...I don't think it went very far.
{}{}I think it went into me.
{}{}This is so hard.
{}{}I can't decide|between lamb or duck.
{}{}Or the movie would've been called|{yi}Silence of the Ducks.
{}{}Okay, who ordered what?
{}{}I had the half-drunk cappuccino|with the lipstick on the rim.
{}{}Oh, God.
{}{}You're so uptight|about your mom coming.
{}{}I know. I just don't want|her to think that because...
{}{}Talk about crap, just|listen to Stella Neidman...
{}{}...tell her story about Rod Steiger|for the hundredth time.
{}{}Pheebs? How long do you think|this lady will be with us?
{}{}Sit up!
{}{}There she is!
{}{}- Mom!|- Hey, sweetie!
{}{}Oh, it's wonderful!
{}{}Is it a living room?|Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?
{}{}I guess that's the fun.
{}{}Monica! You look gorgeous!
{}{}Oh, my! The last time I saw you,|it was eat or be eaten.
{}{}This is Joey.
{}{}This is Chandler.
{}{}You remember Ross?
{}{}Oh, hello, Ross.
{}{}What do you think of my|daughter, in the apron...
{}{}...with the big job!
{}{}Oh, Mom!
{}{}Believe me, sometimes that happens.
{}{}This is just so exciting!|You know, I never worked.
{}{}I went from my father's house|to the sorority house...
{}{}Really?
{}{}I know who you remind me of.
{}{}Evelyn Durmer.
{}{}Pheebs? Who's Evelyn Durmer?
{}{}I don't know.|Who's Soupy Sales?
{}{}Oh, my God!
{}{}Just be glad he's not playing|a smaller instrument.
{}{}You have some life here, sweetie!
{}{}Mom, I realize you were upset|when I didn't marry Barry...
{}{}This is just|so much better for me.
{}{}I know.|You didn't love Barry, honey.
{}{}And I've never seen you this happy.
{}{}For me.
{}{}Well, not just for you.
{}{}What do you mean?
{}{}All right, tell me|if this is too cute.
{}{}Lesbian wedding...|chicken breasts.
{}{}Oh, God.|I think I'm gonna be sick.
{}{}- You had no idea?|- None.
{}{}They didn't fight?
{}{}No, they didn't even|talk to each other.
{}{}You know, in my day,|divorce was not an option.
{}{}Hey, look who's up!
{}{}I just can't believe|this is happening!
{}{}I figured as an adult,|I wouldn't have to worry about it.
{}{}Can't you look at this|as flattering?
{}{}She just wants to be like you.
{}{}When my parents divorced,|they sent me to a shrink...
{}{}...and she told me|that kids blame themselves.
{}{}But in your case,|it's actually kind of true.
{}{}Damn! My mail-order|grandfather hasn't come yet.
{}{}- Phoebe?|- Hi, Mr. Adelman.
{}{}- Nice to see you.|- Thanks for coming.
{}{}Do you wanna sit?
{}{}No, I spent most of my morning|trying to stand up.
{}{}What can I do|for you, my dear?
{}{}I think when your wife's spirit|left her body...
{}{}...it kind of stuck around...
{}{}...in me.
{}{}Yeah. You don't have to|believe me, but...
{}{}...can you think of|any unfinished business she had?
{}{}Any reason to hang around?
{}{}All I can think of is that...
{}{}...she used to say that before she died,|she wanted to see everything.
{}{}- Everything?|- Everything.
{}{}Oh, wait, I...
{}{}I remember she also said she wanted|to sleep with me one last time.
{}{}I'm sorry.|There's laughing in my head.
{}{}Look at this!
{}{}These are all Halloween,|three years ago.
{}{}Oh, and look, here's Barry.
{}{}Oh, no.|That was his costume.
{}{}See, he's actually an orthodontist,|but he came as a regular dentist.
{}{}You guys?
{}{}Actually, I think you said...
{}{}..."Don't touch that|and get out of my kitchen."
{}{}Really? Weird.|Anyway...
{}{}I just didn't plan|enough time to do it.
{}{}- You want some help?|- Lf you want.
{}{}What a day!
{}{}The Museum of Modern Art,|Rockefeller Center...
{}{}...the Statue of Liberty.
{}{}She's still with you?
{}{}Be right back. She has to go|to the bathroom again.
{}{}Such a pretty face!
{}{}Oh, this is so much fun!|Just the girls!
{}{}God!
{}{}Look, no one's smoking pot|around all this food.
{}{}Well, that's fine.
{}{}What's new in sex?
{}{}What's new in sex?
{}{}The only man I've been with|is your father.
{}{}This is no offense to your dad,|but I was thinking...
{}{}...there might be more.
{}{}You know what? I cannot|have this conversation with you.
{}{}You come here and drop this bomb on me|before you even tell Daddy.
{}{}Do you want my blessing?|Want me to talk you out of it?
{}{}Then what do you want?
{}{}Why on earth|would I understand this?
{}{}You didn't marry your Barry, honey.
{}{}But I married mine.
{}{}Move, move, move!
{}{}I feel like you should|have German subtitles.
{}{}Joey, speed it up!
{}{}How did this happen?|I thought you had this planned out.
{}{}Do you want me to cry?
{}{}Is that what you want?
{}{}Sir, no, sir!
{}{}All right, you!
{}{}No. Look, I told you,|I am not a part of this thing.
{}{}But if you don't help,|I'm gonna take those hot dogs...
{}{}...and create an appetizer|called "Pigs In Ross".
{}{}All right, ball a melon!
{}{}- How's it going?|- Great! Right on schedule.
{}{}Got my little happy helpers.
{}{}That's fine. Whatever.
{}{}Nothing.
{}{}Okay, everything.|I think we're calling off the wedding.
{}{}You're still gonna pay me, right?
{}{}What's the matter?|What happened?
{}{}My parents called to say|they weren't coming.
{}{}I knew they were|having trouble with this, but...
{}{}Susan and I fought because|I said maybe we should call it off.
{}{}She said, "This isn't for them.|It's for us."
{}{}And if I couldn't see that,|we should cancel the wedding.
{}{}I can't believe I'm gonna say this,|but I think Susan's right.
{}{}You do?
{}{}Do you love her? And don't be|too emphatic about this.
{}{}Well then, that's it.
{}{}If George and Adelaide can't|accept that, then the hell with them.
{}{}If my parents didn't want me|to marry you...
{}{}Look, this is your wedding.
{}{}Do it.
{}{}You're right.|Of course you're right.
{}{}We're back on.
{}{}You heard the woman!|Peel! Chop! Devil!
{}{}Can't believe|I lost two minutes!
{}{}You know?|All these women, and nothing!
{}{}I feel like Superman|without my powers, you know?
{}{}I have the cape,|and yet I cannot fly.
{}{}The world is my lesbian wedding.
{}{}Butterscotch?
{}{}No one?
{}{}- Thank you.|- Anytime.
{}{}Ross.
{}{}Nothing makes God happier...
{}{}Friends, family,|we're gathered here today...
{}{}...to join Carol and Susan|in holy matrimony.
{}{}Oh, my God!
{}{}She's gone!

{}{}Yeah. Can't help but.
{}{}How's that pig-in-the-blanket|working out for you?
{}{}I wrapped those bad boys.
{}{}Oh, yeah?
{}{}I know it's kind of weird, but|she was a big part of my life...
{}{}I don't know, I feel alone.
{}{}I think it's time you forget about Rose,|move on with your life.
{}{}How about we get you a drink?
{}{}Okay. So nice!
{}{}Hey, Mom, having fun?
{}{}Am I! I just danced|with a wonderfully large woman.
{}{}And three other girls|made eyes at me over at the buffet.
{}{}...but it's nice to know|I have options.
{}{}There's more alcohol, right?
{}{}How you doing?
{}{}You wanna dance?
{}{}No, that's fine.
{}{}Come on.
{}{}Look, penis, schmenis!
{}{}Okay? We're all people.
{}{}Which one of us is gonna be|the first one to get married?
{}{}- Yeah, me too, technically.|- I had a wedding.
{}{}Just trying to|start a discussion.
{}{}Which one do you think|will be the last to get married?
{}{}Of course!
{}{}Absolutely.

{}{}That commercial always|makes me so sad.
{}{}But then the guy opens his beer|and girls run at him...
{}{}...so everything works out okay.
{}{}I can see that.
{}{}Because they both have those big|brown eyes and the little pouty chin.
{}{}And the fact that|they're both monkeys?
{}{}Ross, you had to. He was|humping everything in sight.

{}{}In Crazy World, that means|you're married.
{}{}It's not addressed to "Days Of Our Lives".|This came to your apartment.
{}{}She was in our building.
{}{}I got my very own stalker!
{}{}Where are you off to?
{}{}There's a paleontology|conference in L.A.
{}{}He will be surprised.|Till he realizes he's a monkey...
{}{}...and isn't capable of that emotion.
{}{}Phoebe? That really cute guy|is here again.
{}{}...pretend I'm telling you a story|and it's really funny.
{}{}So everyone just laugh. Now!
{}{}I know, I know!
{}{}Hi, Rob Donan.
{}{}I don't know anything about music,|but I think you're really great.
{}{}Anyway, I schedule performers|for children's libraries.
{}{}I would love to have kids...
{}{}...hear me play the songs|that I will write for them.
{}{}What do we do for dinner?
{}{}{yi}It's Erika.
{}{}My God. The stalker!
{}{}{y:i}Never mind. It's open.

{}{}That's how radio stars|escape stalkers!
{}{}She's coming!
{}{}This is it.|This is how we're gonna die.
{}{}You ready?
{}{}Wait, wait, wait!
{}{}- Mr. Geller?|- Yes, hi.
{}{}Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.
{}{}You had a question?
{}{}...answers to the name Marcel?
{}{}I'm afraid I have some bad news.
{}{}Marcel has passed on.
{}{}He got sick,|and then he got sicker...
{}{}...and then he got a little better.
{}{}But then he died.
{}{}I'm sorry, Mr. Geller.|But you know, there's an old saying
{}{}"Sometimes monkeys die."
{}{}It's not a great saying...
{}{}- Someone should've called me.|- I'm sorry.
{}{}Look, I know this can't|bring him back...
{}{}...but here, it's just a gesture.
{}{}Yes, and come see the bird show|at . The macaws wear hats.
{}{}It's a lot cuter|if your monkey hasn't just died.
{}{}I know.
{}{}What is she like?
{}{}You remember Kathy Bates in "Misery"?
{}{}Well, she looks|the exact opposite of that.
{}{}Oh, no, no.|She's a total whack-job.
{}{}She thinks that Joey is|actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.
{}{}Oh, my God!
{}{}He cannot pursue this.
{}{}Just because this woman sees Joey|through the magical bo x...
{}{}...in her living room|doesn't mean she's not a person.
{}{}Why are you looking at me? He's|the one who wants to boff the maniac!
{}{}Are you okay?
{}{}No. I'm just nervous.
{}{}That's not a good idea. That's|the reason the last guy got fired.
{}{}I'm used to playing for grownups.
{}{}Grownups drink their coffee|and do their grownup thing.
{}{}...listen.
{}{}It's just a huge responsibility.
{}{}What?
{}{}I was thinking about it.
{}{}Alrighty! Let's play some tunes!

{}{}Well, here we sit, devil-may-care...
{}{}...and a while ago you were|reattaching Simone's spinal cord.
{}{}That was a tricky one.
{}{}...that operation takes  hours.|But they only showed it for  minutes.
{}{}Who's "they"?
{}{}No one.
{}{}Oh, these hands,|these beautiful hands.
{}{}I could just eat them.
{}{}But I won't.
{}{}No, seriously.
{}{}These hands...
{}{}...these miracle, magical,|life-giving hands.
{}{}All right. Just one.
{}{}You're good at that.
{}{}Oh, my God! Someone!|He's choking!
{}{}Yes, the best doctor in Salem!
{}{}Dr. Drake Ramoray!
{}{}Meet me in the nocturnal|house in  minutes.
{}{}But, zoo dollars?
{}{}It's about your monkey!
{}{}It's alive.
{}{}Because I'm a neurosurgeon...
{}{}...and that was clearly a case of...
{}{}..."foodal chokage".
{}{}You don't have to tell me anything.
{}{}You don't have to|explain yourself to me.
{}{}Who am I to question|the great Dr. Drake Ramoray?
{}{}Hey, I...
{}{}Hey what?
{}{}That's it. Just hey!
{}{}{yi}There'll be times when you get older
{}{}{y:i}Just to make them like you|{y:i}But don't!
{}{}{yi}... that's another thing...
{}{}{y:i}That's another thing|{y:i}That you don't wanna do
{}{}Not at all inappropriate!
{}{}Thank you for coming, everybody!|There are cookies in the back.
{}{}That was great.
{}{}Yea! I rock!
{}{}And you know why?|Because you told the truth.
{}{}Nobody ever tells kids the truth.
{}{}But...?
{}{}- How'd you know there was a "but"?|- I sense these things.
{}{}It was either "but" or "butter".
{}{}...they were hoping that...
{}{}...you'd play more songs|about barnyard animals.
{}{}I can do that.
{}{}Because that would be fantastic!
{}{}What? You wanna kiss me?
{}{}I'm thinking about it.

{}{}Oh, yeah, right.
{}{}There was a break-in...
{}{}...a few months back.|Inside job.
{}{}The zoo told me|that my monkey was dead!
{}{}The zoo!
{}{}You believe everything|the zoo tells you?
{}{}Of course they'll say that!|They don't want the bad publicity.
{}{}It's all a great big cover-up.
{}{}Do you have any idea|how high up this thing goes?
{}{}Lipson knows?
{}{}Lipson knows, huh?
{}{}Hello, Mr. Possum.
{}{}- Taunting gravity...|- Buddy, my monkey. My monkey?
{}{}Word on the street...
{}{}When I say "street", I mean those|pretend streets here at the zoo.
{}{}Your monkey found a new career...
{}{}...in the entertainment field.|That's all I know.
{}{}This is unbelievable!
{}{}Are you trying|to get me to bribe you?
{}{}Maybe.
{}{}But you already told me everything.
{}{}He actually is|the Monkeyshine monkey!
{}{}What'll you do?
{}{}I'm gonna call the beer company|and try to find him.
{}{}Okay, hi again!
{}{}Hi, Phoebe!
{}{}Today, we're gonna start with|some songs about barnyard animals.
{}{}{yi}Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"
{}{}{yi}And that's how we get hamburgers
{}{}{yi}Only you who can save her, Drake!
{}{}There goes my whole belief system.
{}{}Quick! Shut off the TV.
{}{}I wanna see what happens!
{}{}I get Leslie out of the coma|then we make out.
{}{}Rachel, it's a world|where Joey is a neurosurgeon.
{}{}Hey, Erika. Come in.
{}{}How did you get here so fast?|I just saw you in Salem.
{}{}What's up?
{}{}You're having a little party too!
{}{}- Is she here?|- Who?
{}{}I saw you today, kissing|in the doctor's lounge.
{}{}It's not what you think...
{}{}You told me I was the only one!
{}{}We shouldn't see each other anymore.
{}{}I should have told you|a long time ago...
{}{}...but I am not Drake Ramoray.
{}{}Oh, my God! Do the people|at the hospital know?
{}{}Somebody wanna help me out here?
{}{}Oh, I know! I know!
{}{}{yi}University Hospital...
{}{}How can you be here and there?
{}{}What are you getting at?
{}{}I'm not Drake!
{}{}That's right!|He's not Drake. He's...
{}{}Is this true?
{}{}Yes! Yes, it is true!
{}{}And I know this...
{}{}And then he told me|he would run away with me!
{}{}And he didn't!
{}{}And you left the toilet seat up,|you bastard!
{}{}Yes, I'm afraid it is.
{}{}You deserve much better than me.
{}{}You deserve to be with the real Drake.|He's the one you fell in love with.
{}{}He's the guy for you!
{}{}Oh, Hans!
{}{}Hans?
{}{}Yo, evil twin!
{}{}Right. Goodbye, Erika.
{}{}Good luck in Salem.
{}{}I'll never forget you, Hans.
{}{}All right.|The people who threw the water!
{}{}Helping you out!
{}{}Why?
{}{}The library board got a lot|of complaints from parents...
{}{}...about the stuff in your songs.
{}{}Did you tell your board that|the kids want to hear the truth?
{}{}I see.
{}{}Maybe if you just played|some regular kiddy songs?
{}{}...stupid, big,|like, purple dinosaur?
{}{}You don't have to be Barney.
{}{}Who's Barney?
{}{}...and he's in New York filming|{yi}Outbreak  The Virus Takes Manhattan.
{}{}You're kidding!
{}{}- This is amazing!|- I know.
{}{}Rachel, I'm ready.
{}{}Excuse me. Is this where the|singing lady is, who tells the truth?
{}{}I guess that's me.
{}{}{yi}Sometimes men love women
{}{}{yi}Then there are bisexuals
{}{}This is exciting! I haven't|seen my monkey in a year.
{}{}What, you never|look down in the shower?
{}{}I'm not allowed to make one joke|in the "monkey is penis" genre?
{}{}Back up. Come on.
{}{}Excuse me.|Where can we find the monkey?
{}{}I'm sorry.|It's a closed set.
{}{}We used to live together.

{}{}I tracked down Marcel. And get this
{}{}Hey, buddy! Marcel!

{}{}Good morning.
{}{}Look who I brought!
{}{}Whoa, dude. Burn!
{}{}I don't get it.

{}{}Hey, Sal?

{}{}Yes, it is.

{}{}Do you know me or are you|just really good at this game?
{}{}Fourth grade? Glasses?
{}{}I carried a bo x of|animal crackers like a purse?
{}{}Susie Moss!
{}{}You look...
{}{}Great job growing up.
{}{}It's nice to see you don't still|wear the cap with the mirrors on it.
{}{}Remember the class play?
{}{}You pulled up my skirt and the|entire auditorium saw my underpants?
{}{}Yes. Back then, I used humor|as a defense mechanism.
{}{}- Oh, my God!|- What? What?
{}{}It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.
{}{}I didn't know he was in|this movie. He is so hot!
{}{}The Muscles from Brussels?|Wham-Bam-Van-Damme?
{}{}Did you see "Time Cop"?
{}{}No. Was he any good in it?
{}{}So why don't you go talk to him?
{}{}Go tell him he's cute.|What's the worst that could happen?
{}{}He could hear me.
{}{}Don't!
{}{}Tell him I cook!
{}{}Excuse me.
{}{}...but my friend over there...
{}{}...who cooks, by the way...
{}{}She thinks you're cute.
{}{}I don't know.
{}{}Do you think you're cute?
{}{}We're getting off the track.|I was supposed to tell you...
{}{}What should I tell her?
{}{}You can tell her|I think her friend is cute.
{}{}- Makeup!|- That's me. I gotta go.
{}{}Well, let's try one more.
{}{}I'll be there.
{}{}...I'll get to see your underwear.
{}{}No one was around to hear that?
{}{}So what'd he say?
{}{}I kept talking about you,|and he kept asking me out.
{}{}Naturally, you know, I said no.
{}{}Thanks, anyway.
{}{}...and asking, asking, asking...
{}{}If you want to go out|with him, you can.
{}{}Sounds like a jerk to me, but...
{}{}Thank you.
{}{}Then Jean-Claude took me|to Crossroads...
{}{}...and we hung out|with Drew Barrymore.
{}{}She's got the greatest set of...
{}{}No guys around, huh?
{}{}- Does anybody need anything?|- I'll have an espresso.
{}{}If I ask you to, you'll end up|drinking it yourself.
{}{}- That is so unfair.|- I know.
{}{}Like you'd drink her coffee after|what you did to her with Van Damme?
{}{}Marcel's trainer will let me|have him for a couple of hours.
{}{}You're blowing me off for a monkey?
{}{}We can reschedule for Saturday.
{}{}Stick a fork in me...
{}{}...I am done!
{}{}Stick a fork what?
{}{}I don't eat meat.
{}{}How do you know vegetables are done?
{}{}Well, you don't.|You eat them and you can tell.
{}{}I've met the perfect woman.
{}{}We're sitting on her couch,|fooling around...
{}{}...and then she turns to me and says
{}{}What did you say?
{}{}I believe my exact words were...
{}{}How do you know if you wanna do that?
{}{}We gotta go.|Got a reservation in  minutes.
{}{}What I had planned shouldn't take|more than two, three minutes, tops.
{}{}Two hundred seconds of passion!|We gotta go.
{}{}...here's an idea.
{}{}Have you ever worn women's underwear?
{}{}Well, yes, actually...
{}{}And there were three of us in there.
{}{}I was thinking|it would be kind of sexy...
{}{}...if you wore mine tonight|at dinner.
{}{}Could you?
{}{}If I was wearing your underwear...
{}{}...then what would you be wearing?
{}{}I made Marcel's favorite dish,|banana cake...
{}{}...with mealworm.
{}{}Candle.
{}{}Hi, are you on your way over...
{}{}No, I understand.|A monkey's gotta work.
{}{}It's no big deal.
{}{}Rachel, why don't you|start talking first?
{}{}I feel that this is|totally unjustified.
{}{}She gave me the green light,|I did nothing...
{}{}If there's something|you'd like to share...
{}{}You had no right to date him!
{}{}- That's the most ridiculous...|- You sold me out!
{}{}Would you let me talk!
{}{}Did you just flick me?
{}{}Well, you wouldn't let me|finish and I was...
{}{}Quit flicking!
{}{}Stop flicking!
{}{}You flicked me first!
{}{}Happy thoughts!
{}{}Now I'm gonna kick some ass!
{}{}All right. Now, I will|let go if you both stop.
{}{}You want me to just tell him|you're seeing him instead?
{}{}Is that what you want?
{}{}That's what you want?
{}{}There we go.
{}{}If we were in prison,|you guys would be, like, my bitches.
{}{}Thanks for letting me tag along.
{}{}How you doing there, squirmy?
{}{}I'm hanging in.
{}{}And a little out.
{}{}That's an exciting job. You must|have a ton of responsibilities...
{}{}I don't do the casting.
{}{}So what are you guys gonna eat?
{}{}...and licking you all over?
{}{}Because I went to an all-boys high|school, and God is making up for it?
{}{}I want you right here...
{}{}Right now, right here?
{}{}Don't you think we're in|kind of a public place?

Well, I'm making money now.
I'm paying you back for headshots,
electric bills, all that pizza...
I love you, man.
Well, thanks, man.
Now I can get my pony.
This is a little extra something for...
...always being there for me.
Wow, I don't know what to say.
Wow, I don't know what to say.
What do you say?
I don't know.
It's a bracelet.
Isn't it? It's engraved, too.

- This all looks good.
on your last job...?
That's right there, see?
The manager, Chandler Bing?
All right.
Let's see if you're as good in person
as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
A salad? I could do
you're doing while you're doing it.
All right. Well,
I'm tearing the lettuce.
Is it dirty?
Oh, I'm gonna wash it.
Don't. I like it dirty.
That's your call.
So, what are you going to do next?
I thought that I'd
cut up the tomatoes.
Are they firm?
They're okay.
You sure they haven't gone bad?
You sure they're not very, very bad?
No, really, they're okay.
You gonna slice them up real nice?
I was going to do them julienne.
I'm out of here!
Hello?
Rachel's not here.
or "and The Sunshine Band"?
Hey, who's this Casey?
A guy she met at the movies.
What does he want with her?
I guess he wants to
do a little dance...
...you know, make a little love...
Well, get down tonight.
I don't know. I don't...
I don't get it! Two months ago,
Rachel and I were this close.
Now I'm taking messages from guys
taking down my messages, you know?
Or Rachel and I should be together...
...and we should get
some kind of message service.
Hang in there.
It's gonna happen.
Now, how do you know that?
Because she's your lobster.
Oh, she's going somewhere.
It's a known fact that lobsters
see old lobster couples...
...walking around their tank,
holding claws, like...
You have to picture lobsters.
Hey, you feeling better?
Yeah, I think that fifth shower
got the interview off me.
Do you have other possibilities?
There is the possibility
I can lend you money.
If I couldn't pay you back right away,
I'd feel guilty and tense around you.
Then why not borrow it
from Mom and Dad?
You feel guilty and tense
make some money off of them.
The man's got a point.
What is that sparkly thing?
That thing?
Yeah, it's a little flashy.
No, no.
No, no. It's not flashy.
Not for a goodfella.
Man, that is sharp! That must
have cost you quite a few doubloons.
No, it's fun, it's fun. It's kinda like
we have a surprise for you.
We're turning your room into a gym.
Wow, that is a surprise!
Just one question.
Why not Ross's room?
We talked about that...
...but your brother had so many
science trophies, plaques, merit badges...
We didn't want to disturb them.
God forbid!
So what's new with you?
- My job? Well...
Did I mention I still
don't have a boyfriend?
Well, I just assumed.
We were so sorry to hear
about your parents splitting up.
Well, they're just separated.

They've been unhappy
ever since we've known them.
Especially after

What? What incident?
No, no. I must be

I want to get this just right.
Dude, eleven o'clock,

I'm Gail.
I really have to go,
but it was nice meeting you.
Excellent!
He could have gotten me a VCR
or a set of golf clubs.
But no! He got me
the Liberace House of Crap!
- It's not bad.
- Easy for you to say.
You're not sporting a reject
from the Mr. T collection!
"I pity the fool that
doing some impressions.
Do your Marcel Marceau.
That's actually good.
Would you look at that guy?
How long has he
been talking to her?
I don't know. A couple of minutes.
Yeah? Try doubling that.
It's like, back off, buddy!
She's a waitress, not a geisha.
I think she's okay.
Look at that!
She pushes him away
Ski in, ski out, it's great.
Excuse me? Are you Rachel?
What?
Ross Geller.
God, in your ad you said
you were pretty, but wow!
What are you doing?
Oh, my God, is this the wrong day?
I don't believe it!
If it works out, we'll have
something to tell the grandkids!
You sure will.
I've gotta go.
Take care.
See you later.
You're welcome.
- What?
conversation with an interesting man?
From where I was...
Okay, Ross, listen to me.
I am not yours to save.
But you are.
What?
You're my lobster.
Are you being
the blind-date guy again?
No, you're my lobster.
Lobsters...
In the tank, when they're old...
...they get with the...
They walk around holding the claws.
In the tank!
with the lobster thing?
Do the claws again.
Rach, forget the lobsters, okay?
Let's talk...
What about us?
Ross, there is no "us," okay?
No! Listen to me!
I fell for you and I get clobbered.
You then fall for me
and I again get clobbered.
I'm tired of being
Accept that.
Except that what?
No. No.
Accept that.
I gotta go.
Hey, man! Look, it's my best bud!
How you doing?
You're getting good at that
Marcel Marceau thing.
What do you say we play some ball?
you should have just said so.
Doesn't the fact that I wore it...
...say how much
our friendship means to me?
But you insulted the bracelet
and you made fun of me.
Well, that's the part
wouldn't focus on that.
Oh, yeah? Well focus on this.
Hard to argue with that.
Come on, man! I said I was
sorry a hundred times.
I promise, I will never
take it off my...
...wrist.
But if you want to

Much like they did
in biblical times.
Though you may haveth anger now...
You're gonna grab yourself again,
aren't you?
You know, that Steffi Graf
It's right there!
Hey, guys.
Hi, darling.
You didn't bring my grandson?
He's at Carol and Susan's today.
A woman in my office is a lesbian.
I'm just saying!
Jack, look! There's that house
paint commercial that cracks you up!
- Where have you been?
- Emotional hell.
Did they lend you the money?
No, I haven't asked them yet.
Come on, Monica, do it.
Hey, you guys.
Monica has some news.
So listen, I'm sorry I didn't
I had to leave it.
Why?
Because they made me.
You were fired?
What are you gonna do?
Judy, relax. This is our little
Harmonica we're talking about.
We taught her well.
- Ten percent of your paycheck goes?
That's what it's there for.
She's gonna be fine.
- Aren't you, sweetie?
- In the bank.
If you need a little extra...
...you know where to find it.
Anything larger back there?
I can't believe it!
Would you stop already?
Get out of the bitter barn
and play in the hay.
Oh, you're right.
a bracelet I hated to begin with.
Bring on the hay!
Hey!
I've got something
that'll make you happy.
Guess what Gunther found?
Hey, now you have two!
Oh, now you have two.
What am I gonna do?
How come you have two?
This one's for you.
Get out!
No, I can't.
I know how much this means to you...
...and this is about more than jewelry.
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're "best buds."
Is this friendship?
We're bracelet buddies!
That's what they'll call us!
Okay, here you go.
Pay me back whenever you like.
You have dinosaur checks?
You get your money
and you learn something.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
Hey, you're a cheap-a-saurus!
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
I was a little bigger then.
I thought they used that
to cover Connecticut when it rains.
Hey, what's on this videotape?
I don't know.
Let's put it in.
Oh, my God!
What is with your nose?
They had to reduce it
what they use to cover Connecticut.
This is us getting ready
for the prom.
We don't have to watch.
Yeah, we do.

{}{}..."God, I hope they get together."
{}{}Okay, wait.
{}{}You know what?
{}{}Ross, let's switch places.|You get in the middle.
{}{}You could come in straddling him,|they still wouldn't believe it.
{}{}We're here!
{}{}- Hi, kids!|- The children!
{}{}Happy birthday!
{}{}So you kids thanked|Dr. Burke for the ride?
{}{}Actually, Mom, I think Monica|thanked him for the both of us.
{}{}No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
{}{}Speaking of whom...
{}{}...I hear he's got some|-year-old twinkie in the city.
{}{}Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.
{}{}So Richard's shopping|in the junior section?
{}{}Are we still on that?
{}{}She's probably not even pretty.
{}{}Just young enough so that|everything is still pointing up.
{}{}{y:i}Can you believe this place?
{}{}In the bathroom there's mirrors|on both sides of you.
{}{}When you're in there, it's like|peeing with the Rockettes.
{}{}Well, there's my fantasy come true.
{}{}We were just saying, great apartment!
{}{}Thanks. You want it?
{}{}I'm moving to a bigger place.
{}{}Can you see me in a place like this?
{}{}Why not? You hate park views|and high ceilings?
{}{}Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.
{}{}On TV.
{}{}Stop talking. Okay!
{}{}- Come on, tell us!|- Is she really ?
{}{}Come on, it's my birthday.|Let me live vicariously!
{}{}Dad, you really don't want to do that.
{}{}What's a little midlife crisis|between friends?
{}{}I know what you're going through.|When I turned , I got the Porsche.
{}{}You got your own little speedster.
{}{}- Seriously, it's not like that.|- Tell you what.
{}{}Dad, I beg you not|to finish that sentence!
{}{}What? I'm kidding!
{}{}You know I'd never let him|touch the Porsche.
{}{}Which lily?|This lily or that lily?
{}{}- Well, I...|- I like this lily.
{}{}It's more open|and that's like my mom.
{}{}Foghorn Leghorn!
{}{}Blonde girl?|You're in room two.
{}{}Not-so-blonde girl, you're with me.
{}{}You're not going.
{}{}Is this because of what Ross said?
{}{}- Well, yeah, maybe.|- I don't believe this.
{}{}Come on, what is this, ?
{}{}What's ?
{}{}Just, you know, a long time ago.
{}{}Then there was suffrage, which was|a good thing. But it sounds horrible.
{}{}Do you want this tattoo?
{}{}Yes, I do.|It's just that Ross...
{}{}Who is the boss of you?
{}{}You?
{}{}You are the boss of you!
{}{}Go!
{}{}How you doing?
{}{}I'm a twinkie!
{}{}This is so hard.
{}{}Yeah, I know. I hate it too.
{}{}Look, maybe we should just tell them.
{}{}My parents are dead.
{}{}God, you are so lucky!
{}{}I mean...|Well, you know what I mean.
{}{}Okay, I'll go out first, all right?
{}{}Judy! Going to the bathroom.|Good for you!
{}{}Thank you, Richard.|I appreciate the support.
{}{}Seen my Harmon Killebrew bat?|Bob doesn't believe I have one.
{}{}I have no idea.
{}{}Did you know Richard|has a twinkie in the city?
{}{}I just never would have|pictured Richard with a bimbo.
{}{}He told Johnny Shapiro|that she's quite a girl.
{}{}He told Johnny that he thinks|he's falling in love with her.
{}{}So, Jack...
{}{}...ever think about trading me in|for a younger model?
{}{}Of course not.
{}{}Oh, Jack, stop!
{}{}Come on!
{}{}It's my birthday!
{}{}I am not interested|in the guy's apartment.
{}{}Oh, please. I saw the way|you were checking out his moldings.
{}{}You want it.
{}{}I've already got|an apartment that I love.
{}{}It wouldn't kill you|to say it once in a while.
{}{}All right. You want the truth?|I'm thinking about it.
{}{}I'm . I've never lived alone...
{}{}...and I'm at a place|where I got enough money...
{}{}...that I don't need a roommate.
{}{}I can afford to live here by myself.
{}{}I may have to bring in somebody|once a week to lick the silverware.
{}{}Why are you getting|so bent out of shape?
{}{}We're not Bert and Ernie.
{}{}You know what?
{}{}If this is the way you feel...
{}{}- That's how I feel.|- Then maybe you should take it!
{}{}Maybe I will!
{}{}- Fine with me!|- Great!
{}{}...the spoons!
{}{}Whose drink can I freshen?
{}{}Almost time for cake!
{}{}You remember that video|I found of Mom and Dad?
{}{}Well, I just caught the live show.
{}{}- Hey, there.|- What?
{}{}Really?
{}{}- Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?|- Not that I know of.
{}{}I was thinking, why doesn't|he give Monica a call?
{}{}Well, actually,|I'm already seeing someone.
{}{}Oh?
{}{}She never tells us anything.
{}{}Mom, there are|so many people in my life.
{}{}Some are seeing people|and some aren't.
{}{}Is that crystal?
{}{}Well, he's a doctor.
{}{}A real doctor?
{}{}No, a doctor of meat.
{}{}And he's handsome.
{}{}And he's sweet,|and I know you'd like him.
{}{}Well, that's wonderful.
{}{}It is, Judy.
{}{}Jack!
{}{}Could you come in here for a moment?
{}{}- Found it!|- I'll take that, Dad.
{}{}It seems your daughter and Richard|are something of an item.
{}{}That's impossible.|He's got a twinkie in the city.
{}{}- You're the twinkie?|- She's not a twinkie!
{}{}Look, this is the best relationship|I've been in...
{}{}Oh, please! A relationship?
{}{}For your information,|I'm crazy about this man.
{}{}Really?
{}{}Am I supposed to stand here|and listen to this on my birthday?
{}{}When did I say that?
{}{}Upstairs in the bathroom,|right before you felt up Mom!
{}{}{y:i}Happy birthday to you
{}{}{yi}Happy birthday, dear Jack
{}{}It looks so good!|Oh, I love it.
{}{}Okay, let me see yours.
{}{}Let's see yours again.
{}{}We just saw mine.|Let me see yours.
{}{}It's gone! That's so weird.
{}{}I don't know how, where it went.
{}{}You didn't get it?
{}{}I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
{}{}How could you do this to me?|This was your idea!
{}{}I know! I was gonna get it,|but he came in with this needle.
{}{}Really? You don't say?
{}{}Because mine was licked on by kittens!
{}{}I'm sorry about what...
{}{}Do we need to hug?
{}{}No, we're all right.
{}{}So I got you something.
{}{}- Great!|- Lick away, my man!
{}{}These will go great in my new place|till I get real ones.
{}{}What?
{}{}No, I mean what's this|about your new place?
{}{}I'm moving out,|like we talked about.
{}{}I didn't think that was serious.
{}{}Well, it was a fight...
{}{}...based on serious stuff, remember?
{}{}About how I never|lived alone or anything?
{}{}...or whatever.
{}{}Well, there you go.
{}{}Hey, are you cool with this?
{}{}I've never been lower or wetter.
{}{}I'll be fine.|I'll just turn your...
{}{}...bedroom into a game room.
{}{}Why do you get to keep the table?
{}{}I did pay for half of it.
{}{}I paid for the other half.
{}{}All right, you're on.
{}{}I can take two minutes|out of my day to kick your ass.
{}{}Your men will get scored on|more times than your sister.
{}{}So are you sorry that I told them?
{}{}No. It's been a long time|since your dad and I went running.
{}{}Did you get it?
{}{}Okay, really quick.
{}{}That's great!
{}{}Very tasteful.
{}{}What? You didn't get one.
{}{}Okay. Well then, what is this?
{}{}What are we looking at?
{}{}That's my tattoo.
{}{}That is not a tattoo.|That is a nothing.
{}{}I got her in the chair...
{}{}Okay, hi!
{}{}For your information,|this is exactly what I wanted.
{}{}This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen|from a great, great distance.
{}{}Oh, what a load of crap!
{}{}That is a dot!
{}{}Your mother's in heaven going,|"Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"
{}{}You got a tattoo?
{}{}Maybe.
{}{}But just a little one.|Phoebe got the whole world!
{}{}Well?
{}{}Well, it's really...
{}{}...sexy.
{}{}...wow!
{}{}Really?
{}{}So is it sore?|Or can you do stuff?
{}{}Save us some pizza.
{}{}Get it out of the corner!
{}{}Pass it! Pass it!
{}{}And the table is mine.
{}{}Congratulations.
{}{}You guys will still|come visit me, right?
{}{}We'll be over there all the time.
{}{}Except when we are here.
{}{}I know you're just moving uptown,|but I'll really miss you.
{}{}Who's gonna eat all of our food|and tie up our phone lines...
{}{}Is that my bra?
{}{}- What are you doing with my bra?|- It's not what you think.
{}{}Remember? Those kids couldn't|even get theirs across the street.
{}{}Yeah, I remember.
{}{}Let's bring the rest of these|down to the truck.
{}{}...give you a hand|with the foosball table?
{}{}You keep it.|You need the practice.
{}{}Thanks.
{}{}...I guess this is it.
{}{}Yeah, right.
{}{}I guess so.
{}{}I'm guessing tonight|at the coffeehouse.
{}{}Right. Yeah. Okay.
{}{}Take care.
{}{}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! D
{}{}So what do you think?
{}{}{yi}Casa de Joey.
{}{}Wow, Joey, this is...
{}{}- Art.|- Art it is.
{}{}Check this out!|Is it a coffee table?
{}{}Hey, nice pillow.
{}{}So tell me,|is this genuine Muppet skin?
{}{}Hey, excellent water, table thing.
{}{}It makes me want to pee.
{}{}Yeah, me too.|I think that's the challenge.
{}{}How come Chandler didn't come?
{}{}...with the thing.
{}{}Right. I got it.
{}{}So why don't you show us|the rest of your "casa"?
{}{}Nice toilet.
{}{}No, no, no. Behind it.
{}{}- You have a phone in here?|- That's right.
{}{}In here.
{}{}Joey, promise me something.
{}{}Never call me from that phone.
{}{}English Subtitles by|GELULA & CO., INC.
{}{}Okay, here we go.
{}{}Sorry, they were all out of apple pie.|Someone just got the last piece.
{}{}I have just been discovered.
{}{}Wait a minute. I claimed you|in the name of France four years ago.
{}{}Anyway.
{}{}I just met this producer|of this teeny record company...
{}{}...who said that I have|a very fresh, offbeat sound...
{}{}...and she wants to do|a demo of "Smelly Cat".
{}{}And she wants to do a video.
{}{}I'm not done yet, okay?
{}{}God!
{}{}I'm done now.
{}{}If you care about me,|get the pie out of the man's hood.
{}{}- Get the what?|- There's a pie in the hood. Go!
{}{}I'm sorry.|My pie was in your hood.
{}{}I have to get the coffee|out of that guy's pants...
{}{}...and I'll be back|in the hospital by .
{}{}Calm down. I'm blow-drying.
{}{}Blow-drying what?|You have no hair.
{}{}What's going on?
{}{}It's like I'm living with him again.
{}{}He's here when I go to sleep and|wake up and when I want to shower.
{}{}I feel like I'm  again.
{}{}Get out, you doofus!
{}{}Or, you know,|he's rubber and you're glue.
{}{}All yours.
{}{}Shut up!
{}{}Cut it out!
{}{}I've never wanted you more.
{}{}You know what they say
{}{}Ask your slippers a question...
{}{}...you're going crazy.
{}{}That's okay.
{}{}You had a thing.
{}{}I hear the place looks great.
{}{}How's the apartment?
{}{}It's terrific.|I mean, it's a regular space...
{}{}...- fest!
{}{}{yi}Yeah, I just...
{}{}...wanted to call and say hey.
{}{}Well, okay.
{}{}That's right, my friend.
{}{}{yi}... Baywatch!
{}{}I can't believe|they made her lieutenant!
{}{}You're saying that because|you love Yasmine Bleeth.
{}{}How could anyone|not love Yasmine Bleeth?
{}{}See, this is the|brilliance of the show.
{}{}I say always keep them running.
{}{}All the time running!
{}{}Run!
{}{}Run, Yasmine! Run like the wind!
{}{}But you wanted to live by yourself.
{}{}I figured I'd have time alone|with my thoughts.
{}{}But it turns out I don't have|as many thoughts as you think.
{}{}Why don't you talk to Chandler|about moving back?
{}{}We had a good talk last night...
{}{}...but when I moved out,|I hurt him bad.
{}{}He would definitely want you back.
{}{}But we had one of the greatest talks|we ever had last night.
{}{}I mean, it was...
{}{}It was like when we first|started living together.
{}{}...but we've seen him|in his new place. And he's happy.
{}{}He's decorated.
{}{}Chandler, he has moved on, okay?|You have to, too.
{}{}You're not...
{}{}...roommates anymore.
{}{}Okay, Phoebe.|You ready to try one?
{}{}{yi}What are they feeding you?
{}{}Whoa! Oh, my God!
{}{}They're your backup singers.|Behind you, hon.
{}{}I thought they were just watching me.
{}{}Like at an aquarium, you know?
{}{}From the top.
{}{}{y:i}What are they feeding you?
{}{}I'm just not getting...
{}{}...that everyone gets...
{}{}...how smelly|this cat actually is.
{}{}...because I need to feel|that you really care about the cat.
{}{}We can talk.
{}{}It's just that this costs|$  a minute to be in here.
{}{}No, there is no way|he was a velociraptor.
{}{}Look at the cranial ridge, okay?
{}{}If Dino was a velociraptor,|he'd have eaten the Flintstones.
{}{}I was.
{}{}Tony, can you hold on?|That's the other line.
{}{}Yeah, she's here,|but can she call you back?
{}{}Call Joanna.
{}{}Did she leave a number?
{}{}Did you see me write one down?
{}{}She'll call back.|Don't be such a baby.
{}{}You're the baby.
{}{}- Get off my back.|- Get out of my face.
{}{}Yeah, she's right here.|Hold on.
{}{}Tony, can I call you back?
{}{}That's my sister's boyfriend.
{}{}Sweetie, before I forget, did I|leave my diaphragm at your place?
{}{}Hi, Mom.
{}{}So how's the palace?
{}{}What's with the boxes?
{}{}Actually, I have some news.
{}{}Is that Joey guy gonna pick up|his moose hat or should I toss it?
{}{}Nice to meet you.
{}{}- Likewise.|- How you doing?
{}{}I'll take that.
{}{}This is new.|Where'd you two meet?
{}{}At the supermarket|in the ethnic food section.
{}{}I helped him pick out a chorizo.
{}{}Now it's a spare room?
{}{}Well, yeah.|In that it's not being used...
{}{}...and I have it to spare.
{}{}I'll see you.
{}{}Hey, Joe.
{}{}When'd you start using|moose in your hair?
{}{}Yeah, he is.
{}{}I can't believe he has|a new roommate. Who is he?
{}{}Eddie. He just met him.
{}{}Check it out! Check it out!
{}{}It's "Smelly Cat", the video!
{}{}Now, I haven't seen it yet,|so if you don't like it...
{}{}Get out of here, cat! You stink!
{}{}Smoking!
{}{}Look at me!
{}{}{yi}What are they feeding you?
{}{}{y:i}It's not your fault
{}{}{yi}It's not your fault
{}{}- Oh, my God!|- I know.
{}{}{yi}They won't take you to the vet
{}{}{yi}Smelly cat, smelly cat
{}{}I've never heard myself sing before.
{}{}I mean, except in my own head.
{}{}This is so cool!|Now I can hear what you hear!
{}{}I am sorry,|but I'm incredibly talented!
{}{}{y:i}It's not your fault
{}{}Eddie.
{}{}Morning.
{}{}I just came by to pick up my mail.
{}{}You don't keep it|on this table anymore?
{}{}Eddie likes it over there.
{}{}All right, here you go, my friend.|Eggs á la Eddie.
{}{}What?
{}{}I thought you liked your eggs...
{}{}...with the bread with the hole|in the middle, á la me!
{}{}Well, you guys...
{}{}...I'm out of here.
{}{}See you, pals.
{}{}- How are you two getting along?|- I couldn't be happier.
{}{}Great.
{}{}I'm happy for you.
{}{}He just comes in here,|Mr. Johnny New Eggs...
{}{}...with his moving the mail|and his "See you, pals".
{}{}And now there's no juice!
{}{}There's another carton there.
{}{}This isn't about juice anymore,|all right, man?
{}{}All right.
{}{}Eggs!
{}{}Whose eggs do you like better,|his or mine?
{}{}- Well, I like both eggs equally.|- Oh, come on!
{}{}What's the difference?|Your eggs aren't here anymore.
{}{}You took your eggs and you left!
{}{}Did you expect me|to never find new eggs?
{}{}Tough. We're watching|{yi}Predators of the Serengeti.
{}{}Would you guys stop!
{}{}It's my TV!
{}{}Monica keeps changing the channel.
{}{}That's great.|Why don't you tell Mommy on me?
{}{}Now I'm Mommy in this little play?
{}{}...this weird little Geller|dimension thing, okay?
{}{}So I'm gonna go take|a nice long hot bubble bath...
{}{}...because you kids|are driving me crazy!
{}{}We could tape "Entertainment Tonight".
{}{}Not that!
{}{}This! Us!
{}{}Since you've been here,|you're driving me...
{}{}Mon, you've gone ultrasonic|again, all right?
{}{}I just can't stand you being here...
{}{}Why? Why can't you|stand me being here?
{}{}We're just having fun.
{}{}Fun? You think this is fun?
{}{}I hated you when we were kids!
{}{}You hated me when we were kids?
{}{}I hated you.
{}{}...but basically, I hated your guts.
{}{}Why did you hate me?
{}{}Because you were mean to me...
{}{}That wasn't fun for you?
{}{}I can't believe you hated me.
{}{}But now I love you.
{}{}Really?
{}{}You're just gonna have|to stop pissing me off.
{}{}I can do that.
{}{}So you wanna watch|"Entertainment Tonight"?
{}{}Thanks.
{}{}You know what?
{}{}Listen, you are not|going to believe this...
{}{}...but that is not me|singing on the video.
{}{}How did you find out?
{}{}...for someone else to sing for me.|That was my first clue.
{}{}What will you do?
{}{}I can't work with people|who would do this.
{}{}I mean, this poor woman.
{}{}What woman?
{}{}The voice woman.
{}{}Okay, Pheebs, but what about you?
{}{}I have a video. Pay attention.
{}{}This voice woman, she's so talented.
{}{}She's like one of those|animals at the pound...
{}{}...who nobody wants|because they're not pretty.
{}{}Or you know, like some old dog|who's kind of like stinky and...
{}{}That song has so many levels.
{}{}Hey, Eddie.
{}{}You wanna play some foosball?
{}{}Yeah, okay. All right.
{}{}Doesn't matter.|Time for "Baywatch"!
{}{}You like that show?
{}{}It's just pretty people|running around on the beach.
{}{}That's the brilliance of it.
{}{}The pretty people.
{}{}I'm gonna go read in my room|for a little while.
{}{}Okay, man.
{}{}{y:i}I think of all the friends I've known
{}{}{yi}No one's home
{}{}{y:i}Don't wanna live
{}{}{yi}Anymore
{}{}{yi}Smelly cat, smelly cat
{}{}{yi}Smelly cat, smelly cat
{}{}{y:i}They won't take you to the vet
{}{}{yi}You may not be a bed of roses
{}{}Ross, those are the only lines we have.|Back to the chorus!
{}{}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! D
{}{}{yi}It's like Brad to have|{yi}to have the last word.
{}{}We wanna see the end.
{}{}{y:i}I know you do.
{}{}{yi}What?
{}{}{y:i}I'm actually your half-brother.
{}{}I get the medical award|for separating the Siamese twins.
{}{}Then Amber and I go to Venezuela|to meet our other half-brother, Ramon...
{}{}...where I find the world's|biggest emerald. It's really big.
{}{}So cool!
{}{}God, that is good TV!
{}{}The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies
{}{}Pheebs, play with me!
{}{}This game is grotesque!
{}{}Twenty armless guys joined|at the waist by a steel bar...
{}{}Hello? Human rights violation!
{}{}Don't feel so bad.|After playing...
{}{}...I break out the plastic women|and everybody has a good time.
{}{}He's not a big fan of foosball.
{}{}Are we not getting along|with the new boy?
{}{}No, he's all right. He spends|most of his time in his room.
{}{}Let's remedy that, shall we?
{}{}- We don't need to.|- It'll be fun!
{}{}What was that?
{}{}All right.
{}{}Oh, good! Okay.
{}{}Oh, no! I have to go,|because I'm late for...
{}{}Tonight, it's "Why he would not|eat them on a train."
{}{}- Have fun! Bye!|- That was so lame.
{}{}I know.
{}{}So you think that "Speed Racer" guy|gets a lot of tickets or...?
{}{}That's good.|So who broke up with who?
{}{}I broke up with her.
{}{}When everybody knows that|the capital of Cambodia is...
{}{}It's not Sean Penn.
{}{}I got a funny one.
{}{}I made these pancakes.|Like,  pancakes.
{}{}All of a sudden,|she turns to me and says, "Eddie...
{}{}...I don't wanna see you anymore."
{}{}...ripped out my heart|and smeared it all over my life!
{}{}There was this incredible abyss|and I'm falling.
{}{}I keep falling and|I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!
{}{}{yi}And a crusty old man|{yi}Said I'll do what I can
{}{}That's it! Thanks! Good night.
{}{}Great set tonight, Pheebs.
{}{}I know.
{}{}We should get going.
{}{}You know how we always stay|at your apartment?
{}{}I thought tonight|we'd stay at my place.
{}{}I don't know.|I don't have my jammies.
{}{}My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
{}{}Shut up. I'm happy.
{}{}Oh, this is so nice!|I have to make a speech.
{}{}...I like you the best.
{}{}Thank you, Pheebs.|That's very sweet.
{}{}You hear that?
{}{}Not a lot.
{}{}Phoebe's kidding. Phoebe's crazy.
{}{}Phoebe's dead.
{}{}He's not here right now.|I'm Chandler.
{}{}Can I take a message or...|Or a fish tank?
{}{}Thanks.
{}{}I'm Tilly.
{}{}I gather by that "Oh",|he told you about me.
{}{}Yeah, your name came up...
{}{}He's kind of intense.
{}{}Yes! Hey, can I ask you,|is Eddie a little...
{}{}A little what?
{}{}Come on in, you roomie!
{}{}Hello, Tilly.
{}{}Eddie, I just came by|to drop off your tank.
{}{}It's very thoughtful.
{}{}Well, okay then.
{}{}I'm gonna go. Bye.
{}{}You had sex with her.
{}{}Check it out, check it out!
{}{}"Soap Opera Digest"!|That's one of my favorite digests!
{}{}"New Doc on the Block,|'Days of our Lives' Joey Tribbiani."
{}{}Cool picture!
{}{}Oh, I look good.
{}{}Well, kind of, yeah.
{}{}Remember last week|when Alex was in the accident?
{}{}The line in the script was...
{}{}But I made it, "If this woman|doesn't get to a hospital...
{}{}...she's not gonna live."
{}{}Oh, okay.|I see what you did there.
{}{}I never thought about the writers.|The scripts just come to my house.
{}{}But you know what?
{}{}This makes me look good,|which makes the show look good...
{}{}{yi}Makes up most of his lines.
{}{}{y:i}Write this, jerk-weed.
{}{}What does this mean?|I fall down an elevator shaft?
{}{}I don't know.|I just bring the scripts.
{}{}They can't kill me!|I'm Francesca's long-lost son!
{}{}Could you sign?
{}{}No! No way! I'm not signing that!
{}{}I don't think that will affect|the plot of the show.
{}{}All right, I'm just gonna go.
{}{}Sorry.
{}{}Well, it wasn't that many guys.
{}{}...it's a very small percentage.
{}{}It's not that big a deal.|I was just curious.
{}{}- Good night.|- Good night, Richard.
{}{}Before I tell you, you tell me|how many women you've been with.
{}{}Two.
{}{}Two? Two?
{}{}...have you seen you?
{}{}I mean, what can I say?
{}{}I was married to Barbara for  years,|my high-school sweetheart.
{}{}Two it is.
{}{}Time for bed.|I'm gonna brush my teeth.
{}{}No, wait a minute now!
{}{}Oh, come on!
{}{}You know, I don't need the|actual number. Just a ballpark.
{}{}Okay, it is definitely|less than a ballpark.
{}{}Tell me about it.
{}{}So what's your magic number?
{}{}Come on, you know everyone|I've been with. All both of them.
{}{}Better not be doing these in order.
{}{}Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny.
{}{}Barry.
{}{}Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.
{}{}Honey, are you jealous of Paolo?
{}{}I'm so much happier with you|than I ever was with him.
{}{}That Paolo thing was|barely a relationship.
{}{}All it really was|was just meaningless, animal sex.
{}{}Okay, you know, that sounded|so much better in my head.
{}{}That's exactly what someone|who slept with her would say.
{}{}This is nuts! Crazy!|She came over for two minutes...
{}{}...dropped off a fish tank and left!
{}{}Buddy?
{}{}My fish, Buddy.
{}{}There was no fish|when she dropped it off.
{}{}You sleep with my ex-girlfriend,|insult my intelligence by lying...
{}{}...then you kill my fish?|My Buddy?
{}{}I didn't kill your fish!
{}{}Would you look at what I'm doing?
{}{}Now that can't be smart.
{}{}So we're just gonna|take this guy right off you...
{}{}Tangelo?
{}{}That's it? That's the giant number|you were afraid to tell me?
{}{}Well, that's not bad at all.
{}{}You're okay with it?
{}{}Oh, honey, I'm fine.
{}{}Okay, about that two.
{}{}All right.
{}{}What about my two?
{}{}It just seems like|a really small number.
{}{}Don't you have a lot|of wild oats to sow?
{}{}Or is that what you're doing with me?|Oh, my God! Am I an oat?
{}{}Honey, you are not an oat.
{}{}I've only slept with women I love.
{}{}You've only slept with two people.
{}{}Right.
{}{}Now I do.
{}{}Ross, please listen to me.
{}{}You are so much better for me|than Paolo ever was.
{}{}If I make you laugh, here's an idea.
{}{}Invite Paolo to have|a romp in the sack...
{}{}...and I'll stand in the corner|and tell knock-knock jokes!
{}{}"Animal sex"?
{}{}So what are you saying?
{}{}There's nothing between us|"animal" at all?
{}{}Not even, like...
{}{}...chipmunk sex?
{}{}Try to hear me, okay?
{}{}- It was good with Paolo.|- Knock-knock.
{}{}But what you and I have|is so much better.
{}{}We have tenderness,|we have intimacy, we connect.
{}{}This is the best...
{}{}...I have ever had.
{}{}Until now.
{}{}- Oh, my God!|- I know!
{}{}Honey, that's great!
{}{}I know!
{}{}- Hurry.|- Why? You need one too?
{}{}Found them!
{}{}There's only one.
{}{}- They're trying to decide something.|- Good. Good, good.
{}{}So was your mustache...|Did it used to be different?
{}{}How do you, you know,|keep it so neat?
{}{}- What is that?|- A mustache comb.
{}{}Thank you.
{}{}Okay, I will do your laundry|for one month.
{}{}I will clean the apartment|for two months.
{}{}I'll give this to you now, if you|tell me where we keep the dustpan.
{}{}So were you in Nam?
{}{}One, two, three.
{}{}Yes!
{}{}Fine. Go have sex.
{}{}John Savage was "Deer Hunter",|no legs.
{}{}Jon Voight was "Coming Home",|couldn't feel his legs.
{}{}You've got it totally the other way|around, my friend. Jon Voight...
{}{}Shall we?
{}{}It's not gonna happen.
{}{}They're doing it tonight.|We can do it tomorrow.
{}{}So when I woke up this morning...
{}{}...he'd stolen all the insoles|out of my shoes!
{}{}Why?
{}{}Why would you kill his fish?
{}{}Because sometimes|after you sleep with someone...
{}{}...you have to kill a fish.
{}{}...I'm sorry.
{}{}Can we watch Joey's show now, please?
{}{}Wait. He's not here yet.
{}{}I'm fine about my problem now,|by the way.
{}{}{y:i}... I'll always be there for you...
{}{}{yi}Oh, Drake.
{}{}First the medical award, now this?
{}{}{yi}Dr. Ramoray, report to|{yi}first floor Emergency stat.
{}{}Well, then...
{}{}...I guess that's me.
{}{}They only said you.
{}{}Oh, okay. All right.
{}{}I love you.
{}{}Oh, no!
{}{}Drake, look out!
{}{}- Did they just kill off Joey?|- No!
{}{}Come on! Open up!|We want to talk to you!
{}{}I don't feel like talking!
{}{}Come on! We care about you.
{}{}I'm sorry, Joey.
{}{}Listen, sorry about your death.|That really sucks.
{}{}- We came over as soon as we saw.|- How could you not tell us?
{}{}Well, maybe they could find|a way to bring you back.
{}{}They said that when they found my body,|my brain was so smashed in...
{}{}...that the only doctor|who could've saved me was me.
{}{}But Joey, you're gonna be fine.
{}{}You don't need that show.|It was just a dumb soap opera.
{}{}This was the greatest thing|that ever happened to me.
{}{}Here's Monica.|She'll have something nice to say.
{}{}I straightened out your shower curtain|so you won't get mildew.
{}{}What? To me, that's nice.
{}{}No, I don't.
{}{}It's like you work|your whole life for something...
{}{}...and you think|that when you get it...
{}{}But this so was.
{}{}It changed everything.
{}{}Like, the other day,|I got this credit card application...
{}{}I've never been pre-approved|for anything in my life!
{}{}I'm sorry, man.
{}{}I don't know if this'll mean|anything to you...
{}{}That means nothing to me.
{}{}Pecan sandy? Just made them.
{}{}Yeah, all right.
{}{}Sure, why not?
{}{}Listen, Eddie.
{}{}I've been thinking about|our living situation.
{}{}I got a little surprise.|Look. There's a new fishy.
{}{}I named him...
{}{}...Chandler, you know, after you.
{}{}No, that's a Goldfish cracker.
{}{}So what's your point, man?
{}{}Okay, good night.
{}{}- Brisk tonight.|- Oh, man.
{}{}- Let's never speak of this.|- You got it.
{}{}Ripped with SubRip . and Verified by CdinT|cdint@hotmail.com
{}{}Hey, Eddie.
{}{}- What are you doing here?|- Watching you sleep.
{}{}Why?
{}{}Please.
{}{}I can't sleep now!
{}{}You want me to sing?
{}{}What are you talking about?
{}{}Hannibal Lecter?
{}{}Better roommate than you.
{}{}What about the other nights|when you don't see me?
{}{}Last night you went|and got some water...
{}{}...and I was nice enough|to hide behind the door.
{}{}Get out now!
{}{}You really want me out?
{}{}Yes, please.
{}{}I want you out.
{}{}I want to hear it from your lips.
{}{}Where'd you hear it before?
{}{}I'll be out by the time|you get home from work tomorrow.
{}{}The One Where Eddie Won't Go
{}{}Well, look at you!
{}{}Finally got that|time machine working, huh?
{}{}You like it?
{}{}..."You know what I don't have?"
{}{}A mirror?
{}{}Fine, make fun.|I think it's jaunty.
{}{}I'll be all right.|I'm not starting from square one.
{}{}I was Dr. Drake Ramoray|on "Days of our Lives".
{}{}That's got to have some kind of cachet.
{}{}Chandler gave me|word-of-the-day toilet paper.
{}{}I'm gonna get some coffee.
{}{}So? Did you read the book?
{}{}Didn't it, like,|totally speak to you?
{}{}What book is this?
{}{}You have to read this book.|It's called "Be Your Own Wind Keeper".
{}{}But there's wind.
{}{}And the wind can make us goddesses.
{}{}Do you know who takes our wind?|Men. They just take it.
{}{}All the time. Because they|are the lightning-bearers.
{}{}That sounds kind of cool.|It's like "The Hobbit".
{}{}It is nothing like "The Hobbit".
{}{}Except for Richard.
{}{}Richard would never steal your wind.
{}{}Because he's yummy.
{}{}And the part about how|they're always drinking...
{}{}...from our pool of inner power.
{}{}But God forbid we should take a sip.
{}{}This is a typical|lightning-bearer thing.
{}{}It's like...
{}{}..."Hello. Who wants one of|my phallic-shaped man-cakes?"
{}{}You're not mad at me|for getting fired and everything?
{}{}Look at me.
{}{}Look at me!
{}{}Can we get back to me?
{}{}Look, honey. People get fired|left and right in this business.
{}{}I already got you an audition|for "Another World".
{}{}"Cab Driver Number "?
{}{}You're welcome.
{}{}But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!
{}{}Things change. Roll with them.
{}{}But this is a two-line part!
{}{}It's like taking a step backwards.
{}{}I'm gonna tell you the same thing|I told Al Minza...
{}{}...and his pyramid of dogs.
{}{}Take any job you can get,|and don't make on the floor.
{}{}I'll see you.
{}{}God!
{}{}Oh, God!|I mean, it's just so...
{}{}This is like reading|about my own life!
{}{}This book could have been called|"Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel"!
{}{}It wouldn't have sold|a million copies...
{}{}Sweetie, we've got to go.
{}{}No! Why do we always have to do|everything according to your timetable?
{}{}Actually, it's the movie theater|that has the timetable.
{}{}This isn't about the movie theater.|This is about you stealing my wind.
{}{}You go, girl!
{}{}I can't pull that off, can I?
{}{}Yes, my wind.
{}{}How do you expect me to grow|if you won't let me blow?
{}{}You know I don't...
{}{}I just really need to be|with myself right now.
{}{}I'm sorry.
{}{}You're right.|I don't have to apologize.
{}{}- What is it?|- I don't know.
{}{}It's got all this stuff|about wind and trees...
{}{}...and some sacred pool.
{}{}This is why I don't date|women who read.
{}{}What's that?
{}{}It's my VIS A bill.
{}{}- That can't be good.|- Open it, open it.
{}{}Oh, my God!
{}{}Look at this!|How did I spend so much money?
{}{}Thirty-five hundred dollars|at "Porcelain Safari"?
{}{}My animals.
{}{}The guy said they suited me. He spoke|with an accent. I was confused.
{}{}You can start by driving a cab|on "Another World".
{}{}- What?|- That audition?
{}{}That's a two-line part!
{}{}- So what?|- So suck it up, man.
{}{}It's a job. It's money.
{}{}I don't need you getting judgmental|and condescending and pedantic.
{}{}I'm not being any of those things.|I'm being realistic.
{}{}You're supposed to be my friend!
{}{}I am your friend.
{}{}And "Something big's gonna|come along. I know it!"
{}{}But I don't know it.
{}{}What I do know is you owe $ |at "Isn't It Chromantic?"
{}{}Then get some sense.|It took you  years to get that job.
{}{}- How long till you get another?|- I don't want to hear this!
{}{}I'm just saying...
{}{}Maybe I should just go.
{}{}I'll see you later.
{}{}Just think about it.
{}{}I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!
{}{}That was huge!
{}{}Big things are gonna happen!|You'll see!
{}{}You still there?
{}{}What are you still doing here?
{}{}Just some basic dehydrating|of fruits and vegetables.
{}{}Aren't you forgetting anything?
{}{}Oh, yeah. I got us a new goldfish.
{}{}He's feistier than the last one.
{}{}Eddie, isn't there something|you're supposed to be doing now?
{}{}Not unless it's got something|to do with dehydrating.
{}{}Because right now,|I'm a dehydrating maniac!
{}{}You know what that is?
{}{}Your last roommate's kidney?
{}{}That's a tomato.
{}{}Hey, Gunther.|Let me get a lemonade to go.
{}{}Lemonade?
{}{}You okay, man?
{}{}They killed off|my character on the show.
{}{}That's too bad.|How'd they do it?
{}{}I fell down an elevator shaft.
{}{}I was buried in an avalanche.
{}{}What?
{}{}I used to be Brice|on "All My Children".
{}{}There'll be no more|watching me sleep! No more...
{}{}...watching!
{}{}I got some great stuff to dehydrate.|Grapes, apricots.
{}{}Get out.|Get out, get out, get out!
{}{}- What?|- You! Move out!
{}{}Take your fruit!|Your stupid small fruit and get out!
{}{}I gotta tell you, that's kind of|out of the blue, don't you think?
{}{}This is not out of the blue!
{}{}This is smack-dab|in the middle of the blue!
{}{}You don't have to tell me twice.
{}{}Someone will be by for my stuff.
{}{}If you think I'm leaving you|alone with my fish, you're insane!
{}{}No help required, "chico"!
{}{}All the way to the airport, huh?|You know, that's over  miles.
{}{}That's gonna cost you about so bucks.
{}{}Five-O dollars.
{}{}You know what it is?|It's smudgy because they're fax pages.
{}{}When I was on "Days of our Lives"|as Dr. Drake Ramoray...
{}{}That's great.
{}{}If you wanted to expand this scene,|like have the cab crash...
{}{}...I could attend to the victims...
{}{}Okay, listen, thanks for coming in.
{}{}Don't thank me for coming in.|At least let me finish.
{}{}We could take the expressway...
{}{}You were going for bridge there,|weren't you?
{}{}I'll have a good day.
{}{}Question number .
{}{}I would have to say no.
{}{}And I would have to say...
{}{}What?
{}{}You totally let him wash his feet|in the pool of your inner power.
{}{}And his puppet too!
{}{}Well, at least|I didn't let some guy...
{}{}- Who?|- Paul!
{}{}Moving on, moving on.|Next question.
{}{}Okay, number .
{}{}...for a lightning-bearer?"|Okay, number .
{}{}Whoa, whoa, whoa!|Let's go back to .
{}{}Not to my recollection.
{}{}You know the bottle|was pointing at me.
{}{}Only because you took up|half the circle!
{}{}Listen to you two.|It's so sad.
{}{}Not when they find out|you slept with Jason Hurley...
{}{}...an hour after|he broke up with Monica.
{}{}One hour?
{}{}Be careful with that -D "Last Supper".|Judas is a little loose.
{}{}Oh, my God! What's going on?
{}{}They're taking all my stuff back.|I guess you were right.
{}{}I was totally hung up|on my own stuff the other day.
{}{}No, listen. I need the whole|security thing, you know?
{}{}To know where my next paycheck is|coming from. But you don't need that.
{}{}I could never do what you do.
{}{}- Thanks.|- You hold out for something bigger.
{}{}I can't tell you|how much respect I have...
{}{}- I went.|- Great! How did it go?
{}{}- I didn't get it.|- Good for you!
{}{}You're living the dream!
{}{}Not my parrot.
{}{}I can't watch this.
{}{}Hey, hold on, hold on.
{}{}- Twelve hundred.|- Dollars?
{}{}You spent $  on a plastic bird?
{}{}It was an impulse buy.|Near the register.
{}{}Do you have anything for around $ ?
{}{}The dog.
{}{}I'll take it.
{}{}Thanks, Ross!
{}{}I really liked that bird, though.
{}{}But the dog!
{}{}We didn't order cake.
{}{}No, I know. They're from me.
{}{}You guys, this is not good.
{}{}...without taking it from each other.
{}{}You're right.
{}{}I love you goddesses.
{}{}- Thank you. So are we good?|- We're good.
{}{}We're good?
{}{}Let me take these back.|They'll take it out of my paycheck.
{}{}Are you sure this time?
{}{}I actually saw him leave.
{}{}That guy is holding a human head.
{}{}Check it out, man!
{}{}I tore it off a mannequin|in the alley behind Macy's.
{}{}There's no alley behind Macy's.
{}{}It'll make a hell of a conversation|piece at our next cocktail party.
{}{}"Our next cocktail party"?
{}{}We'll put chips in it.|We'll make it a chip chick.
{}{}Yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
{}{}Do you remember|talking to me yesterday?
{}{}So what happened?
{}{}Oh, sweet Moses!
{}{}So on this road trip,|did you win any money?
{}{}I crapped out. But Mr.  here!|He cleans up!
{}{}Nice.
{}{}See you upstairs. See you, pals!
{}{}Is anyone else starting|to really like him?
{}{}Why doesn't my key work,|and what's my stuff doing downstairs?
{}{}I'm sorry.
{}{}Have we met?
{}{}I'm sorry...
{}{}...I already have a roommate.
{}{}He's lived here for years.|I don't know what you're talking about.
{}{}Well, I think we'd remember|something like that.
{}{}I know I would.
{}{}That's a good point.
{}{}I guess I got the wrong apartment.
{}{}- I'm terribly sorry.|- Hey, no problem.
{}{}See you.
{}{}- You want me to help you unpack?|- Nah, I'm okay.
{}{}Just so you know, I'm not|moving back in because I have to.
{}{}I mean, I do have to, but...
{}{}I mean, this is...
{}{}Welcome home, man.
{}{}- A little foos?|- Absolutely!
{}{}It's a cantaloupe.
{}{}Are we gonna bring this out|every time Ross comes over?
{}{}He paid a lot of money for it.
{}{}If you hated it so much,|why'd you buy it in the first place?
{}{}Well, I had a whole ceramic|zoo thing going over there.
{}{}But without the other ones,|it looks tacky.
{}{}Stay.
{}{}Stay!
{}{}Good fake dog.
{}{}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! D
{}{}- What you guys doing?|- Monica's making us watch "Old Yeller".
{}{}Why are you guys upset?|It's "Old Yeller". It's a happy movie.
{}{}Come on. Happy family gets a dog.
{}{}Frontier fun!
{}{}Pheebs, what about the end?
{}{}That's not the end.
{}{}That's when my mother would|shut off the TV and say, "The end".
{}{}What about when he has rabies?
{}{}That's what my mom said.
{}{}I don't think she'd want you|to see what's about to happen.
{}{}Why? What's about to happen?
{}{}Hey, Travis, what you doing|with that gun?
{}{}Oh, no.
{}{}No, no, Travis, put down the gun.
{}{}No! The end! The end!
{}{}Okay, what kind of a sick|doggy snuff film is this?
{}{}The One Where Old Yeller Dies
{}{}Have you guys eaten? Richard and I|just finished, and we've got leftovers.
{}{}Chicken and potatoes.
{}{}What am I wearing?
{}{}One of these times, you'll really|be naked and we won't come over.
{}{}I got a leg, three breasts|and a wing.
{}{}How do you find clothes that fit?
{}{}All right, yes, I see other women|in the shower at the gym.
{}{}And no, I don't look.
{}{}No, not that one.
{}{}Ross can't go, so it's between my friend|Eric Prower, who has breath issues...
{}{}...and Dan, with the poking.|"Did you see that play?"
{}{}"You want more beer?|Is that Spike Lee?"
{}{}Richard, if you had an extra|ticket to the Nicks game...
{}{}...and you had to choose between|a friend who smelled...
{}{}...and one who bruises you,|who would you pick?
{}{}...I think you should take someone|who's a huge Nicks fan.
{}{}That's Eric.
{}{}Glad to be of help.|Matches.
{}{}What?
{}{}- I don't know.|- Come on!
{}{}He keeps his fingers to himself,|and he's always minty fresh.
{}{}Plus, he's old...
{}{}- er than some people.
{}{}But younger than some buildings.
{}{}He's important to me.
{}{}If you ask him,|he might take you in his Jag.
{}{}How do we say yes...
{}{}Okay, this could be tough.
{}{}We'll bring him,|but only if he takes the Jaguar.
{}{}You almost had it.
{}{}Hi, honey.
{}{}You are not gonna believe|what happened!
{}{}We were playing on the floor,|and he grabs the table...
{}{}He pulled himself up!
{}{}Standing man!
{}{}I'm sorry you missed it,|but I did tape it if you wanna see it.
{}{}You can watch our tape if you want.
{}{}See, I don't believe this.|I missed the first time of everything.
{}{}The first time he rolled over,|the first time he crawled.
{}{}Does he have a favorite liqueur?
{}{}He is getting closer|on the talking thing.
{}{}He can't quite say "mama" yet,|but once he said "Yemen".
{}{}I want him for more than a day.|I want him for a whole weekend.
{}{}Listen. I feel...
{}{}That would be great.
{}{}Oh, shoot, that would've been fun.
{}{}Did you just see that?
{}{}Did you see? He just waved!|He just waved!
{}{}Yes, he has. Very good.
{}{}What you got there?
{}{}{y:i}Love Story, Brian's Song and|{y:i}Terms of Endearment.
{}{}I talked to my grandma|about the "Old Yeller" incident...
{}{}...and she said my mom used to not|show us the ends of sad movies...
{}{}...to shield us from|the pain and sadness.
{}{}Where's Richard?|Did you ditch him?
{}{}After we stole his lunch money|and gave him a wedgie.
{}{}What's the matter?|He's parking the car.
{}{}He let us drive his Jaguar.|Joey for  blocks. Me for .
{}{}He must like you best.
{}{}What about when he tipped the guy|who showed us to our seats?
{}{}Hey, Chandler, thanks for|showing us to our seats.
{}{}You're welcome. Hey, Joey,|thanks for parking the car.
{}{}No problem.
{}{}There's the man!
{}{}Hey, you're getting better.
{}{}I'm gonna keep this.
{}{}Your first weekend without Ben.|What are you doing?
{}{}We're going to|colonial Williamsburg.
{}{}A woman I went to college with is|the first female blacksmith there.
{}{}Look, I better go|before Mommy starts weeping.
{}{}- We love you.|- Bye, Mommy.
{}{}Have a good time.
{}{}Joey, do you know|we can see you from here?
{}{}How come Richard looks cooler|with one of these?
{}{}You may wanna light it|and lose the spatula.
{}{}Not like him, per se.
{}{}Just not unlike him.
{}{}It's the artist formerly known|as Chandler.
{}{}Why didn't you grow a mustache?
{}{}We flipped for it.
{}{}I got the cigar,|he got the mustache.
{}{}You really sidestepped|that land mine.
{}{}I promised Richard|we'd meet him downstairs.
{}{}You're meeting Richard?
{}{}He said he was going out with the guys.|I didn't know that was you.
{}{}You hear that?
{}{}We're the guys!
{}{}Thank you!
{}{}Hi. We're visiting.
{}{}It's Ben and his dada.
{}{}I'm telling your mommies you said it,|so you might as well.
{}{}No luck, huh?
{}{}A while ago,|I got a "seh" out of him...
{}{}Would you hold him for a sec?|I gotta take this off.
{}{}Sure. Okay.
{}{}What are you doing?
{}{}He's a baby, not a bomb.
{}{}Hold him like you'd hold a football.
{}{}This is how I would hold a football.
{}{}Sorry, I'm not very good with babies.|I haven't been around them.
{}{}I mean, you know, since I was one.
{}{}- It's all right. No big deal.|- Really?
{}{}- What?|- What?
{}{}You think about stuff like that?
{}{}Yeah. I mean...
{}{}Two babies?
{}{}You know, a boy and a girl.
{}{}Hopefully, the girl will come first,|so Ben won't feel competitive.
{}{}We won't wanna raise kids in the city,|so we'll move to Scarsdale.
{}{}We'll be far enough from our parents|so we don't have to see them...
{}{}...but close enough|that they can baby-sit.
{}{}...but the school system's great.
{}{}Wow, that's great! Great!
{}{}Okay, wow! You know what?
{}{}Here. You take this.
{}{}I'm gonna go pour these|very nice people some coffee.
{}{}Look at that. I don't have a pot.
{}{}Or in Scarsdale.|Hey, is that a door?
{}{}Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?
{}{}Murder, cancer, soccer teams eating|each other in the Andes.
{}{}What is happening to the world?
{}{}I mean...|No, no, because E.T. Leaves...
{}{}...and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.
{}{}With the web. The spider.
{}{}She dies. She has babies and dies.
{}{}It's like, "Welcome home|from the hospital." Thud!
{}{}Here. Watch this.
{}{}So you can't lose.|It's there in the title.
{}{}I fell for that with|{yi}Pride of the Yankees.
{}{}I thought I'd see a film|about Yankee pride.
{}{}And boom! The guy gets|Lou Gehrig's disease.
{}{}Watch that. It'll restore|all your faith in humanity.
{}{}Hey, big guy. Game time.
{}{}- Hey! Be right there!|- There's a game?
{}{}Bring your nerves of steel.
{}{}It's the basketball playoffs.
{}{}I appreciate this, but you don't|have to hang out with them for me.
{}{}Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.
{}{}I like hanging out with them.|They're different than my other friends.
{}{}They don't start sentences with|"You know who just died shoveling snow?"
{}{}Go Nicks!
{}{}It's the college playoffs.
{}{}- Then, go Vassar!|- They're not in it.
{}{}Why does this bother me so much?
{}{}I'm not one of those people who wants|to spend  hours a day together.
{}{}Sure.
{}{}Does it matter? You'll just die|or divorce or blow your pet's head off.
{}{}Me too!
{}{}Rachel, I got a question. Richard|made plans again with the guys...
{}{}I'm gonna go read "Cosmo".|Maybe there's something helpful in it.
{}{}If not, I can learn how to do a bikini|wax with leftover Christmas candles.
{}{}What happened back there?
{}{}One minute I'm holding Ben,|then I've got two kids...
{}{}...I'm living in Scarsdale|complaining about taxes!
{}{}Well, I'm sorry.|I think about stuff.
{}{}You've planned out the next  years.|We've dated for six weeks!
{}{}You never think about our future?
{}{}I think about whose apartment|we'll sleep at tomorrow...
{}{}I do not think about|our children's names!
{}{}You know what our|children's names will be?
{}{}No, I mean, you know. I read a book,|and there was a girl named Emily.
{}{}What book?
{}{}Okay, listen.
{}{}But I do not want|everything decided for me!
{}{}I spent my whole life like that.
{}{}It's what I had with Barry.|That's a reason I left.
{}{}Sorry if that scares you, but if you|wanna be with me, deal with that!
{}{}- Okay, fine!|- Thank you!
{}{}- We're not done!|- I didn't know that.
{}{}He knows we'll end up together.
{}{}If that scares you, tough!|You'll have to deal with that.
{}{}- I will!|- Good, because I love you!
{}{}- That's the first time we've said that!|- Yes, it is!
{}{}- I'm gonna kiss you!|- You better!
{}{}Thanks for the great movie tip.
{}{}I don't know if I was happier when|George Bailey destroyed the business...
{}{}...or Donna Reed cried or when|the pharmacist made his ear bleed.
{}{}I'll give you the ear thing,|but wasn't the ending wonderful?
{}{}It kept getting worse!|It should've been called
{}{}"It's a Sucky Life, And Just When You|Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!"
{}{}Kick, save! And...
{}{}He gets it back.|Pass to the middle, lines it up...
{}{}Yes!
{}{}Could that shot be any prettier?
{}{}We had a table in college.
{}{}Really? I didn't know they had|foosball in the s.
{}{}Nice mustache. At puberty,|that thing will really kick in.
{}{}One more point.
{}{}Score!
{}{}Now can we go?
{}{}Is everything all right?
{}{}Don't be mad at him.|It's our fault.
{}{}I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.
{}{}- Well...|- No, seriously.
{}{}We just talked about this.|He is so much cooler than our dads.
{}{}Our dads are okay and all,|but Richard is just...
{}{}I'm trying to talk here.
{}{}You guys see me as a dad?
{}{}- Oh, yeah!|- No!
{}{}When we say "dad", we mean "buddy".
{}{}We mean "pal".
{}{}No, seriously. Joey's my dad.
{}{}I've even got some dads down at work.
{}{}That's fine.
{}{}Well, your other dad and I are gonna|go have a romantic evening.
{}{}Nighty-night.
{}{}You're not a dad!
{}{}I can't believe you got us|into trouble.
{}{}Just...
{}{}...I feel like I'm about a hundred.
{}{}I thought I was just one of the guys.
{}{}I'll make you feel like|one of the guys.
{}{}For a really cool guy,|you suck at foosball.
{}{}I was killing them.
{}{}You take the poopy diaper|and put it in the poopy diaper pail.
{}{}Calling it a "poopy diaper"|doesn't make this process any cuter.
{}{}{y:i}- It's us.|- Come on up.
{}{}Okay, we can do this now,|can't we, Ben?
{}{}Yes, we can.
{}{}Yes, we can.
{}{}I did it!
{}{}Look at that!
{}{}It stays on and everything.
{}{}Oh, my God! Ross?|Ben just said hi!
{}{}- What?|- Ben just said hi!
{}{}What, the word "hi"?
{}{}Great! And I missed that too.|I miss everything!
{}{}Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just|bring it out in him.
{}{}- Where is he?|- We missed you.
{}{}Guess what?|Ben just said his first word.
{}{}What did he say?
{}{}Something about hi.
{}{}You know, actually,|it's more like, hi!
{}{}This could go on for a while.
{}{}You're right.|We've got a cab waiting.
{}{}We should do it again sometime, Ben.|What do you say?
{}{}- All right, so I've got him...?|- Tuesday.
{}{}Bye, you guys.
{}{}Did he just say "bye"?
{}{}He said bye!
{}{}You said bye!|He said bye to me!
{}{}Suddenly I'm seeing him|go off to college!
{}{}We've gotta go.|We've got that cab downstairs.
{}{}See you later.
{}{}{yi}... isn't this a nice hole here?
{}{}Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries|Bert in the sand and can't find him.
{}{}Now, I've looked ahead on the tape,|and he does find him again.
{}{}But I think we can handle it.
{}{}And there's just the alphabet,|but we know that ends well, so...
{}{}Here we go.
{}{}{yi}What happened to my friend Bert?|{yi}He was here just a moment ago.
{}{}I'm so glad you're here.

{}{}But when it does, it's exciting.
{}{}Dad says he knows someone|you can call for an interview.
{}{}Right there! That's the third|sign today. Right there.
{}{}On behalf of everyone,|I'd just like to say, "Huh?"
{}{}...I keep getting signs|telling me to go see my father.
{}{}Like when I was walking over here|and I passed a buffet.
{}{}Which is my father's last name.
{}{}...which is his first name|minus the "s" at the end.
{}{}And there was a rotisserie|with a spinning chicken.
{}{}His Indian name?
{}{}...when I tried to meet him.|So coincidences? I don't think so.

{}{}You wanna forget racquetball|and hang out?
{}{}- Hey, you're in our seats.|- Sorry, we didn't know.
{}{}We were sitting there.
{}{}Okay.|There is one more way to say it.
{}{}- Was that supposed to be funny?|- Actually, I was going for colorful.
{}{}- What's with this guy?|- What's with you?
{}{}Nothing. Nothing's with him.
{}{}What just happened?
{}{}I just took your hat.|See, I can be funny too.
{}{}My joke is that I took your hat.
{}{}Can I have it back?
{}{}You know what?|I think you're very funny.
{}{}Kudos on that hat joke.
{}{}Why should we?
{}{}Because it's a special hat.
{}{}He bought it because|he was feeling down one day.
{}{}...to cheer himself up, you know?
{}{}- Chandler...|- Stop talking. Stop talking now.
{}{}Let me get this straight.|You're stealing my hat?
{}{}I just want to make sure|we're on the same page.
{}{}How'd the interview go?
{}{}It bit.
{}{}I'd have to cook in a costume|and dance on the counter.
{}{}I was a sous chef|at "Café des Artistes".
{}{}How can I take a job where I have|to make Laverne-and-Curly Fries?
{}{}I have $  in the bank!
{}{}Monica, relax. Go get a beer.
{}{}I don't want a beer.
{}{}What's the matter?
{}{}Some mean guys at the coffeehouse|took my hat.
{}{}- No!|- You're kidding?
{}{}Actual bullies.
{}{}We're grownups. This kind of stuff|isn't supposed to happen anymore.
{}{}Oh, no, wait a minute.|I have no one.
{}{}Forget it. It's probably stripped|and sold for parts by now.
{}{}- I went up!|- What?
{}{}My stock, MEG, it went up two points.
{}{}...that I'd, like, have|a lot more than that today.
{}{}You know what?|I'm going to do it.
{}{}- Do what?|- Put all my money in me.
{}{}What's to know?|Buy, sell. High, low. Bears, bulls.
{}{}Yes, Manhattan.
{}{}Telephone number for the stock...
{}{}See? I told you these pillows|would be a good idea.
{}{}Oh, God.
{}{}Here we go.
{}{}- We love you. We're here for you.|- Good luck.
{}{}Thanks.
{}{}Hey, Rach, you want some sandwich?
{}{}Olive loaf and ham spread. No mayo.
{}{}No, because mayo,|that would make it gross.
{}{}- Run, Phoebe, run!|- No, no, doggy, please!
{}{}- You got a bone?|- Are you kidding?
{}{}Look, kibbles! Bits!
{}{}Get the hell off my leg,|you yippity piece of crap!
{}{}Why don't you take his trampoline?
{}{}Okay, here, I know what we can do.
{}{}Okay, doggy, get the sandwich!
{}{}The dog will lick himself|but he will not touch your sandwich.
{}{}What does that tell you?
{}{}- Lf he's not going to eat it, I will.|- Are you crazy?
{}{}- Hey.|- What?
{}{}Do you have to be a Century |real-estate agent...
{}{}...to get to wear those cool jackets?
{}{}Isn't that the guy|who used to wear your hat?
{}{}And look where they're sitting.
{}{}You're joking, right?|You guys just walked through the door.
{}{}This couch belongs to us.
{}{}I'll tell you what,|you call the couch...
{}{}...and then we'll call the couch...
{}{}You know, I keep wondering|why you two are still sitting here.
{}{}All right, that's it.
{}{}I have had enough of this.
{}{}These guys are trying|to take our seat.
{}{}Fellas, these guys were here first.
{}{}Oh, sorry, didn't realize.
{}{}Thank you, Gunther.
{}{}We didn't want to have|to go and do that.
{}{}He told on us?
{}{}Well, pal, you didn't|give me much of a choice.
{}{}- Don't play with his thing.|- I know.
{}{}All right.
{}{}"Let's take this outside?"
{}{}Who talks like that?
{}{}The guy who's about to kick your ass|talks like that.
{}{}Okay, okay, look. See...
{}{}...the thing is, we're not gonna|fight you guys.
{}{}Here's the deal.
{}{}I think you played|the Gunther card too soon.
{}{}Hey, Pheebs, I think you're good to go.
{}{}Yeah, I don't know.
{}{}I just think that this was|a really bad sign.
{}{}Like the beast at the threshold.
{}{}It's just I have no family left,|except for my grandmother.
{}{}Despite what she says.
{}{}And I have a sister who I've barely|spoken to since we shared a womb.
{}{}I don't know. This is my real father...
{}{}I completely understand.
{}{}Whatever you need.
{}{}Hey, you want to go home?
{}{}What was that?
{}{}I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
{}{}I want to buy five shares of SGJ.|Now.
{}{}Thank you!
{}{}"Time is money, my friend?"
{}{}You missed|"Takes money to make money"...
{}{}I made $  before breakfast.|What have you done?
{}{}I had breakfast here,|so technically I saved $..
{}{}How did you make $ ?
{}{}...I split my money and I bought|some shares of CHP and ZXY.
{}{}How come those?
{}{}Well, CHP because I used to have a|crush on Erik Estrada.
{}{}What happened to MEG?
{}{}MEG was good for me, but I dumped her.
{}{}My motto is, "Get out|before they go down."
{}{}How's the dog?
{}{}Okay. I talked to the vet.|People are so nice upstate.
{}{}He said the little fella's gonna be|okay, and I can get him tomorrow.
{}{}But he did have to have|a bunch of stitches.
{}{}And he said that only once in a blue|moon does a dog's ear grow back.
{}{}So still hoping.
{}{}I don't want to meet my father|over the phone.
{}{}What will I say,|"Hi, I'm the daughter you abandoned."
{}{}"Oh, by the way, I broke your dog."
{}{}Listen, just don't say anything|about me, okay?
{}{}Don't...
{}{}...be too long with the phone.
{}{}It's a woman.
{}{}So talk to her.
{}{}Hello, Mrs. Buffay.
{}{}I want you to know he'll be returned|to you almost as good as new...
{}{}...within  hours.
{}{}Goodbye.
{}{}Your cappuccino, sir.
{}{}Thank you.
{}{}- This is better than the coffeehouse.|- Absolutely.
{}{}The package says to keep it moving.
{}{}Stir and drink, never let it settle.
{}{}This is ridiculous.
{}{}...I'll go to the coffeehouse with you|and we'll have a cup of coffee.
{}{}No problem. Joey's there.
{}{}I don't want to have to have Joey with|me every time I want decent coffee.
{}{}I say you and I go|and stand up to those guys.
{}{}All right, hang on|a second there, Custer.
{}{}Ross, have you ever|been beaten up before?
{}{}By someone besides Monica?
{}{}So what?
{}{}So we get beaten up. Maybe that's|something a man has to go through.
{}{}Couldn't we just lose|our virginities again?
{}{}Because I think actually|mine's growing back.
{}{}- I need $ .|- What?
{}{}- I need $ .|- For what?
{}{}- To get back in the game.|- When did you get out?
{}{}I lost it all. I lost it.
{}{}Look, Mon, I'm really sorry.
{}{}Where are we on the $ ?
{}{}I don't have it.
{}{}Otherwise, I'll have to|take that diner job.
{}{}You know, with the dancing|and the costumes.
{}{}I don't want to have to wear|flame-retardant boobs.
{}{}Noodle!
{}{}Oh, my God. What the hell|happened to my dog?
{}{}It was an accident.
{}{}She's a vegetarian.
{}{}Are these stitches?
{}{}Yeah, eight of them.|That's  to him.
{}{}...because that cone|will fill up fast.
{}{}Thanks for bringing back|what's left of him.
{}{}- Is Frank home?|- How do you know Frank?
{}{}What?
{}{}I mean Frank Senior.
{}{}He went out for groceries.
{}{}He left four years ago.|We're expecting him back any minute.
{}{}I'm gonna go.
{}{}I'm sorry about the dog.|Everything.
{}{}Hey, lady!
{}{}Hey, wait up!
{}{}- How do you know my dad?|- Well, I don't really.
{}{}He's kind of my dad too.
{}{}Heavy.
{}{}So did he ever talk about me... Phoebe?
{}{}Except stilts.
{}{}- Stilts?|- Yeah, he loved stilts.
{}{}One time, I was upstairs stealing|cigarettes out of my mom's purse...
{}{}...and there's Dad's head,|bobbing past the window.
{}{}He just had this big smile on his face|and he was waving...
{}{}...because he was happiest|when he was on his stilts.
{}{}Me neither.
{}{}So are you, like, my big sister?
{}{}This is huge. You can buy me beer!
{}{}But you know what's cool? If you had|a friend named Pete, I could say...
{}{}..."I know Pete.|He's friends with my brother."
{}{}- I got a friend named Mark.|- That'll work too.
{}{}So maybe, you know,|I could give you a call sometime.
{}{}We could talk or something.
{}{}- Yeah, that'd be okay.|- All right.
{}{}So stilts, huh?
{}{}If you want, I can show you where|he hit his head on the rain gutter.
{}{}We did it. We're here.|We are standing our ground.
{}{}Thank you.
{}{}- There we go.|- I think we proved our point.
{}{}- You burn your mouth?|- Cannot feel my tongue.
{}{}Look who's here.|It's the weenies.
{}{}Did we not make ourselves clear|the other day?
{}{}That's why we're here.
{}{}Apparently.
{}{}Let's do this already.
{}{}You got a weapon?
{}{}All right, let's do this.
{}{}- What do you mean?|- It's sharp, it's metal.
{}{}No, you can't use your watch.
{}{}Or your keys.
{}{}Here's what we'll do.
{}{}All right?
{}{}All right, come on, man. Let's do it!
{}{}Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
{}{}I have to work on Monday.|I have a big presentation.
{}{}Actually, I gotta show|this apartment tomorrow...
{}{}...and this no-faces thing|might not be a bad idea.
{}{}Or the waist down.
{}{}- Dana's ovulating.|- Really? You guys trying again?
{}{}Let me get this straight.|We're talking about the middle?
{}{}You want a piece of this?|I'm standing here!
{}{}Those guys are taking our stuff!
{}{}God, that was amazing.|That was incredible.
{}{}You really gave it to|old Mr. Clean back there.
{}{}- He was a big guy.|- Yeah, he was, wasn't he?
{}{}I wouldn't know,|having missed everything.
{}{}Any one of us could have tripped|over that little girl's jump rope.
{}{}So listen, guys...
{}{}...are we okay here?
{}{}So can I have my hat back?
{}{}Oh, my God. Look at her.
{}{}Hi, Monica!
{}{}Hey, nice boobs.
{}{}Guys, guys. Check this out.
{}{}Excellent.
{}{}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! D
{}{}I'll get candles and|my mom's lace tablecloth.
{}{}And since it's Rachel's birthday...
{}{}What?
{}{}Question. Why do we always|have parties where you poach things?
{}{}You want to be on the food committee?
{}{}Why can't we just get pizza|and beer and have fun?
{}{}I agree. Fancy parties are only fun|if you're fancy on the inside.
{}{}And I'm not sure we are.
{}{}Fine. You can throw|any kind of party you want.
{}{}Joey, they're not real!
{}{}I start miles beneath the surface|of these things. They're fake.
{}{}Wow, it's like porno for clowns!
{}{}The One With Two Parties
{}{}English Subtitles by|GELULA & CO., INC.
{}{}I still have to invite Dylan|and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
{}{}No Shannon Cooper.
{}{}Why not her?
{}{}She steals stuff.
{}{}Or maybe she doesn't and Joey slept|with her and never called her back.
{}{}Joey, that is horrible.
{}{}Maybe too much.
{}{}I don't know.
{}{}I guess I just got scared.
{}{}I didn't think anyone|would buy that. Okay!
{}{}Hi, honey.|How did it go?
{}{}It was the graduation from hell.
{}{}It's supposed to be a joyous occasion.
{}{}Nobody thought my sister|would graduate from college.
{}{}It's a testament to what a girl|from Long Island will do for a Celica.
{}{}My parents happened.
{}{}All they had to do was sit|in the same stadium, smile...
{}{}...and not talk about the divorce.|But no!
{}{}Bishop Tutu actually|had to stop and shush them.
{}{}You know the good news?
{}{}I get to serve coffee|for the next eight hours.
{}{}- How about just her mom?|- Why her mom?
{}{}Because I already invited her.
{}{}Did you ask Stacy Roth?
{}{}She also steals.
{}{}Here are the candles.|Where's the birthday cake?
{}{}We're not having birthday cake.
{}{}Excuse me?
{}{}It's a traditional|Mexican custard dessert.
{}{}That's nice.
{}{}Dr. Greene!
{}{}Oh, my God!|It's Rachel's dad.
{}{}Why are you here?
{}{}No, no, the father can.
{}{}But since I am the roommate,|I can tell you she's not here.
{}{}And I'll pass along the message.|Okay? So bye-bye.
{}{}No, no, not a party.
{}{}Just a surprise gathering|of some people Rachel knows.
{}{}- This is Phoebe, Chandler and Joey.|- I'll never remember all that.
{}{}Rachel comes home, people pop out|and yell stuff? Is that it?
{}{}This isn't your first|surprise party, is it, sir?
{}{}Hi, Monica.
{}{}So basically, just a Chinese guy.
{}{}Dr. Greene, come with me.|We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
{}{}All right.|That sounds like a two-person job.
{}{}Sandra, I thought you were Rachel.|We weren't ready for you yet.
{}{}- You thought I was Rachel?|- Yes, because you look so young.
{}{}And because you're both,|you know, white women.
{}{}- No, I'll take that for you.|- Oh, well, thank you.
{}{}Such a gentleman.|Thank you.
{}{}It all looks so nice.|So festive. All the balloons.
{}{}- I was driving...|- That's great!
{}{}I can't wait to hear the rest,|but I have to go to the bathroom.
{}{}Hey, come with me.
{}{}You know, like at a restaurant.|It'll be fun! Come on.
{}{}Oh, my God. Oh, my God.|Oh, my God!
{}{}Think. Think.
{}{}Okay, now that your coat|is safely in the bed...
{}{}We can come back out|in the living room.
{}{}Joey and Chandler, it's time|you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
{}{}Why, again?
{}{}Because that's where|the party is, you goon!
{}{}- See, this is just the staging area.|- Right, it's the staging area.
{}{}All right, you guys are off|to party number one.
{}{}And you...
{}{}You are off to party number two.
{}{}At least send some women to my party.
{}{}Okay, that's Ross. All right.
{}{}Okay, they're coming.
{}{}Thanks for being born.
{}{}Thank you for my beautiful earrings.|They're perfect.
{}{}I love you.
{}{}Now I love you even more.
{}{}Surprise!
{}{}Oh, my gosh!
{}{}Oh, my God. Mom!
{}{}This is so great!
{}{}Happy birthday, sweetie.
{}{}- Really?|- No, I knew.
{}{}All right.
{}{}There's food and drinks on the table.
{}{}- Why?|- Just go.
{}{}Weird.
{}{}Surprise!
{}{}Daddy!
{}{}Both of them are here? Both of them?|Both of them are here?
{}{}Well, we could count again?
{}{}You know, this is ridiculous.
{}{}This is your birthday, your party.
{}{}Let's put them together.|If they can't deal with it, who cares?
{}{}Are you gonna be okay?
{}{}I don't really have a choice.|I can look at the bright side.
{}{}I get two birthday parties|and two birthday cakes.
{}{}...just one birthday flan.
{}{}It's a traditional|Mexican custard dessert.
{}{}Talk to Monica.|She's on the food committee.
{}{}...and stuck her tongue|down my throat.
{}{}I love this party!
{}{}- Quick volleyball question.|- Volleyball.
{}{}You didn't like|that gray lamp, did you?
{}{}A woman stuck her|tongue down my throat.
{}{}I'm not even listening to you.
{}{}Can you keep Dad occupied?|I'm gonna talk to Mom for a while.
{}{}Do you have any ideas|for any openers?
{}{}Stay clear of "I'm the guy|that's doing your daughter"...
{}{}I want you to take a piece of paper...
{}{}Here you go. And write down|your most embarrassing memory.
{}{}When you're not using the markers,|put the caps back on them...
{}{}Hi, Dr. Greene.
{}{}So how's everything in the...
{}{}...vascular surgery...
{}{}It's not a game, Ross.|A woman died on my table today.
{}{}I'm sorry.
{}{}That's the good thing about my job.
{}{}Listen, I don't mean|to be a pain about this...
{}{}...but I've noticed some of you|are just placing them on.
{}{}You want to push the caps...
{}{}Gunther!
{}{}Where you going?
{}{}I was sort of thinking about maybe...
{}{}We're just starting.|Here's your marker.
{}{}If you want to go, just go.
{}{}She'll yell at me again.
{}{}What?
{}{}In a minute, I'll create a diversion.
{}{}When I do, walk quickly to the door|and don't look back.
{}{}- What do you want?|- Scotch.
{}{}I'll be back in  seconds with|your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
{}{}Neat!
{}{}Neat, as in no rocks.
{}{}I know.
{}{}Hello, Ross!|Where have you been?
{}{}Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
{}{}Scotch neat.
{}{}That's Rachel's father's drink.
{}{}Scotch neat.
{}{}Would you excuse me?
{}{}Where are you sneaking off to, mister?
{}{}No.
{}{}What do you mean "no"?
{}{}See, because that's the staging area.
{}{}Take your scotch back in there...
{}{}...and I will get|your cigarettes for you, sir.
{}{}- Get my glasses too.|- All righty-roo.
{}{}Okay, the first person's|most embarrassing memory is...
{}{}..."Monica, your party sucks."
{}{}Very funny.
{}{}What?
{}{}I don't see anything.
{}{}Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
{}{}Mine.
{}{}You wear bifocals?
{}{}I have a condition apparently...
{}{}...two different sets of focals.
{}{}Do you know my husband|has glasses just like that?
{}{}Well, those are very popular frames.
{}{}I hear you can get people out of here.
{}{}You didn't tell me|your boyfriend smokes.
{}{}Yeah, like a chimney.
{}{}Big, big smoker.
{}{}In fact, I'm gonna go into the hallway|and fire up this bad boy.
{}{}Are you wearing my glasses?
{}{}I was just warming up|the earpieces for you.
{}{}Thank you.
{}{}Is that one of my cigarettes?
{}{}She's taking the trash out,|so I can get you out of here.
{}{}But it has to be now.|She'll be back any minute.
{}{}What about my friend?
{}{}- Let me just get my coat.|- There isn't time!
{}{}Just leave everything.
{}{}They'll take care of you next door.
{}{}Everything you've heard is true.
{}{}Could you guys please keep it down?
{}{}We're trying to start|a Boggle tournament.
{}{}And you.
{}{}You're supposed to be at my party.
{}{}And Gunther!
{}{}Welcome to the fo...
{}{}All right, I'm sorry.|But these people needed me.
{}{}They work hard all week.|It's Saturday night.
{}{}You know, my party is fun.
{}{}It's a little quieter,|less obvious sort of fun.
{}{}But if people would just|give it a chance, it's...
{}{}You've chosen a boyfriend|exactly like your father.
{}{}Okay, Mom, I'll make an appointment.
{}{}But right now, I gotta go.|I gotta go do a thing.
{}{}I felt like Gulliver.
{}{}Daddy, I really want|to hear more about this...
{}{}...but I just have to do some stuff.
{}{}...but all he cares about|is his stupid boat.
{}{}You work and you work|and you work on a boat.
{}{}He always ridiculed my pottery classes.
{}{}But when all is said and done,|he still drinks out of the mugs.
{}{}{y:i}- The scotch, the cigarettes...|{y:i}- The bonsais and the Chihuahua...
{}{}{yi}What the hell does she want|{yi}with half a boat?
{}{}Okay, okay, you can be shirts|and I'll be skins.
{}{}I'll be skins!
{}{}Sorry. When my parents were getting|divorced, I got a lot of "tigers".
{}{}I got a lot of "champs",|"chiefs", "sports".
{}{}I even got a "governor".
{}{}My mom there, my dad there.
{}{}Thanksgiving, Christmas.
{}{}She gets the house, he's in a condo|my sister will decorate with wicker.
{}{}I relied on a carefully|regimented program...
{}{}...of denial...
{}{}...and wetting the bed.
{}{}I mean, I was in there just listening|to them bitch about each other.
{}{}All I kept thinking about|was the Fourth of July.
{}{}Because it reminded you of the way...
{}{}It's just this thing.|Every year we would...
{}{}...go out on my dad's boat|and watch the fireworks.
{}{}Mom always hated it because|the ocean air made her hair all big.
{}{}...and Dad would be upset|because nobody helped.
{}{}And when we did help, he'd scream|at us for doing it wrong.
{}{}But then when the fireworks started,|everybody just shut up.
{}{}And we'd all just sort of|smoosh under this one blanket.
{}{}It never occurred to anybody|to bring another one.
{}{}And now it's...
{}{}{yi}Thanks for coming.|{yi}I hope you had fun.
{}{}All right, I'm hitting the road.
{}{}Now, I've left my  verbs|on the table.
{}{}Okay, will do. Glad you came.
{}{}- I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.|- Let me go check.
{}{}Your mom wants to say goodbye.
{}{}You drive safe.
{}{}What are you doing?
{}{}I'm getting ready|for the water skiing.
{}{}How are you?
{}{}- Where are you going?|- To get my coat.
{}{}We'll get that for you.
{}{}Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
{}{}Oh, no. No, you're not|supposed to be here.
{}{}This is the staging area.|It's all wrong. You should leave.
{}{}Or perhaps you'd like|a créme de menthe.
{}{}I have to be heading|toward my chateau.
{}{}I guess we're going back|into the hallway again.
{}{}You take care.
{}{}Oh, you kids.
{}{}Well.
{}{}Thank you!
{}{}Okay, everybody,|it's time for flan!
{}{}Yep! Get ready|for the gelatinous fun.
{}{}Okay, that's enough.
{}{}Okay, Rachel,|make a special flan wish.
{}{}Okay, I've got one.
{}{}Wow! Those things almost|never come true.

{}{}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! :D
{}{}I ordered mine first.
{}{}Yeah, but I'm so much faster.
{}{}Give it to me.
{}{}Give it to me!
{}{}Okay, you can have it.
{}{}There you go. Enjoy your coffee.
{}{}Hey, you'll never guess|who's coming to New York.
{}{}Quick, tell us before he swallows.
{}{}Ryan, that guy I dated|who's in the Navy.
{}{}I met him while playing guitar|in the park.
{}{}Ryan threw in saltwater taffy|because he didn't have change.
{}{}Is that when you wrote|{yi}Saltwater Taffy Man?
{}{}...and we have an amazing|three days together.
{}{}Only this time, he's coming for  weeks.|Two whole weeks, which means "yea"!
{}{}So this guy goes down|for, like, two years at a time?
{}{}Hi.
{}{}Oh, no. What happened?
{}{}I just spoke to Carol.|Ben's got chickenpox.
{}{}Yeah, so if you haven't had it,|chances are you'll get it.
{}{}- I've had it.|- I've had it.
{}{}- Had it.|- Had it.
{}{}The One With the Chicken Pox
{}{}English Subtitles by|GELULA & CO., INC.
{}{}Honey, you made the bed again.
{}{}Then I guess the panty raid last night|was totally uncalled for.
{}{}I'm taking a shower. Today I'll|sing Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown".
{}{}Hey, Mon, I have a question.
{}{}...or the fattest man?
{}{}The baddest. Otherwise, the song|would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown".
{}{}What are you doing?
{}{}Are you remaking the bed?
{}{}I'm sorry. The way you did it,|it was just fine.
{}{}Then you're redoing it|because...?
{}{}You're pretty much|running that risk either way.
{}{}Okay. You see...
{}{}...the duvet tag shouldn't be|at the top left corner...
{}{}- That's not so crazy.|- I'm just easing you in.
{}{}All right.
{}{}You see these little flower blossoms?
{}{}...because the head of the bed|is where the sun would be.
{}{}You don't love me anymore, do you?
{}{}Actually, if it's possible,|I love you more.
{}{}Wow. Well, then, come on!
{}{}I wanna show you how to fold|the toilet paper into a point.
{}{}If you need something|to hold you over...
{}{}Don't you need experience?
{}{}It's not hard to learn.
{}{}As for people realizing you don't know|what you're doing, you're an actor.
{}{}Here's this morning's projections.
{}{}Thanks.|Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.
{}{}Joey is a fellow processor.
{}{}I process. People want the processing,|I'm the one they call.
{}{}- Where do you work?|- Well, I'm in between things.
{}{}You know, one day you're processing,|the next day...
{}{}I told Joey about the opening|in Fleischman's group.
{}{}Fleischman's group.
{}{}Whatever you do,|don't touch his sandwiches.
{}{}This lipstick looks just great on you.
{}{}You look fabulous.|You really do.
{}{}Yeah, are you sure?|Really?
{}{}I'm hideous!
{}{}It's gonna be okay.
{}{}Ryan's been underwater.
{}{}Come in.
{}{}Hey, baby, I'm back...
{}{}Hey, Ryan. What's up?
{}{}No, no.|You have to stay back.
{}{}I have the pox!
{}{}Chicken or small?
{}{}- Why aren't you home in bed?|- My grandmother's never had chickenpox.
{}{}Please tell me you have, because|oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.
{}{}I'm sorry, I never had them.
{}{}...when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox,|and rub that kid all over my face.
{}{}Yeah, or you could wish|that I didn't have them now.
{}{}Can I see your face?
{}{}It could be lox, I wouldn't care.
{}{}And you hate fish.
{}{}So sweet. All right.
{}{}This is me.
{}{}Sorry!
{}{}I am scary!
{}{}You look lovely!|Lovely!
{}{}I hate this.
{}{}I had the most amazing|two weeks planned for us.
{}{}I've spent the last eight months|in a steel tube with men...
{}{}...thinking about this moment.
{}{}I am not gonna let a bunch...
{}{}Okay. This is the most|romantic disease I've ever had.
{}{}- How's the first day?|- Good. It's like you said.
{}{}It's putting numbers|from one column into another.
{}{}And everybody's nice. I just had|a good talk with that lady Jeannie.
{}{}Jeannie? The head of|East Coast operations, Jeannie?
{}{}Turns out our kids go|to the same school.
{}{}Weird world.
{}{}Your kids?
{}{}I figure my character has kids.
{}{}When you're acting, you need|to think about that stuff.
{}{}My character,|Joseph the processing guy...
{}{}...has two little girls,|Ashley and Brittany.
{}{}Well, invisible kids|can be that way sometimes.
{}{}You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen,|are thinking of having a third kid.
{}{}You know what?
{}{}That's some pretty powerful|imaginary sperm you must have there.
{}{}Know what makes the itching worse?
{}{}That you don't stop talking about it?
{}{}Good, okay.
{}{}Here we go, double sixes.
{}{}Here we go...
{}{}Come to Mama.|Getting ready to roll the dice...
{}{}What are you doing?|Are you scratching?
{}{}No. This is what I do|for luck, okay?
{}{}Give me the dice.
{}{}- Give me the dice.|- No! Here. There!
{}{}Look, double sixes!
{}{}I can't stop thinking about it.|It's just so hard.
{}{}I wanna grab these houses|and rub them all over my body.
{}{}- No!|- Give it!
{}{}You know you want it.|You know you want it too.
{}{}Let's just be bad.|It'll feel so good.
{}{}Come on.
{}{}- Oh, yeah.|- Okay, good. Now do me.
{}{}Do my back.|Oh, come on. Harder!
{}{}There you go.
{}{}- Don't move.|- What are you...?
{}{}Stop that.|Stop that right now.
{}{}I might've expected this of Phoebe.|But, Ryan, you're a military man.
{}{}We'll make a day of it.
{}{}That sounds lovely.|We'll have to set it up.
{}{}I better get back.|Hope the baby feels better.
{}{}- Bye-bye, Jeannie.|- Bye-bye, Joseph.
{}{}What a phony.
{}{}You'll teach her a lesson when she|steps off the dock onto nothing.
{}{}Bing, I got your memo. We're not gonna|see the report until next Friday?
{}{}My group wants to spend|the holiday with family.
{}{}I have a family.|I'm gonna be here.
{}{}It's about cutting them|a little slack for morale.
{}{}Look, I can get some|rough numbers by Wednesday.
{}{}Rough numbers?
{}{}Have the final numbers|on my desk by Tuesday.
{}{}If you say so, sir.
{}{}Joseph's good, isn't he?
{}{}Hey, I just figured Joseph's|the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.
{}{}You know, get in there,|ruffle some feathers.
{}{}Why?
{}{}Okay? If you try to pull something...
{}{}...he'll call you on it.
{}{}"What are you trying to pull?"|He'll say.
{}{}Was I supposed to bring something too?
{}{}This is for the scratchy twins.|I taped oven mitts to their hands.
{}{}You're strict.
{}{}You know, I like the way you have|efficiently folded this tab under.
{}{}See, in a tape emergency you could|shave valuable seconds off your time.
{}{}Exactly!
{}{}Tell me the truth.
{}{}Don't you like having everything|on your desk perpendicular?
{}{}If it's not a right angle,|it is a wrong angle.
{}{}Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.
{}{}You're gonna do what to my clocks?
{}{}Set them to my time.
{}{}I thought we shared time.
{}{}No. See, in my bedroom|I set my clock six minutes fast.
{}{}Wanna know why?
{}{}Forget it.
{}{}No, come on, tell me.
{}{}- You don't understand.|- Come on.
{}{}No, that's not true.
{}{}Oh, yeah?|Tell me one of yours.
{}{}One of my things is|I always separate my sweat socks...
{}{}What if they get mixed up?
{}{}Boy, I would just...
{}{}I would freak out.
{}{}I can't believe this.|I hate this. You're too normal.
{}{}I can't believe you|don't have a "thing".
{}{}My boyfriend doesn't have a "thing".
{}{}- Mr. Douglas is looking for you.|- Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
{}{}He suspects you dropped the ball|on the Lender project.
{}{}Why? Why does he suspect that?
{}{}...but after he asked Joseph about it,|turns out it was you.
{}{}- Anyway, I thought you should know.|- All right. That's it.
{}{}Look, Joey...
{}{}...and if I could just fire Joseph,|I would. But that's not possible.
{}{}So I have to let you both go.
{}{}What? Everybody loves Joseph.
{}{}I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.
{}{}You can't fire Joseph.|He's not in your department.
{}{}All right, okay.|So I can't fire Joseph...
{}{}Not Karen!
{}{}Yeah, I'm thinking about|having an affair with her.
{}{}You know what?
{}{}What the hell are you doing?
{}{}Oh, it's not me.
{}{}It's my character!
{}{}The rogue processor who seduces|his coworkers' wives...
{}{}...and then laughs about it.
{}{}In fact, I have her panties|right there in my drawer!
{}{}Take it easy.
{}{}If it means that much to you,|I'll go find something else.
{}{}Thank you.
{}{}I liked him. His wife.
{}{}She was hot.
{}{}Please take these off.|I swear I won't scratch.
{}{}Well, that wasn't easy.
{}{}Okay, dinner's on.
{}{}There's a peach cobbler|warming in the oven.
{}{}All right, you kids.|Bye, now.
{}{}- Bye.|- Oh, look, look.
{}{}A low-budget puppet show.
{}{}- Wine?|- Please.
{}{}- Spilled some.|- I got it.
{}{}You look beautiful tonight.
{}{}Sorry.
{}{}You look beautiful.
{}{}You know what? That's it.|That's it.
{}{}Good.
{}{}You guys, did you...?
{}{}{y:i}Monica...
{}{}What's up?
{}{}I thought of a thing.
{}{}Yeah?
{}{}No. You have to sleep|on this side of the bed...
{}{}...because I have to sleep|on this side of the bed.
{}{}Or so I would have you believe.
{}{}Hey, come on. You haven't|heard my reason yet.
{}{}All right, go on.
{}{}I have to sleep on the west side...
{}{}...and otherwise...
{}{}...the ocean would be on the wrong side.
{}{}Oh, my God.
{}{}How about that?
{}{}Where're you shipping off to?
{}{}I really can't say.
{}{}I can't say.
{}{}Do you get to look through|a periscope thingy?
{}{}I'm sorry, but I can't say.
{}{}- I better not miss my flight.|- I'll walk you out.
{}{}- Bye, Ryan.|- Pleasure. Take care.
{}{}So do you think we could get you|one of those uniform things?
{}{}Oh, yeah.
{}{}I'll make some calls.
{}{}Can you believe that's how|we spent our two weeks?
{}{}...like having a picnic in Central Park|and coffee at Central Perk.
{}{}Oh, I just got that!
{}{}Taxi!
{}{}I'm sorry, we're...
{}{}Hey, sailor.
{}{}Is this what you had in mind?
{}{}I'm shipping out tomorrow.
{}{}Well, then...
{}{}...we better make this night count.
{}{}Anchors aweigh.
{}{}Oh, wait, wait!|My purse, my purse!
{}{}I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
{}{}Honey!

{}{}You'll never believe|who the director was.
{}{}Who?
{}{}I'll give you one hint.
{}{}There's just one thing|that might be a problem.
{}{}See, I had to kiss this guy.
{}{}Because he was just so darn cute?
{}{}...who the main guy kisses.
{}{}Well, you're an actor. I say|you just suck it up and you do it.
{}{}Or you just do it.
{}{}- What's the problem?|- After the scene...
{}{}...Mr. Beatty comes up to me and|he says, "Good actor. Bad kisser."
{}{}Can you believe that?|Me, not a good kisser.
{}{}...like Mother Teresa,|not a good mother.
{}{}Who cares what that guy thinks?
{}{}What does Warren Beatty|know about kissing?
{}{}English Subtitles by|GELULA & CO., INC.
{}{}What did your agent say?
{}{}This kiss thing is|definitely a problem.
{}{}I gotta figure out|what I'm doing wrong.
{}{}One of you girls|come over here and kiss me.
{}{}- Forget it.|- Yeah, right.
{}{}I'll do it. I've kissed him before.|I can do it again.
{}{}See this? This is a friend.
{}{}Let's go.
{}{}Good. Very good.|Firm, but tender.
{}{}I'd recommend you to a friend.
{}{}Then I don't know|what the problem is.
{}{}Maybe you tensed up a little.
{}{}Maybe you need to work on it.
{}{}Yeah, that makes sense.
{}{}And I'll be using|his dead body as a shield.
{}{}Come out, honey.|I'm telling you, you look good.
{}{}Tell her she looks good.|Tell her she looks good.
{}{}You look so good!
{}{}I cannot believe I have to walk down|the aisle in front of  people...
{}{}...Iooking like something|you drink when you're nauseous.
{}{}It's your ex-fiancé's wedding.
{}{}Because I promised Mindy I would.
{}{}Yeah, well, you promised Barry|you'd marry him.
{}{}Besides, I need to be in a room|again with these people...
{}{}...and feel good about myself.
{}{}Someone's wearing the same clothes|as last night. Get some action?
{}{}Stud!
{}{}- What's she look like?|- We haven't met.
{}{}We stayed up talking on the Internet.
{}{}I like this girl.|I seriously like this girl.
{}{}You know how I tend to get|a little defended and quippy?
{}{}- Get out!|- No! Please.
{}{}And I did.
{}{}What's that like?
{}{}It's like this. Me.
{}{}Stop it.|You're freaking me out.
{}{}I don't like you this way.
{}{}I'll see you guys.
{}{}Bye, sweetie. I love you.
{}{}I love you too.
{}{}I think my boyfriend's|ever so dreamy.
{}{}What are you talking about?|What wedding?
{}{}You never talk about that?
{}{}No, never.
{}{}It is so nice for once not to get|hung up on, "Where is this going?"
{}{}- Afraid to ask him?|- Could not be more terrified.
{}{}I think you should|seriously consider marriage.
{}{}Where's Benny?
{}{}There he is!
{}{}Where's Benny?
{}{}Babies probably learn to talk|so they can tell grownups to cut it out.
{}{}Hey, I got a question for you.
{}{}Just a little thing, no pressure.
{}{}Sure, I do.
{}{}Yeah? Am I in it?
{}{}Honey...
{}{}Oh, God.|You're about to get so lucky.
{}{}Keep talking.
{}{}Sometimes I think about|selling my practice.
{}{}Make French toast.
{}{}Okay, so...
{}{}...we're in France...
{}{}Do you see a little bassinet|in the corner?
{}{}Like a hound?
{}{}Not a basset.
{}{}You really need the bassinet?
{}{}Well, I just think the baby|would keep falling off the dog.
{}{}Do you not see kids in our future?
{}{}I have children.
{}{}I don't wanna be |when our kids go to college...
{}{}...and our life finally starts.
{}{}...now.
{}{}Well, that's great.
{}{}We don't need to talk now.
{}{}I'm talking hovercrafts|and apes taking over the planet.
{}{}Come on, Chandler.|I want this part so much.
{}{}Just one kiss.|I won't tell anyone.
{}{}I'm sorry,|we don't have your sheep.
{}{}I think you look cute.
{}{}And you. You...
{}{}Get away from me.|I said no.
{}{}Richard's downstairs.
{}{}Richard's here?|I should go say goodbye.
{}{}How's your date with cyber-chick?
{}{}What is all that?
{}{}It's a web site.|It's the Guggenheim Museum.
{}{}...and I like funny words.
{}{}What does she mean by "H.H."?
{}{}It means we're holding hands.
{}{}I'm afraid I might just be.
{}{}I think it's so great|that you're into this person...
{}{}...yet for all you know, she could be| years old or have two heads.
{}{}It's not a guy, all right?|I know her.
{}{}It could be like a big giant guy.
{}{}Man, I got this close to him,|and Monica kneed me in the back.
{}{}We're wondering if|Chandler's girlfriend's a girl.
{}{}Ask her how long she's gonna live.
{}{}Women live longer than men.
{}{}Ask her what is her method|of birth control.
{}{}All right.
{}{}"My husband is sleeping|with his secretary."
{}{}At least we know she's a woman.
{}{}I can't believe she's married.
{}{}Oh, man, I'm sorry.
{}{}I read this article that says|you shouldn't throw rice at weddings.
{}{}When pigeons eat rice,|it kills them.
{}{}That's why you never see|pigeons in sushi bars.
{}{}I'm not thinking about that thing|that we're gonna not think about.
{}{}Neither am I.
{}{}Hey, there.|Are you all right?
{}{}And I just started thinking|I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't.
{}{}People are gonna look at me and judge me|and think about the last time.
{}{}It's gonna be okay.|It's a wedding.
{}{}I know, you're right.
{}{}Alrighty.|Everybody look at me. Good.
{}{}It's time. Bridesmaids and ushers...
{}{}I'll see you after the thing.
{}{}- Good luck.|- Thank you.
{}{}Why didn't you tell me?
{}{}Stand up and shout,|"Hey, your butt's showing!"
{}{}This is so humiliating.
{}{}The only thing worse|was in eighth grade...
{}{}Two lines into it, I freaked out.
{}{}My entire life's flashing|before my eyes.
{}{}Rach, look, I remember that.|It wasn't so bad.
{}{}Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Weinberg.
{}{}It's wonderful|to see you again, my dear.
{}{}In fact, I hardly expected|to see so much.
{}{}Well, it's wonderful to have you|up and about again, dear.
{}{}Stay well.
{}{}That's the third time someone has|said something like that to me today.
{}{}- Oh, my God, I'm married!|- I know!
{}{}I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter,|hyphen, Farber.
{}{}I am so proud of you, Min.
{}{}Oh, Rach. Still here.
{}{}At our wedding, they'd packed up|the chopped liver by now.
{}{}Yeah, I love that story.
{}{}Why do people keep saying|it's good to see me up and about?
{}{}After you ran out on your wedding...
{}{}...Barry's parents told people|you were sort of...
{}{}Insane?
{}{}From the syphilis.
{}{}What?
{}{}Angela?
{}{}Joey Tribbiani.
{}{}Listen, what are you doing tonight?
{}{}You gonna answer? That's the th|bing-bong message she's sent.
{}{}She asks what's wrong.
{}{}What's wrong?|You're married!
{}{}Oh, my.
{}{}She wants to meet you.
{}{}Look, Phoebe,|I wanted to meet her too.
{}{}What if he's the wrong guy|and you are the right guy?
{}{}You don't get these|chances all the time.
{}{}If you don't meet her, you'll|kick yourself when you're ...
{}{}Okay. I'll do it.
{}{}Okay, great! Put on your shoes|and then march out there and meet her.
{}{}No, wait! You have|to take a shower because...
{}{}No, you have to answer her.|Answer her first.
{}{}No, make some coffee|because it's too much.
{}{}Okay, one more, please.|I'm gonna get it in this time.
{}{}Again, I'm sorry.
{}{}You know what, maybe I don't|need to have children.
{}{}Maybe I just think I do|because that's what society...
{}{}...has always convinced me that I...
{}{}I do.
{}{}I have to have children.|I'm sorry, I just do.
{}{}Best man making a toast here.
{}{}Thank you.
{}{}I remember when Barry got home|from his first date with Rachel.
{}{}Thank you.|Thank you very much.
{}{}Anyway, I wish you both...
{}{}...a wonderful life together.
{}{}What?
{}{}No, no, in all seriousness.
{}{}Not a lot of women would|have the guts to be here.
{}{}I'd like to add something to that.
{}{}What are you adding?|What are you adding?
{}{}Most of you don't know me.|I'm Rachel's boyfriend...
{}{}...Ross.
{}{}And I'd just like to say that...
{}{}...it did take a lot of courage|for Rachel to come here tonight.
{}{}...she did not run out on Barry|because she had syphilis.
{}{}I'm serious.
{}{}The reason...
{}{}...she didn't love him.
{}{}Which, incidentally,|worked out pretty well for me.
{}{}Cheers.
{}{}And once again,|she is out of here!
{}{}You know what, Bar?|I'm not gonna leave.
{}{}I promised myself I'd make it|through at least one of your weddings.
{}{}Tonight, all I wanted was|to make it through this evening...
{}{}...with a little bit of grace|and dignity.
{}{}I guess there's nothing|really left to say...
{}{}...except...
{}{}{y:i}Her name was Lola
{}{}{yi}With yellow feath...
{}{}{yi}And a dress cut down to there
{}{}{yi}- Merengue|- "Merengue..." Thank you, honey.
{}{}{y:i}And while she'd like to be a star|{y:i}Tony always tended bar
{}{}Everybody!
{}{}{y:i}The hottest spot north of Havana
{}{}{yi}Copacabana
{}{}I'll do it.
{}{}If it takes kids to be with you,|then kids it is.
{}{}Oh, my God.
{}{}If I have to,|I'll do it all again.
{}{}I'll go to the PTA meetings.
{}{}I'll coach the soccer team.
{}{}- Really?|- Yeah, if I have to.
{}{}...I don't wanna lose you.
{}{}So if I have to do it all again...
{}{}...then I will.
{}{}And if you hadn't have said...
{}{}..."If I have to", like,  times...
{}{}...then I'd be saying,|"Okay, let's do it."
{}{}Oh, my God. I can't believe|what I'm getting ready to say.
{}{}I wanna have a baby.
{}{}But I don't want to have one with|someone who doesn't really want one.
{}{}I love you.
{}{}I know you do.
{}{}Me too.
{}{}I guess we just...
{}{}...keep dancing.
{}{}Where is she?|Where is she?
{}{}Where is she?
{}{}Relax, Chandler.|She'll be here.
{}{}Oh, that's her.
{}{}You gotta stop|staring at the door...
{}{}...like a watched pot.
{}{}If you keep looking at it,|the door's never gonna boil.
{}{}Oh, my God.
{}{}Oh...
{}{}...my...
{}{}Oh...
{}{}...my...
{}{}...God.
{}{}I've felt guilty because|I wanna be a good friend.
{}{}And damn it, I am a good friend.|So shut up and close your eyes.
{}{}You are a good friend.
{}{}But that was a hell of a kiss.
{}{}Rachel is a very lucky girl.
