The way you crushed Mike at Ping-Pong
but I'm a little tired.
- I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
- You're on.
- Hey.
- What's up?
Well, Mike's taking a shower, which,
So if you want--
- Finally.
- Is that Ross?
Yeah. You can hear everything
through these stupid walls.
- Sounds like he's with someone.
and then talk to his triceps.
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right.
Yeah, I hear someone else
in there with him.
- Dr. Geller!
- God, you're amazing.
I didn't even have to ask you
- She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
Oh, that tart! Floozy! Giant!
- I'm not sure about this.
- Yeah, you're right.
This is none of our business.
I'm not sure it's the best way
to hear everything. Get me a glass!
No, I'm not gonna do this, okay?
I'm kissing Rachel!
I know. I'm her.
Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!
- What?
- Get over here!
Oh, my God! I love how thin
these walls are!
Thank you.
Hey, before, you said that nothing could
- What?
Ross and Charlie?
Wow! She's really making her way
through the group, huh?
- Eh, who am I to talk?
- Yeah.
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
How about the dinosaur twins
- I'm on it!
- Anything?
- I think I hear curtains closing.
We've got shoes being kicked off
over here.
Bedsprings! Unmistakable!
- You realize that's your brother.
leaving with the person we came with!
That's not true. I came with Monica,
I'm leaving with Weird Al.
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes.
- Tomorrow I'm going to the salon.
- Okay, Buckwheat.
You gotta hear this, it's great!
- It's just-- I don't think I can do this.
Oh, is it because of what might
be on the bed?
- I saw that report, with the infrared--
- No! No.
No.
Look, I need to talk to Joey.
us, I need to know he's okay with it.
- I completely understand.
- All right, I'm gonna go find him.
I just need a second before I can,
you know....
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma.
- Okay, I'll see you later.
you know it too well.
Hey, what are you guys doing?
We're just-- We're sad to go, so we're
just saying goodbye to the hotel.
I love you...
...Paradise Hotel Golf Resort and Spa.
Yeah. We had a great time, thank you.
Bye.
Okay. Hey, have you guys
seen Joey anywhere?
He's probably in his room
I'm looking for him?
- You got it.
- Thanks.
Thank you.
Other wall, people! Other wall!
- Rach, you there?
- Oh, my God, that's Ross!
- What are we gonna do?
we're just hanging out.
All right? So just be nonchalant.
- That's not nonchalant!
- No idea what it means.
Okay, just hide.
- Rach?
- Coming! Try under the bed.
There's no room under the bed--
- Is everything okay?
- Hi.
I really don't.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah. Sure.
I don't believe this.
Have you guys been--?
This is the listening side of the wall.
Then she told me
was she had feelings for me.
Right. Yeah.
You know I've wanted to ask Charlie
out since the day I met her.
Oh, I know, I know.
That's been really hard for you.
Anyway, one thing led to another, and...
...before you know it, we were kissing.
How angry do you think
That is hard to say.
I gotta find him.
He's gotta be here someplace.
You would think.
Joey?
- Is he gone?
- How are you doing this?
What? Hey!
What are you--? What is this?
We kissed for  minutes...
...and now we're talking to our friends
about it, so I guess this is sixth grade.
No, no. Have you thought
about how complicated this could get?
- What about Ross?
before anything really happens with her.
And as his friend, I mean, don't you
think he deserves the same from you?
You're a pain in my ass, Geller.
Look, we appreciate all the advice...
...but this is between Joey and me.
We can handle it.
We'll go. Will you do one thing for us,
- Enunciate.
Get out!
Are they right?
Probably, yeah. I mean,
maybe we should...
...hold off until we talk to Ross.
Yeah. Yeah. We can wait.
We don't have to do anything tonight.
Yeah, I think that would be best.
So, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna take off.
- Although--
as high school.
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
Absolutely.
- He's not thinking about you.
- No.
I'm thinking about you.
Yeah.
- Let's forget about Ross.
- It's forgotten.
- What's wrong?
Come here. Come here.
What's wrong?
Sorry, I just....
I can't seem to get Ross
out of my head.
Well, maybe I can help.
Your lips are so soft. Do that again.
Yeah, we need to talk to Ross. Yeah.
Hey. You guys ready to go?
Not quite. Monica's at the salon,
and I'm finishing packing.
Dude, you're not taking your Bible?
You're not supposed to take that.
Besides, it's a New Testament.
- So did you talk to Joey?
No. I couldn't find him. I'm just
gonna talk to him on the plane.
Okay. Sounds like a good idea,
Dr. Geller.
Stop it.
Ph.D.
You're filthy.
- Hey. Have you guys seen Monica?
to the salon, all right.
Check it out!
Whose day just got better?
Chandler!
Hey!
- What do you think?
- I think....
I think I can see your scalp.
Don't you just love it?
Yeah. Yeah, you got shellfish
in your head.
It's something. You go, girlfriend.
- You never said that in your life.
- I'm so glad you did that.
Oh, and listen to this.
What do you know? It's a treat
for the eyes and the ears.
Wow, it's kind of weird that I'm
sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
Yeah. It's almost as if Air Barbados
and sitting with Charlie?
Oh, I mean, l-- Dude, I spent
the whole conference with Charlie.
- I understand.
- No, I'll do it.
Wish I could switch. I really don't want
- Hey.
Once we're in the air and the
captain turns off the seat belt sign...
...you feel free to roam about my cabin.
And you should be careful
when checking your overhead bins.
- Because items may shift during--
- No, I think I could come over.
It's Saturday, right?
What?
- I can't do anything tonight.
- Why not?
I have a date.
- You have a date? With who?
- Oh, it's my girlfriend.
- You have a girlfriend?
I started seeing someone.
- Well, for how long?
- Three months.
Three months?
Okay.
This is none of my business, but how
long are you gonna keep seeing her?
I'll tell her that it's over
special delivery package waiting for you.
Maybe I'll sign for it, tear it open.
- Pull out the packing material--
- We'll have sex. Let's leave it there.
It's our last glimpse of Barbados.
And my last glimpse of anything.
All right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey.
I think this is the right time.
He's in a good mood after
then nothing more can happen between us.
I know.
Well, if that's the case,
I just want you to know...
...that I think I could have fallen for you
really, really hard.
On the other hand,
would be a good time to talk to him.
I guess so. I'm just--
I'm really nervous.
Well, keep in mind
that by the time you're done...
...they'll probably be serving dinner.
Still nervous?
I'm gonna get the lasagna.
- Hey, Rach?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah.
<iGood luck.</i
- Hey.
- Hey.
So l....
I kind of need to talk to you
about Charlie.
- Yeah?
by the way.
Well, Charlie and I were talking, and....
Well....
You kissed.
Wh-- What?
What? What would give you that idea?
- I saw you.
- Yeah, we kissed.
But nothing else.
Nothing else happened, okay?
- Ross, Ross, Ross. It's okay.
You guys...
...make way more sense than her
and I ever did, you know? And....
- I want you to be happy.
- Are you serious?
Yeah.
- Now I have something--
my happiness first like that, I mean....
You're an incredible friend,
do you know that?
- Well, look, before you go--
- No, I mean it.
I mean, you're so loyal, man.
of him as my best friend. But now...
...l may have to rethink some stuff.
Dude!
Hey, if there is ever anything
I can do for you....
I can't think of anything.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
- So hi.
- Oh, yeah. We had a really good talk.
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.
- So everything's okay?
- Oh, no, it's great.
- It's great. He's an amazing guy.
some very dirty dreams about this.
Excuse me.
You didn't tell him, did you?
I couldn't. He was saying all
these really nice things about me.
I didn't want him to get mad and take
them back. I'm gonna edge out Chandler!
Fine. Forget it. When we go back
- Hey, it's Mike.
- That was fast.
- <iOh, no, she's not here yet.</i
You know, I'm just gonna take off
and break up with her over the phone.
You can't do that. Oh, come on, Mike,
together. Women appreciate honesty.
We also appreciate gentle spanking
once in a while, just FYl.
One more thing. There might be a picture
of Precious on my coffee table.
Her name's Precious?
Is she a pure breed,
- Okay. And if she gets upset...
...just scratch her tummy
and give her a liver snap.
What do you know,
another hot blonde.
Hi. I'm Precious. Who are you?
- I'm Phoebe.
The love of his life? That Phoebe?
Oh, I can't wait for everyone
at work to see these!
- You go back to work tomorrow night?
- Yeah.
So if you want people to see them...
...you're not having them taken out,
then I wouldn't be able to do this.
You like that, right?
- What are you singing?
- It's "Bolero" from <i.</i
It's "Ride of the Valkyries"
Here's the thing. The cornrows were
that problem. If you think about it....
I hate them.
- What? You said you liked them.
- Did l? Let's refresh.
I believe what I said was
that I could see your scalp.
Well, fine. So you don't like them.
noticed the shape of your skull before.
And Joey? Well, Joey didn't realize
there was anything different.
You know what? I don't care.
I like it, and I'm gonna keep it.
You're just jealous
- And the eye.
Hi! There she is! Hi, Emma.
Oh, my God, I missed you.
Oh, Emma, I missed you so much. Hi.
Did you have a good time
with Grandma Greene? Huh?
Did she give you a bottle of
and they were only, like, five milligrams.
Hey, Emma, Daddy has some presents for
you, okay? I want you to wait right here.
Come here, sweetie.
Ross, actually, there's something
that I really need to talk to you about.
Okay, shoot.
- Okay. All right, here's the deal.
- Oh, major shampoo explosion!
- Look, Ross, this really isn't easy.
- Oh, it's all over everything!
Why? Why me?
Because you took  bottles
of shampoo?
I guess things were
- Oh, not another one!
Oh, my God-- Oh, and this is moisturizer!
It's even harder to clean!
Why? Why do bad things happen
to good people?
- Wow. Clearly this is not a good time.
he thought at the restaurant, so....
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
The point is, I'm gonna take off.
Wait. I'm not letting you leave until
you tell me what's going on. I mean...
...are you guys getting back together
And unfortunately...
...that effectively ends
your relationship with him.
He's very sorry about that, and wishes
you the best luck in all your endeavors.
I just can't believe this. Why?
- Well, I don't--
- There's nothing wrong with you.
What the hell am I supposed to do now?
Damn it, woman! Pull yourself together!
Have some pride, for the love of God!
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
I just can't believe that Mike
didn't give me any warning.
He didn't know. He wasn't planning on
coming to Barbados and proposing to me.
He proposed to you?
You're an attractive, intelligent woman...
...and let's face it,
Mike's kind of a wang.
He proposed to me
while he was still seeing you.
He was gonna break up with you
he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
Oh, my God, you know, maybe
you're right. Maybe I don't need him.
I deserve to be treated with respect.
Screw you, Mike. You're a coward
and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell!
You're welcome.
Honey? You've been in there
and singing "No Woman, No Cry" ...
...and I got stuck.
- You can't move at all?
- Oh, I can move.
If I untangle you, will you please
get rid of the cornrows?
I guess so.
- Some of these look a little frayed.
- Hi.
- So? Did you tell Ross?
- Well, I tried...
...but then he had
a shampoo-related emergency.
- So I guess now it's your turn again.
You know, it's easier for a woman.
That way, you know, if he gets mad,
"l didn't mean it.
I'm so sorry."
Yeah, because that's what we do.
All right, all right, okay. How about this?
How about this? Tomorrow....
Tomorrow we'll both go
- I know.
That's okay. I mean, we can
control ourselves. We're not animals.
- No! Of course, we can wait.
- Yeah.
All right, so I guess
- Stop saying good night.
I'm so sorry.
Look what I found in the drawer.
And you said I'd never wear this.
Now that I untangled you, how about
you do a little something for me?
- Sure. What did you have in mind?
- I think you know.
- Really? I don't-- I don't really feel like it.
as a beauty contestant!
Okay, Ross.
I realize that you didn't expect
to walk in and see that, but....
- Let me explain, okay?
- We weren't doing anything!
Rach, he just saw us.
But what you saw,
- Dude, chill!
Okay, we also kissed in Barbados...
...but we didn't plan it.
The only reason that that happened...
...was because I saw you kiss Charlie.
Yeah, you started it!
I have got to chill.
Look, we probably should have talked to
- Oh, we feel so terrible about this, Ross.
Yeah. But it did happen.
So....
Ross?
Ross?
Can we just close the door?
Ross, say something.
Anything.
So you two are...?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
And have you had...?
- No. No, no, no.
- No. No.
But if I hadn't walked in here,
No. No.
Ross, this is not how we wanted you
to find out about this.
You have every right
to go nuts.
I'm not going nuts.
- Absolutely.
I'm fine.
Totally fine.
I don't know why it's coming out
all loud and squeaky...
...because, really, I'm fine.
I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised
to see you guys kissing.
I mean, at first I was like:
But now that I've had time
- It's all working out.
Me and Charlie.
And you two.
- You know what we should do?
- Calm ourselves?
No.
We should all have dinner.
Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.
that would be a little weird?
Weird? What? What's weird?
The only thing weird would be
if someone didn't like Mexican food...
...because I'm making fajitas!
I do like fajitas.
God, this adoption stuff
is so overwhelming.
There's inter-country adoption,
like, the biggest decision of our lives.
There's a hair in my coffee.
Hey, guys.
Have you seen Frank Jr.?
He's meeting me here with the triplets.
It's funny,
every time you say "triplets" ...
...l think of three hot,
from different adoption agencies.
Babies! Oh, this one is so cute.
Get this one.
That's not really how it works.
- Oh, how does it work?
- I don't know!
If you're having a hard time,
you should talk to my friends...
...Bill and Colleen. They adopted
wouldn't that be great?
All right, all right.
Remember what we talked about.
When we're in a public place,
there are certain rules.
That's not what we talked about!
- Hi, Frank.
- Good to see you too.
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi. Hey, how you doing?
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten
so big. Which one is which again?
Well, that's Frank Jr. Jr...
...pulling the tampons out
climbing on Chandler.
That's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
She's got quite an arm there,
doesn't she? Yeah.
Hey, guys, come give me a hug.
Triplets, hug your aunt!
It's like hugging fresh cookies.
Oh, okay.
I'm gonna eat you!
So how you been, Frank?
Oh, good, you know. Life is all right.
Just taking it day by day.
Seems like somebody needs something.
Oh, no. He's just trying
- No, it's fine.
After I black out,
he tries to put it back in, so....
"Willing to adopt triplets?" No.
Can I just say, I know we're doing this
for Ross and that's cool.
But if it was up to me, this is not what
for a romantic night.
Some champagne, fancy dinner,
feel you up on the carriage ride home.
Feel me up?
In a carriage.
Well, maybe we can have our date
later on tonight.
You know, after this,
light some candles, and then....
You want to say feel me up,
don't you?
I just think it's something we should do.
- Hey, Charlie!
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Oh, you bet.
So did you bring
a little something for Ross?
Actually, it's some stuff you left
at my apartment.
Well, thanks.
And you can just give me
to introduce me to your new girlfriend.
I'm just kidding. I know Rachel.
I know....
Come. Please come in.
Come in.
Okay.
- Actually, that's--
Underwear, a toothbrush...
...and a Van Halen CD.
I can use all these things!
Gosh, Ross, you know,
you seem a little--
What? Fine? Because I am.
Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't--?
You see?
Who else is fine?
Come on.
Listen. Why don't you try to relax.
that is a very good idea.
I'm gonna go make
a pitcher of margaritas.
Oh, God.
So adorable.
Look at them,
sleeping there like angels.
Yeah, I really cherish
they're gonna be awake again.
Well, they may be a handful...
- ...but they're so cute.
- Yeah.
Oh, God, last time I babysat them,
they did the funniest thing.
I haven't slept in four years.
That's a long time.
You just don't know
You just hold one in each hand.
What do I do when the third one runs
at me with his bike helmet on?
I got no more hands
to protect my area.
There's three of them, Phoebe.
were coming out of my area.
Sometimes, I think that--
Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it.
It's too horrible. No.
What?
No, no, I can't.
Oh, my God, Frank.
Are you thinking of leaving?
Because I didn't have those triplets
No. I just...
...was thinking that, you know,
maybe you could take one.
What?
You can't separate them, that's terrible!
Which one?
Thank you so much for seeing us.
Phoebe has told us great things
when we were adopting.
So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees
and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
I mean, you have a lovely home.
We appreciate anything
you can tell us.
Well, actually,
- Oh, my God.
Everything is broken into categories,
then cross-referenced.
Then color-coded to correspond
with the forms in the back.
Thank you.
I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
I know the process is frustrating,
that ever happened to us.
That's great. Can I see the book?
You want me to wash
my hands first, don't you?
Please. It's just so pretty and white.
Bathroom is down the hall to your left.
I would have told him to do it too.
Can I adopt you?
- Hey, you must be Owen.
- Yeah.
I'm Chandler.
- In fact, my father was a den mother.
You know how to use a compass?
I have a badge in it.
- You do? That's fantastic.
- You want to see it?
I'd love to, but I gotta get back
to your parents.
They're telling us
Can you fix it for me?
I can't believe I'm adopted.
So you're not gonna fix my arm?
Well, that first batch of margaritas
was not so great...
...but this second batch is good.
Well, maybe the next batch,
we could all get some.
Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it?
You know, just the four of us.
Just hanging.
Dude, are you okay?
And when are the fajitas
I'm just proud of us.
You know?
There's no weirdness, no tension.
No awareness.
We make a great foursome.
We should do more stuff together.
Let's take a trip!
We could all go on your boat.
Joey has this amazing sailboat.
Actually, Ross, I sold the boat
- Yeah?
Okay, where do you think we can go?
My fajitas!
Look, Charlie,
I just want you to know...
...Ross is just having a little trouble
adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.
You know, he normally
My father is a raging alcoholic.
I'm sorry, have I made
this evening uncomfortable?
Fajitas! Be careful!
Very hot plate! Very hot!
Ross, you don't
taking one of your kids, can we?
Oh, no, of course we're not.
- That's insane.
- I know.
Alice would never go for it.
She's pretty tired too.
I think we could get her on board.
Well, just for argument's sake,
would you be willing to give up?
Frank Jr. Jr.?
Well, it'd be great for my shoulder.
You'd be getting a really good one.
He's really funny.
Like, the other day,
What's green and says,
"Hey, I'm a frog"?
A talking frog.
Oh, no, you can't have him,
What about Leslie?
Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No.
She's the only one that knows how
to burp the alphabet.
All right, so that leaves Chandler.
No, no, you can't have Chandler.
No, no. She's my little genius.
I got big hopes for her.
She's gonna be a doctor
I think we just ran out of kids.
Oh, I think you're right.
Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think
I can give one of them up.
I mean, you know, they drive me crazy,
but they're my babies.
I'm sorry, Frank,
I can baby-sit anytime you want.
You name the day and I'll be there.
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, that's not good.
But I can move some stuff around
and I'll be there.
You and Alice just take
That's what sisters are for.
Oh, look at them.
I love you so much.
Oh, crap, don't wake up!
Don't wake up!
- Where are Bill and Colleen?
- Kitchen, getting something to eat.
Can you believe
What did you do in the bathroom?
I didn't get to the bathroom.
I bumped into Owen on the way.
He didn't know he was adopted.
There's a slight chance...
...l may have told him.
Oh, my God, where's my purse?
- Hi.
Some little snacks for everybody.
You don't have to eat the sour worms.
Those are for Owen.
I'll go get him in a second.
By the way, you should know,
we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
But kids are so intuitive.
Don't you think, on some level,
- See? Intuitive.
What? Where did you hear that?
He told me.
And he paid me  dollars not to tell.
Which, technically,
now you should give back.
You told him he's adopted?
I'm sorry. You should have
a sign out there or something.
Or at least whisper it to people
and he also thinks Santa is real."
He isn't?
We have to get out of here, baby.
What is the matter with you?
All right, look, I know
what Chandler did was not the best...
...but anyone would assume that
a  -year-old has been told he's adopted.
- Yeah, he's .
to make a toast...
...to Rachel and Joey.
And to love.
Ah, love!
L-O-V-E. Love.
L is for "life."
And what is life without love?
Oh, my God, are we supposed
to answer?
"Oh, wow!"
The V is for this...
...very surprising turn of events...
...which I am still fine with,
by the way.
E...
...is for how...
...extremely normal I find it...
...that you two...
...are together.
And that one day
- Totally.
Ross, you don't seem okay.
I'm sorry, it must be
the pressure of entertaining.
I think everyone would
feel better if we had some flan.
Wait, Ross. Ross, l--
- I'm sorry.
I have an early class in the morning.
But this has been lovely.
Wasn't it? And you thought it
would be awkward with Joey.
And that you never
really liked Rachel.
You are on fire!
- All right.
God, Rachel, what Ross just said,
that's just--
That's okay.
Girls tend not to like me.
Fine.
Okay. I guess it's just flan for three.
Hey, that rhymes.
You know what, Ross,
just want to be alone.
- No, it's just getting late--
- It's fine. It's totally fine.
I've got plenty of margaritas.
It's all good.
I don't even know what that's for.
You know what?
I think I'm gonna stay here
- I'll see you in the morning.
Okay.
Yeah, you know, Joey, l--
I don't think he's ever
gonna be okay with this.
It doesn't look good, does it?
I guess I made Tater Tots.
Ross, oven mitts!
Morning.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
- Did you stay here all night?
were dancing to the <iChicago</i soundtrack.
Look, Ross...
...about Rachel and l. Listen, you don't
have to worry about that...
...because nothing's gonna happen.
What do you mean?
She and I said from the beginning...
...we weren't gonna do anything
unless you were okay with it.
And clearly--
What are you talking about?
- No.
It's okay, Ross.
You know, I totally understand.
Of course you're not fine. You're....
You're Ross and Rachel.
Yeah, except we're not.
I mean, we haven't been
a couple in, like...
...six years.
My God, is that right?
Has it been that long?
That's what I hear, yeah.
This is crazy.
you guys aren't gonna be together?
Can I ask you something?
Really...
...what is this thing
with you and Rachel?
Come on, you know me.
You know....
Joey.
I'm crazy about her.
And she feels the same way?
I think so.
Well, then...
...maybe it's time
you're not okay with it, so--
No, but I want to be.
I will be.
Besides, I'm with Charlie, right?
Oh, my God,
I'm still with Charlie, aren't l?
- She didn't see the dance, did she?
- No, no, no.
No, that was--
- Hey.
We just want to give
you a heads up.
- Bill and Colleen hate us.
- Why?
Owen didn't know he's adopted
- No, he's only .
I'll bet he's Russian.
Still, he had to find out sometime.
How would you like it if someone told
the triplets that you gave birth to them?
I'm gonna go tell Emma
she was an accident.
Hey, Chandler, why do you think
- What?
You're curious.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I'll drop Emma off at my mom's
if we're still on tonight.
- Oh, you bet. Yeah.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- So you and Rachel tonight, huh?
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's actually
You nervous?
No. This is the part
I'm actually good at.
What must it be like not to be
crippled by fear and self-loathing?
It's okay.
How can you be so confident?
Well, I know exactly
- No. See, each woman is different.
You have to appreciate
their uniqueness.
- Really?
- No, I do six things.
First, I look deep into her eyes,
and I softly graze her thigh.
You mean like this?
No, not like that. No, no.
I see what you mean.
That's quite nice.
- More foosball?
- Hey.
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, stop staring at my wife's legs.
No, no. Stop staring
at your sister's legs.
I'm sorry, it's just--
How'd you get so tan?
She went to one of those
Like, with the toe separators?
Why? Why?
I can't believe that's sprayed on.
I mean, it looks really good.
I wonder if I should get one.
Sure, then you should get a miniskirt
so you can really show it off.
So do you get colors
- Thanks.
Hey, I know where this place is.
It used to be an X-rated video--
Florist.
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs.
You won't believe
who moved back to town.
I know. Amanda.
- She called me too. She's the worst.
in the building before you did.
Then she moved to England and
picked up this fake British accent.
"Monica, darling, it's Amanda calling."
Are you trying to do a British accent?
Chandler gets pedicures.
Just so I know, how many more
of those can I expect?
Know what Amanda said
on your mobile."
If you didn't wanna get me on my mobile,
then don't call me on my mobile.
And she always brags about
all the famous people she's met.
Oh, I know!
"I slept with Billy Joel."
All right, who hasn't?
What are we gonna do?
- Cut her out of our lives.
Just ignore her calls
and dodge her till she gets the point.
Well, I guess we could try that.
But it seems so harsh.
- Have you ever done that?
We have one, two or three.
Well, I like how you look.
What are you?
- Puerto Rican.
- Two. I think a two.
You'll face the red light.
When the light's on, the spraying's
count to five...
...pat yourself to avoid drip marks,
then turn to get your back. Got it?
Spray, count, pat and turn.
Spray, count and pat.
- You catch on quick.
two Mississippi, three--
Wait, wait! I'm not--
I'm not finished counting!
You sprayed my front twice!
- You never turned?
- No! I barely got to "three Mississippi"!
Mississippi? I said count to five.
Mississippi-less-ly?
Well, how bad is it?
Not that bad yet. But it gets
- You got sprayed with two twos and--
I'm a four?
Yeah, but your back's a zero.
You'll wanna even that out.
Really?
- You might wanna get back in there.
- Oh, okay!
Wait a minute,
when it's gonna start? Hello?
My eyes!
The same thing happened again!
- You got two more twos?
- I'm an eight!
Thanks for dinner.
I thought you paid.
Guess we won't be going back there.
- So....
- Yeah.
Hey, what do you say we move this
- I don't know. I'm sorry.
- I don't know why I did that.
- Okay.
Okay. Sorry.
I'm sorry. Again, I don't know
what happened. I must be nervous.
I don't get it. Chandler loved it.
I promise. I won't do it again.
- Okay.
Was that good for you?
No, don't get it.
Let the machine pick up.
Yeah, it could be Rachel asking
if someone could babysit again.
- It could be Amanda.
Babysitting's a gas.
<iHello, Monica.</i
<i>It's Amanda calling again.</i>
<i>I'm in the neighborhood,</i>
You're from Yonkers!
<i>So should you get this directly...</i>
<i>...ring me back on my mobile.</i>
Okay, don't hold thy breath.
- <i>Hello? Is someone on the line?</i>
- <i>Yes. I was looking for Monica.</i>
Hang on, she's right here.
- Someone's on the phone for you.
- We weren't picking up. It's Amanda.
I get pedicures.
Hi, Amanda.
Actually, now is not a good time.
Dinner tomorrow night?
Okay, Phoebe and I will see you then.
Why? Why?
I couldn't say no twice.
I got this uncontrollable need
to please people.
Fine. Fine. You would not
hold up well under torture.
- Oh, and you would?
- Absolutely.
It's just a little weird.
It's you, and it's me.
- It'll just take some getting used to.
- Okay.
Okay, well, how can
- Okay, got it, yeah. Absolutely.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Is this thing welded shut?
- Okay.
- You want a little help?
- I can handle it. Okay?
- I've been opening these since I was .
- Nine?
- What kind of -year-old girl wears a bra?
- No, no. I was .
See, she was . Okay? Yeah.
My parents had-- I can't talk
I gotta get a look at this thing.
Sorry.
Well, this is romantic.
I'm sorry. This has never
happened to me before.
I'm an expert at taking off bras.
I could do it with one hand.
I could do it with my eyes closed.
- It's a standard-issue bra clasp.
Then I blame you. Yeah. That's right.
You threw me off with all your slapping.
Okay, look, I'm really sorry
about that, Joey.
But do you think maybe, on some level,
your wife suggested.
Was that place the sun?
Oh, and it gets worse.
Oh, my God, you can do a duet
of "Ebony and lvory" all by yourself.
How could you mess this up?
It's so easy.
You go in the booth,
- One, two, three--
Damn it!
I know!
What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
How was your date with Joey?
Well, it was good,
until we got back to our apartment.
And then we were fooling around and
he started to put his hand up my leg...
...and I kept slapping it away.
You didn't like that?
Well, it wasn't just me, all right?
at my bra and it popped open.
I do not know what's wrong with us.
We've kissed before
and that's been great.
But this time
it was leading somewhere...
...and I was very aware of the fact
was weird.
You couldn't stop laughing.
You got through that.
Okay. That's true.
That's true, we can do this.
You're right. We can do this.
for a second?
No need, problem solved.
We are powering through.
Chandler, stop.
It's not going to pop open.
You don't know.
- Hi, Phoebe.
- No.
I'm sorry for screwing up that "cutting
her out" plan, but I have a new plan.
Chandler will call in a few minutes
with an emergency.
Okay, what kind of emergency
being in a car accident?
- Are you kidding? I love it!
- Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hello!
It's so nice to see you.
Both of you, look at me.
so much to catch up on.
But first things first. Touch my abs.
I don't exercise at all.
Oh, gosh. So, Monica, you're married.
- Yeah, his name is Chandler and he's--
- Oh, smell my neck.
It's not perfume. It's me.
Gosh, it's just like old times.
I'm so happy you two
are friends again.
- When were we not friends?
- Well, it was .
And I remember, because that was
you were dodging her calls...
...and trying to avoid seeing her.
- You were going to cut me out?
- Well, kind of.
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, bugger.
Should I not have said that?
Yeah, I'll be right there.
I'm so sorry, but Chandler
was in a car accident.
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
- Was Mike with him?
- Yes. Ready to power through.
Excellent. Put it on ice,
the phone is off the hook...
...and, in the interest
of powering through....
Oh, sure. Now. Yeah.
Okay, sexy...
...very sexy. Sexy.
we gotta do this.
- Okay. You like that, huh?
- Oh, yeah.
You like that? Let's kick this
into high gear, huh?
Yeah, baby!
I'm so sorry.
Joey? Are you okay?
Soldier down.
We are not friends
with Phoebe anymore.
If she asks,
I protested a little, but okay.
I just found out
why someone would want to do that?
What is wrong with me,
Chandler? Tell me.
I had a very bad car accident.
Chandler, thank God you're alive.
Monica, can I talk to you outside?
- I have nothing to say to you.
to be one of the Spice Girls.
Please, Monica, in the hall?
Oh, that accident
must have been terrible.
You look positively ghastly.
Well, aren't you a treat.
I can't believe you tried to cut me out.
Why, Phoebe? Why?
It was right after we
and compulsive and shrill.
Well, I'm still all those things!
You're also so generous
and kind and scrappy.
I am scrappy.
Exactly. No matter what I tried to do,
I couldn't keep you out of my life.
Of all the people I've cut out...
...you were the only one
you fought your way back in...
...because I don't know what
I would do without you.
I don't know what
I would do without you.
Well, I guess we should go back in.
- Yeah, I guess you're right.
Can you believe it? I've never had
any professional dance training.
Now, let me explain how this works.
You go into the booth and--
I'm gonna stop you
my first time?
Now, I want four two's,
and I want them all on my back.
Okay.
Wait. There's two sets of nozzles!
Which one is it? Which one is it?
Oh, son of a bitch!
Are you kidding?
- How did we do?
the matter with me.
No, I mean with us, you know?
I mean, is it supposed to be this...
...difficult?
I don't know.
That fake British woman's a real bitch,
but she sure can dance.
- Hey.
When you and Monica first hooked up...
...was it weird going from friends
to more than that?
Kind of. Sneaking around,
having to hide from you guys--
No, no, no. No, I mean...
...sexually.
Yeah, was there a part
No, it felt right, you know?
If felt like, "l can't believe we haven't
been doing this the whole time."
I can tell from your expressions that's
the good news you were hoping for.
Well, I'm gonna go continue
for them doesn't mean it has to for us.
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
I mean, just because something's
difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
- Right, totally.
- Yeah. And so...
...we'll just keep trying
that never has sex.
That's a plan.
- I did not see this coming.
- I know.
I don't know, I don't get it. I mean,
I was so sure this is what I wanted.
Me too.
Well, how come Monica
as good friends as we are.
I bet you're right.
So....
Yeah.
I love you.
Love you too.
- All right, I'm going to bed.
- Yeah, me too.
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere
for a while.
- Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
same thing happened to me. Let me in.
Really?
Did you count Mississippi-ly?
You're not tan.
No. I just had to get a picture of this.
I'll see you later.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.
Honey, I got us that room at the
You can take a hint.
You can't go away this weekend.
It's Emma's birthday.
We're having a party.
Can't you have the party
when we get back?
No. It won't be her real birthday.
Gee, if only she were  and had
this is really important to us.
Sorry, but Chandler and l
could really use a weekend away...
- ...you know, to reconnect, emotionally.
- There's this thing I really want us to do.
Well, can't you just go
weird sex stuff to my little sister.
And, I mean, you know, you guys,
this is a big deal.
How can we have her first birthday party
without her aunt and her uncle?
I promise I won't do any magic.
All right, we'll stay.
this <i>Maxim</i> thing because of this party--
Believe me, that is not why
we won't be doing that.
You know, Pheebs, when I was little,
on my birthday...
...my daddy would hide a present
to help me find them all.
I love family traditions like that.
When Ursula and I were kids,
on our birthday...
...our stepdad would sell his blood
to buy us food.
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, good!
We had this idea to make
a birthday video for Emma...
- ...and we'll give it to her when she's .
- Oh, cool.
- Wow, it's like a time capsule.
watching that video on a TV...
...that hasn't even been invented yet...
...with friends who, right now,
are just, like, babies.
And they'll be living in a floating city
that the humans built...
...to escape the ant people.
That's the hope.
- So is Emma awake yet?
- Where's Joey?
I said, it's still naptime.
- Hey, there's Uncle Joey.
- Hey.
Hey, say something to Emma
on her  th birthday.
- Eighteen, huh?
settling down.
Joey, will you please set this up
for people to put Emma's presents on?
Love to. Yeah.
- We were supposed to bring presents?
- Yeah. I wrote Emma a song.
Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, but for a  -year-old.
What's the point? The other day
she laughed for an hour at a cup.
Just a cup with a picture
of Elmo on it, dressed as a farmer.
And he's standing next to this cow,
- Hey.
- Where's the birthday girl?
- Oh, she's still napping.
She was probably up all night excited
about the party she knows is happening.
I know you guys really want to get to
will never have a first birthday again.
You're right. We're sorry.
Let's wake up Emma
and get the fun time started!
She didn't sleep well last night,
so we can't wake her.
Are you frigging kidding me, Greene?
- Hi!
- I can't believe Emma's already .
I remember your first birthday.
Ross was jealous of all the attention
we were giving you.
He pulled on his testicles so hard...
...we had to take him
to the emergency room.
There's something you didn't know
Let me help you with that.
- Thank you.
- Oh, man, this is great, huh?
The three of us together again.
You know what would be fun?
If we gave this present to Emma
- I know. What are we gonna do?
I've got a plan. I've got a plan.
I'm going to ram this platter
really hard into your ribs.
You're gonna scream out,
and that'll wake her up.
I'm not going to Vermont
since you wrote a song...
...maybe I could do something
for Emma using my talents.
So you're gonna hit on her?
No, no, no. My talents as an actor.
You know, I could, like, maybe....
I could do a dramatic reading
of one of her books.
Or you could stick a fork in an apple.
- Hey, I think Emma might like it.
- What did you get her?
- We prepared performances.
- Separate performances.
But equally real.
That sounds like fun.
People are getting a little antsy waiting
for Emma to wake up from her nap.
So would you mind
- Okay.
Okay. All right. Everybody,
let's get this party started.
Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform
a little something for us.
Oh, great.
Aren't you gonna be embarrassed
pointed at me and a whole crew waiting.
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
I will be doing a dramatic reading
of one of Emma's books.
Oh, okay. Which one?
Well, it's one of her favorites.
and very slowly rocked him...
...back and forth, back and forth,
back and forth.
And while she held him, she sang,
'I'll love you forever.
I'll like you for always.
I'll like you for always.
As long as I'm living...
...my baby you'll be."'
Oh, wow!
That was amazing.
Thank you so much for that gift.
I was not ready for this today.
- Amazing. Amazing.
- Phoebe, I'm sorry.
- Phoebe has prepared something as well.
- That's right.
I prepared a song for Emma,
than the gift of music.
<iEmma</i
<i>Your name poses a dilemma</i>
<i>'Cause not much else rhymes with</i> "<i>Emma</i>"
<iMaybe the actor Richard Crenna</i
Is that it?
No, of course not.
No, I've also, you know,
- Oh, no, no, no!
Hello, Emma. Happy  th birthday.
Right now, that seems
so far away,  years.
Yes. You'll be all grown up
by then, and we'll be....
Well, your grandfather and l
could be coming to you...
...from beyond the grave, Emma.
- After all, my parents died very young.
- And my cholesterol's off the charts.
Remember, Emma,
heart disease kills women too.
Okay, cut! Great. Great.
- Oh, good.
Ross, don't forget to get a shot
of Emma's cake.
- It's in a box in the fridge.
- Okay, sure.
You're gonna love this cake. I got it
the creamiest frosting!
I used to hitchhike there
when I was a kid.
Well, anyway, they make
these great novelty cakes...
...in all different shapes. And if you give
- Yes. On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Rach? Does this bakery
by any chance also bake...
...erotic cakes?
Say, for bachelorette parties?
Ross, what are you talking--?
Oh, my God!
They put my baby's face on a penis!
Now it's a party!
Wait, you guys, this isn't funny.
If I wanted this cake to be a disaster,
it looks delicious?
- Jack, look at this.
- I know what you're thinking, Judy.
The resemblance is uncanny.
I am this close to tugging
on my testicles again.
No, no, this is not what I ordered,
so that I could have the perfect cake...
...for my daughter's birthday.
And I need a bunny cake right now!
Ask them if it would be faster
if we cut the baby's face off the penis...
...so we could put it on the bunny.
That is a weird sentence.
Oh, believe you me,
Don't touch it!
I'm so confused!
Yes, I still want my daughter's picture,
but on a bunny cake!
Yellow cake, chocolate frosting
with nuts!
To be fair, this one does have nuts.
Mon, it was nice of you
- It was nice of her to pull my hair...
...till I dropped the key.
Well, while we're waiting,
you could tape your message to Emma...
...for her  th birthday, huh? Okay?
Hi, Emma. It's the year .
Are you still enjoying your nap?
We're Aunt Monica
and Uncle Chandler, by the way.
You may not recognize us...
...because we haven't spoken
together, and things kind of unraveled...
...because of you.
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks. Another good one.
I can't believe I taped over
Ross, Rachel promised
if we want to get to Vermont.
- The last train leaves in a half-hour.
- And I have a massage client soon.
You guys, just, please, a little bit longer.
I promise, Rachel will be back
with the cake any minute.
Monica, remember the frosting, huh?
All right, five more minutes.
Hello?
Oh, no, what happened?
Okay, okay, where are you?
Okay, I'll be right there.
Was that Emma? Is she up?
Rachel got pulled over for speeding.
She forgot her license.
- Wait, if anybody gets to go, it's us!
We've been complaining the longest!
No, wait, you guys.
No, you can't leave.
Rachel already feels bad
that the cake's messed up.
How do you think she'll feel
You make sure nobody leaves.
Got it!
Hey! Where do you think
you're going?
To the bathroom.
Well, the rest of you get comfortable,
because we are gonna be here for a--
- Wait, there's a window in there.
Get the hell out of here!
Well, that one did not have
Emma's face on it.
- No, it did not.
- No.
Well, we'd better get going. It's late.
Jack can't drive at night anymore.
and drove right through a manger scene.
The papers thought it was
a hate crime.
- Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
- Okay.
- Bye. Bye, dear.
- Bye.
- How could you just let them leave?
- Hey, hey, hey.
I'm not gonna mess with Jack. He's
a great man. He fought for our country.
No, he didn't. He pretended to be
I'm locking you guys in.
You do know I can just turn them
the other way around, right?
Oh, I forgot you used to live here.
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.
- Hey.
- The one I told you about last week.
What? You never said anything
about an audition.
Let me start over.
I just got a call about an audition.
It's down at the Astor Theater, and you
- No, wait! You don't get to leave.
I've got a massage client waiting
outside my door any minute.
And we paid for a room
that we're supposed to be in right now!
Well, okay, now...
...only one of us has to stay
who realized that, I get to go.
No, no, no. No. No.
Let's figure out a fair way
to decide who's staying.
Oh, I got it.
Okay, everyone pick a number from
one to , all right?
Whoever gets the highest number
- Okay, Monica picks . I call nine.
Anyone else?
- No, let's just draw straws.
- Okay.
Or we could flip a coin
and multiply the answer--
- I'm begging you to stop.
We got wind-up toys for Emma.
We can make them race,
and whoever comes in last stays.
Yeah, let's do that!
That sounds more fun than the thing
we were gonna do in Vermont!
- Okay, everybody, pick your toys!
- I'm too excited!
Phoebe, you get the bear.
Joey, you get the robot.
- Oh, yeah.
- And Chandler and I get the dog.
And the race is going to go
wind your toys.
- Okay. On your mark, get set, go!
- Go! Go!
Come on, robot!
What are you barking at?
Well, how is that gonna help?
I bought you! How did I forget
that that's all you do?
Way to go, robot!
Good job, Alan.
- Hey, good race, you guys.
to cross the finish line was the loser.
Well, our dog never crossed
the finish line. So technically--
They left.
There isn't time to go to the bakery.
We're gonna come home.
Everybody left?
All right. Well, just tell Emma that
- Oh, God, sorry!
I can't believe they gave you a ticket.
You're such a good driver.
- Emma's awake.
- Yeah?
I can't believe this.
This is her first birthday, she's awake,
this stupid obscene cake.
Hey, maybe I can fix that. You know,
try to turn it into something else.
Oh, don't even bother.
We've already ruined
her first birthday.
And do you know how important these
of that book that you gave me.
Rach, she's not gonna remember this.
I guess.
Oh, I just had such an idea of what
this day would be like, you know?
Emma laughing...
...and everybody gathered around
her cake, singing "Happy Birthday."
And then we would all-- Hey, get out
- What?
This is not bad.
Oh, my God. Look, you made it
into a bunny. How did you do that?
Well, I just made these
two things cheeks.
And then I split this to make ears.
Well, I am very impressed.
Some can sing, some can dance.
I, apparently, can turn phallic cakes
your stuffed animals is by size.
I'm sorry, is this a game
for Emma or for Monica?
Game?
Emma, do you even know it's
your birthday today? You're .
One year old. That's little.
That's my girl.
That's how old you are.
Did I teach her that?
Why don't we just take this one?
- And head to Canada.
- I was kidding.
I wasn't. Let's get going.
- Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
- No, not yet.
- Oh, good, I didn't miss the party.
slipped him a little something, you know.
As long as I'm back in five
or six hours, it'll be all right.
Okay.
If Ross and Rachel ask, I've been
here the whole time. The whole time.
I've been here the whole time.
Joey, we just saw you come in.
that you're here. Thanks, you guys.
Hey, guys, come on. You gotta see
what Emma just did.
- What?
- Emma, how old are you?
How old are you today?
Emma, that's right. You're that many.
Oh, my God, our daughter's a genius.
- This means--
stuffed animals lined up so neatly.
Thanks.
Okay, here we go.
Emma's first birthday cake.
Go ahead, Emma,
blow out the candle.
Come on, Emma. You can do it.
- What's wrong? Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, nothing.
These are happy tears.
This is just what I wanted.
Hey, you made it into a bunny.
What is wrong with me? It looked
- Yeah.
- And record.
- Okay.
<i>Big Brother</i> audition. Take one.
I guess you could say
I'm kind of a player.
Okay. Let's--
- Let's just try that again.
Well, your first birthday is over, and--
Go! Go! Come on!
Go! Go! Come on!
Go! Go, Alan!
Run, you hairy bastard!
You know, I'm thinking about letting
Emma have her first cookie.
Her first cookie?
- No.
No. And for the record, I've also
never given her frosting from a can.
Hey, Rach, the adoption agency
needs letters of recommendation...
...and we wondered
- Thank you.
I think there's been an oversight.
We would have asked you.
We thought you wouldn't be interested.
It's just that we don't think of you
as really being so much with the words.
Clearly, we were wrong.
I got a lot of nice stuff
to have a baby...
...and I would love to help you get one.
You know what?
Then we want you to do it.
Thank you. All right.
Let me see how I'm gonna start.
"Dear Baby Adoption Decider People...."
So excited about your letter.
- Hey.
- Yes, I do.
Today's Mike and my
one-year anniversary.
What's it the anniversary of?
Your first date, your first kiss,
first time you had sex?
Yeah.
So you must be going
anniversary before...
...so no matter where we go,
I'm wearing something fancy...
...I'm gonna put on
my finest jewelry...
...and we're gonna have sex
in our bathroom.
That's where people
make number two.
So, you know, I have
a little time if you want to....
I'd love to, but I really have
to a Pottery Barn catalog.
Well, it had some good ideas.
Take off your shirt.
- Damn it.
- Rachel, open up! It's your sister!
I have to talk to you.
Hi, Amy.
- You're not Rachel.
Amy, this is Charlie.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, hi.
And you are?
Ross? I grew up on your block?
We had Thanksgiving together
last year?
I had a baby with your sister?
No. I....
Did I buy a falafel
Here's your sister Amy.
She thinks I need pec implants.
Amy? Hi.
- You remember Joey.
- Yeah. Hey, sure.
- The <i>Days of our Lives</i> guy.
- That's right, yeah.
You are not good.
Always nice to meet a fan.
- So, now, what are you doing here?
- This is important. Can't Ella wait?
Her name is Emma.
Why did you change it?
Ella was so much prettier.
What do I know? I just sell
Middle Eastern food from a cart.
Hey, your English is getting better.
- Oh, my God.
I've ever hated.
- What you working on?
- Monica and Chandler's recommendation.
I want it to sound smart, but I don't
know any big words or anything.
- Why don't you use your thesaurus?
to change, go under "tools" ...
...and the thesaurus generates--
Gives.
Gives a whole list of choices.
You can pick the word
that sounds smartest.
My God, that's great. I'm smart.
No, no, I'm
"Brainy, bright, clever."
got the whole package!
God...
...so beautiful.
I know, isn't she?
No, I was talking about your bedding.
All right, what's your news, Amy?
Well...
...I'm getting married.
Wow! Oh, my God!
- To who?
- This guy.
He has a killer apartment.
- And...?
- And it's on Fifth.
And the elevator opens up
- Oh, he's okay.
Do you remember
my old boyfriend Mark?
- Yeah.
- It's his dad.
- Wow, so he's gotta be--
so he's hardly ever there.
Sweetie, I gotta tell you,
it sounds a little bit like...
...you like the apartment
more than you like--
Myron.
Yeah, I told you he was old.
Sit down. Sit down.
Honey, you know...
...l once also almost married
- Remember him?
God, we used to make out all the time
after you went to sleep.
Sometimes just nodding is okay.
But anyway, listen.
Not marrying Barry was the best
decision that I ever, ever made.
Honey, Amy, you deserve true love.
that is smart, that is fun...
...and that you care about.
You're right.
- You're right. I'm gonna do it.
- Okay.
I'm gonna marry Myron
and keep looking for Mr. Right.
Okay, let's keep talking.
Excuse me. Anniversary.
Excuse me. Anniversary.
Sir, could you move your nachos?
- I know.
This has been the best year....
- This has been the best year of my life!
- Me too!
I never thought I could
love someone this much!
I feel the same way!
You're so generous and kind,
<ito the big screen on the scoreboard.</i
<i>Someone has a special question to ask.</i>
How lame.
It's so tacky and impersonal.
- Really?
- It's the worst way to propose.
Excuse me.
I finished my recommendation. Here.
And I think you'll be very, very happy.
It's the longest I ever spent
too sophisticated for you?
It doesn't make any sense.
Well, of course it does.
It's smart. I used a thesaurus.
On every word?
Yep.
All right, what was
this sentence originally?
"They are warm, nice people
prepossessing <iHomo sapiens...</i
...with full-sized aortic pumps."
Yeah. Yeah. And hey,
I really mean it, dude.
All right, Joey,
I don't think we can use this.
- Why not?
sounding smart and just be yourself.
You don't need a thesaurus.
Just write from here.
Your full-sized aortic pump.
- Amy. Hi.
- I took your advice.
- I left Myron.
- Thank you.
So can I stay with you?
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
Look who's back.
Why do you have bags?
Why does she have bags?
I'm staying with you guys.
- What?
- We're gonna be roomies!
Come on.
- You slept out here?
yelling, "Myron, get off!"
But we're getting rid of her, right?
Please tell me we're getting rid of her?
- Joey, I can't do that.
- Oh, come on.
Last night I was finishing off
forever on the hips."
I don't need that kind of talk
in my house!
Joey, look, I know that she's difficult...
...but I think it's really good
that she's here.
Because we'll appreciate it
to this city, I was a lot like her.
I was spoiled, self-centered.
And you guys really took care of me.
Yeah. Monica made us.
Well, whatever.
I really appreciate it...
...because I don't think I would be
the way you guys helped me.
And I know it's gonna
take patience, but that's okay.
- Good morning.
- Yeah.
That's what I'm wearing today.
maybe now would be a good time...
...for us to sit down and,
you know, talk about your future.
Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go
get my eyebrows shaped.
I am not happy.
Sure you want to eat that?
I'm curvy and I like it!
- Hi.
Tell her about us last year.
Well, I bought Chandler a $ watch,
and he wrote me a rap song.
- Seriously?
- Word.
Mine was worse than that.
- Well, what happened?
on the big screen thing.
- That is so tacky.
- Well, that's what I said.
But it turns out Mike was planning to
propose to me that same way last night.
Oh, my God.
- Do you want to marry him?
Yeah, I really do. Yes.
But after I dumped on the way
he was gonna do it...
...l don't think he'll ever ask again.
I said no in Barbados, and now this?
She's right. If I were a guy and....
Did I just say, "lf I were a guy"?
You don't need him to propose to you.
Isn't that a little desperate?
I proposed to Chandler.
All right, moving on.
I don't think it was desperate.
It was amazing.
Thank you.
- Well, do you think I should propose?
- I think it could be kind of great.
Absolutely. You'll love the feeling.
So how should I do it?
How about at a game
on the big screen?
How about at a Foot Locker?
What? What, he obviously thinks
that's a nice way to be proposed to.
- Plus, he'd never suspect it.
- Sounds good to me.
But what would a guy think?
- Nana's on the phone.
- Wow.
That's interesting,
since she died seven years ago.
She did?
Who got her condo in Boca?
Hello?
It's our nanny.
Hi.
Oh, God, I hope you feel better.
- I can't. I have back-to-back classes.
Did Molly say what she had?
Because my throat's been hurting.
Menstrual cramps.
I don't think that's what this is.
- Can any of you watch Emma?
- No, I'm sorry, sweetie.
No, I've got work,
What am I gonna do?
Well, I could do it.
- Well, actually....
- Can I talk to you for a second?
I do not want her babysitting our child.
- Why not?
- For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella.
- Ella's a nice name.
- Okay.
I don't want her watching our baby.
Ross, I am trying to help her
become a better person.
This is a huge breakthrough for her.
She just offered to do something
for another human being.
You know, I don't know.
Ross, I'm telling you...
...she's giving up getting her eyebrows
that is in our world?
Listen, I couldn't help but overhear,
because I was trying to.
Listen, let me do this.
I really want to help you guys out.
And plus, Rachel's been
- Oh, great!
So how much does it pay?
How's the second draft
of the letter coming?
Great. I'm finished. In fact,
I just dropped it off at the agency.
- You dropped it off?
Can you print out another copy?
No can do, <iamigo.</i
No, I didn't use the computer.
It felt more personal to handwrite it.
- You handwrote it?
- Yeah, and don't worry.
I didn't try to sound smart at all.
See you later.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
one of those old couples...
...that collects orchids
or has a lot of birds.
It's okay. You know what?
I will just call the agency
and tell them to throw out the letter.
Okay, good.
Hello, this is Chandler Bing.
Someone just dropped off a handwritten
on the way to the bird store.
- They loved it.
- What?
They thought it was very smart of us
to have a child write the letter.
They thought Joey was a child?
She guessed , ,
- Hey, what'd you guys do today?
Ella wanted to go out, so we went
shopping and got some sushi.
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah, not really.
Babies are dull.
- Hey. Hi, how's my girl?
for letting me stay with you.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
You pierced her ears?
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
You pierced her ears?
How could you do this
without telling me?
If I had told you, then it wouldn't
Here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
Why, did something happen
to his falafel cart?
- Hey, guys.
- Ross!
Hi, Emma. Why is she wearing
- I don't really want her to see.
Why not?
Because there are so many
terrible sights in this world.
Like war. Or that thing
in Joey's refrigerator. Remember?
It was in a milk carton,
- Nothing.
Hi.
What--?
- Please tell me those are clip-ons!
- Oh, they're real.
Did she do this to her?
I told you we shouldn't have
left Emma with her!
I know, I know.
I am never letting you babysit again!
You know what?
This kid needs me, okay?
- She needs to have a cool, fun aunt.
- I'm a cool, fun aunt.
Okay.
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun
to figure out what to do with your life.
This is how you repay me?
I don't need you to help me. I already
know what I'm gonna do with my life.
- Oh, yeah? Since when?
- Since today.
I am going to be a baby stylist.
- What?
how to accessorize...
...what colors to wear,
what clothes are slimming.
- Babies don't care if they're slim!
- Enter Amy.
- Amy, l-- I just-- I just wanna--
- I'm not. I'm praying.
Please let the Knicks win.
Thank you, Thor.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Well, I think you should wait.
- Why?
Well, if you don't hold it in,
<ito the big screen on the scoreboard.</i
<i>Someone has a special question to ask.</i>
Mike Hannigan, will you marry me?
<iGet a load of this.</i
<i>She's proposing to him!</i>
<i>Guess we know who wears</i>
Well, that's not very enlightened.
Boo us? Boo you!
Odin will smite you!
Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani.
Oh, hi.
Well, I'm glad you liked my letter.
No, my mommy and daddy
She is moving out.
- You're kicking me out?
- You put holes in my baby's ears.
At least now people
will know she's a girl!
I can't believe I ever
- You know what?
Ever since I got here,
you have been nothing but negative.
- Excuse me?
- You didn't want me...
...to marry the old guy
de-emphasize her flaws...
...and suddenly I'm the bad guy?
- Joey, where are those bags?
- She has a lot of crap!
You know? When I moved in here,
I thought, "This will be so great.
Just us sisters back together again
- Ass and face.
Oh, my God!
I thought she was on Atkins.
She was. Carbs found her.
See? This is what I wanted.
Two sisters talking about real stuff.
Oh, I can give you that.
- You can?
- Yeah.
I kept trying to make you
version of what you are.
Thank you.
You gotta admit,
Emma does look cute.
- Did you just say, "Emma"?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Ella.
Sis, you wanna go bring Jill some pasta?
Come on, Amy. Now, that's just wrong.
Her true weakness was garlic bread.
That woman didn't know what
- I would love it.
- Consider it forgotten.
- Thank you.
But just so you know....
However and whenever you decide
to propose, I promise I'll say yes.
Whether, you know,
lame guy in a cheesy movie...
...who hides it in the cake.
It's in the cake, isn't it?
Where else would lame
Mr. No Balls hide it?
What's the matter with me?
Why do I keep ruining this?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
in these stupid ways...
...and I just wanna tell you I love you,
and I wanna spend my life with you....
- I'm gonna do this now.
- Oh, my God.
- Phoebe, l--
I would ask to marry me three times.
But I want to take care of you...
...have babies with you...
...and grow old with you.
Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
Yes.
- I love you.
- I love you more.
Not possible.
She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls!
So how's the baby-styling
business going?
Not that great.
It's almost as if people don't want
- Hi.
Pheebs, what's wrong?
I'm just so exhausted from dragging
around this huge engagement ring.
- Oh, my God.
- Congratulations.
So did he get on one knee?
and, like, the most romantic thing ever.
Here's to Phoebe, who's found
the greatest guy in the world.
To Phoebe and--
I want to say "Mike"?
- To Phoebe and Mike.
- Hey.
Thank you. Oh, and I have
the numbers of all the guys I've dated.
Oh, Phoebe, that's nice,
but you know what? I think I'm okay.
Give it to one
of your other single girlfriends.
I would, but you're the last one.
Give me the book!
"Pablo Diaz.
Brady Smith.
Guy in Van"?
Oh, my first love.
What is the red X next
in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
I should've given you guys
my black book when I got married.
Although, it wasn't so much
a book as a napkin.
With Janice's phone number on it.
Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
Oh, yes, they are.
Hey, honey.
Hey, sweetie.
- Is Monica not here?
for a big account, and they got it.
- It's my first national commercial.
- Cool.
And I don't want to brag,
but a lot of the ideas were mine.
Hell, you weren't there.
Hey, can you cast me in it?
I really don't think
you're right for the part.
What do you mean?
I can do anything. I'm a chameleon.
I'm old.
I'm tired.
Oh, I am hot. I'm cold.
The part's a stuffy college professor.
I can do that. Hello, I'm your professor.
When I'm not busy thinking
of important things, or professing...
...l like to use-- What's the product?
Software that facilitates
inter-business networking e-solutions.
I'm cold.
- Hey.
for a huge research grant?
I'll give you a hint.
He's looking right at you.
Well, unless it's the creepy guy
with his hand up his kilt...
...I'm gonna say, "Congratulations."
I'm so excited. Apparently, I beat out
I went to graduate school with.
Not that I'm keeping score,
or anything. Five.
- Wow, that's great.
- Yeah.
- So tell me about the grant.
to complete my field research.
And there will be an article about me
in the <i>Paleontology Review</i>.
It'll be the first time
my name is in there...
...without people raising
- Yeah. Why?
Benjamin Hobart
is administering that grant.
- Your ex-boyfriend?
- Yeah.
So your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine
help you. You know what?
Why don't we all go out to dinner,
and I can introduce you.
- If you think it'd help.
- Yeah, absolutely. I'll call him.
Now, is there anything
a pretty serious latex fetish.
We'll see how dinner goes.
- Hey.
- Hey, you want to go see a movie?
I told you I had to spend all day
clearing out stuff so Mike could move in.
- Oh, right.
with the cleaning and organizing.
I just happen to have my label maker.
Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff.
Did you and Chandler make compromises
when you moved in together?
Chandler did.
- What does he want you to give up?
- A bunch of stuff.
And the worst one,
Oh, I know. Oh, you should take her.
I don't know.
- What, you don't like her?
- Of course I do. What's not to like?
I'd take her in a minute.
But I think that you're
giving up too easy.
Honey, I think that you need
- Absolutely.
You say to him, "I'm sorry, Mike,
I can't live without her.
She means too much to me."
Okay, I'll fight for her. Okay.
Oh, wait. I just realized, if I do that,
that means you don't get her.
Damn it, I did not think this through.
Emma, mom's got a snack for you.
You know, every now and then,
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hey, baby.
Oh, any word on casting yet?
- I told you, you're not right for the part.
- What do you mean?
Rach, don't I seem like a professor
I'm never gonna be interested in.
Look, come on, please? It's not like
I'm asking you for some crazy favor.
This is what I do for a living.
I am a professional actor.
Man, I'm two hours late for work.
Here's my reel. It's got all
- Just watch it.
If you don't like it,
don't pass it on to your bosses.
- Fine.
- Thank you.
- Work, Joe.
- Just pass the tape along.
He's not right for the part.
If I suggest him,
my bosses will think I'm an idiot.
And that's something
they should learn on their own.
Just tell Joey
but your bosses didn't.
Then you're the good guy,
and they're the bad guy.
That's good. I liked it, they didn't.
Joey, for God's sake, go to work.
I can't believe I'm about
to meet Benjamin Hobart.
I've always thought of him
he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C-PO?
Sorry, it looks like it's just him.
Charlie.
My God, you look absolutely stunning.
Well, I am having a good hair day.
- It's so good to see you.
- Oh, you too.
I'm okay.
I'm sorry. Ross Geller,
Benjamin Hobart.
It's an honor to meet you.
I mean, that Nobel Prize.
I mean, I have to tell you that you're
one of the reasons I got into the field.
Well, likewise.
Not likewise. I'd never heard
of you until this morning.
But it's nice to be nice.
- Shall we?
this restaurant.
- Do you remember the night?
- Oh, my God. I completely forgot.
Oh, my God, I can't believe
they let us back in this place.
You weren't there.
No, but, you know,
in this restaurant with the....
Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your
proposal while I go to the ladies' room.
So tell me about it.
Okay. Well, I would like to do
a dig in the Painted Desert.
There are still several areas
- What?
What?
Did you just say,
"Break up with Charlie"?
Well, yes and no. Yes, I did say it.
And no, I didn't not say it.
- Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
all these feelings are rushing back.
I'm starting to realize
how much I've missed her.
And I'm gonna need you
to break up with her.
- Are you serious?
- Joking it is.
- Hi, sorry I'm late.
- Hey, how'd it go with Mike?
- Is he gonna let you keep the painting?
- No, he really hates it.
But he's gonna let me keep
But the good news is, Gladys is yours.
Wow, what's the bad news?
- Who's Gladys?
- Oh, she's that work of art I made.
You know, with the woman
coming out of the frame.
And Monica gets to keep her?
In her house? I am so jealous.
I didn't know you wanted her too.
Well, I mean, sure, of course.
But you already gave that
- No, I couldn't let you do that.
- No, but I want to.
- But I don't want you to.
- But I insist.
- But I insist harder.
Girls. Girls. Stop.
Tails, she's Monica's.
- Tails. Monica, she's yours.
- No, that landed in your food.
No, no, that's okay.
You won fair and square. I'm so sad.
Then the little red squirrel
and set off for--
Okay. Someone's getting a little fussy.
I think it's time for bed.
Where's the little red squirrel going?
Hey, Joe?
Oh, that's so sweet.
- What's up?
- Bad news.
I watched the tape and passed it along
- Yeah, I liked it.
But my bosses didn't go for it.
Stupid sons of bitches.
- You didn't watch the tape.
- What? Of course I did.
Look, it's one thing not to cast me,
- You lied again.
- I watched it.
- Keep going, Pinocchio.
- I did.
- No, you didn't.
I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
- Did you watch the tape?
can get this grant.
And I just wanted to wish
both of you the best of luck.
Are you crossing your fingers?
What, this? No. This-- That's just
the result of a childhood injury.
I'm cured!
Good morning, everybody.
If you go ahead and take your seats
can I have a word with you?
And you are?
- Ross.
- I know. I'm kidding.
Listen, I just want to say, last night--
Dinner was a little awkward.
- I just wanna make sure we're okay.
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
- You didn't tell Charlie what I said, did you?
I respect your decision not to give her up.
It was the biggest mistake
I ever made in my whole life.
Well, that and tattooing
her name on my shoulder...
...last night stupidly.
Seriously?
My Nobel Prize was not for moving on.
- So no hard feelings?
- Okay.
All right. The selection committee
has chosen the three of you as our finalists.
The ultimate decision will be based on the
answers you give to the questions I ask.
We're gonna go ahead
on the Linnaean taxonomic system.
How do you propose
to correct this problem?
Well, I believe that the answers lie
in the osteological evidence.
- I plan to begin there.
fieldwork. Where might that take place?
Primarily in the Pierre Shale region
of South Dakota.
Certainly. Very well.
And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?
What? I--
Care to venture a guess?
- May ?
graduate students will you need?
- Half a dozen.
- I see. And Dr. Biely?
Three for excavation,
and two for analysis.
Certainly. Dr. Geller,
a popular British lnvasion band?
What? I need six graduate students.
No, I'm sorry.
We were looking for "Baby It's You."
"Baby It's You."
What? Wait just a minute.
None of my questions have anything
to do with paleontology.
You're right, I apologize.
of a "Boscodictiasaur."
Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.
- Okay. B-O--
- No, it starts with a silent M.
Oh, come on!
I can't believe Joey.
I hate being called a liar.
But you are a liar.
What did I just say?
- Are you still here?
When I tell somebody I did something--
Okay, hold on, let me just stop you
right there, okay? First, you lied. Right?
Then you lied about lying, okay?
Then you lied about lying
about lying, okay?
So before you lie about lying
I didn't watch this tape?
You wanna know why?
You wanna know why?
Well, this is going well.
Here's how I know you didn't watch.
If you had seen what was on this tape,
believe me, you'd have some comments.
All right, remember,
you didn't watch the tape.
He really is a chameleon.
Well, Gladys, say hello
to your new home.
- Oh, my.
- Wow.
Oh, she is so nice and big.
Oh, Monica, where are you going
- How about right above the TV?
That way, it will be the first thing
that you see when you walk in the door.
Yeah, yeah, and you can get rid
of that French poster.
- I like that poster.
coming out of it.
Or maybe there's someplace
for her in your bedroom?
- There's nothing above your bed.
- Are you still here?
Stupid Nobel Prize winner.
Oh, hi. Hello.
Have you come to ask me some more
Ann-Margret's pant size?
I've come here to apologize.
I think I may have let my feelings...
...for Charlie interfere
with the interview process.
No. Stop.
Anyway, I decided
- There is just one small stipulation.
- I have to break up with Charlie?
- Hey, you got one right.
- You're crazy.
- Crazy or romantic?
Crazy.
- Or?
- Joey, what is this thing doing here?
I got her from Monica. She sold it
to me for a very reasonable price.
- Joey, we're not keeping this.
- But it's an original Buffay.
All right, fine. You can keep it.
As long as you don't mind
comes alive when you're asleep.
She climbs out of the frame...
...and then drags her half-a-body
across the floor...
...just looking for legs to steal.
And then with her one good hand...
...she slowly reaches up...
...and turns your doorknob.
Get that legless witch out of here!
- Hey, I sold that to Joey.
- Yeah, well, I told him it's haunted.
- Two can play at this game.
- No, you can't, she's yours.
- She's yours.
- She's yours.
- She's yours.
- Hey.
- She's mine.
- She's mine.
You guys, you don't have
to fight over her anymore.
Whoever doesn't get Gladys,
gets Glynnis.
- I want Gladys.
- She's mine.
No, no. You don't get to do that.
I know. Look, I'm sorry
I didn't give them your tape.
And I promise next time to submit you,
whether I think you're right or not.
That's not the point, Chandler.
gonna take for you to forgive me?
Oh, my God.
Excellent.
Now what do you say?
Lying is wrong.
And? And?
I'm a pretty little girl.
I knew it.
Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
- He is a character.
- No, no, no.
Charles Nelson Reilly is a character.
- Who?
- Charles Nelson Reilly.
- No. And you wanna know why?
Because your ex-boyfriend
is still in love with you.
- What?
- Yeah.
He refused me because
I mean, he broke up with me.
- And besides, he's a very ethical man.
- Really?
Is it ethical to ask someone
in a grant review:
"Who was the voice of Underdog?"
I'm sure he was just joking.
If you don't believe me,
one paleontological question.
- Seriously?
"How do you spell Boscodictiasaur?"
Well, if it's like the Lake Mbosco
in Congo, then M-B-O--
Damn it.
Dr. Geller. Charlie,
about the crazy questions you--
Wally Cox. That's the voice of Underdog.
Like I tried to tell you
in the interview...
...this grant is not based on your
knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
No, don't do that. I want you to look
but it's only because I still love you.
And I would do anything
to have you back in my life.
Too little, too late, Benji.
- I can't believe this.
- I never should've broken up with you.
I think about you all the time.
- What?
I don't know what to say, Benji.
This is all so...
...romantic.
Or?
I know I may be
way out of bounds here...
...but is there any chance
to make me a little uncomfortable.
Oh, God. I am so sorry, but--
I mean, there's so much history
between us, you know?
I'm sorry too.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Okay, that's it,
Man, this does not get old.
- You're mean!
- Oh, don't be such a baby. Please.
Hey, you guys.
Hey, what are you doing?
- Figuring out our wedding plans.
The hall, the dress, the food.
- I had no idea how expensive this was.
- Yeah, it is really pricey.
- I freaked when I heard the numbers.
- So, what did you two do about it?
It was simple. I came up with
and Monica told me to go to hell.
There's no way around it. Just accept
that this is gonna cost a lot of money.
I heard that weddings are, like,
a $ billion-a-year industry.
Yeah. And I'm responsible
to spend on one day.
Hey, I've been married before,
I don't need a big wedding.
All I ask is that you don't do ecstasy
and make out with my brother.
But really, it does seem like
of Amway products.
- Or give it all to charity.
- Oh, that's great.
How am I gonna unload
all those Amway products?
Are you serious?
Yeah. How would you feel if we gave
wanna marry you even more.
I gotta say, you guys,
that's an incredible gesture.
Maybe you do that
next time you get married.
No, no, no. The next time's
- Hey.
Our adoption social worker is coming,
so we're cleaning the apartment.
"We"?
You know you don't want me to help.
You can't have it both ways.
Is this the person who decides
- And it has to go perfectly.
If she doesn't like us, she can keep
us off every adoption list in the state.
Hey, maybe I should stop by.
She could be a soap opera fan.
It's very impressive when
somewhere, like porn or cigarettes?
What?
- No.
- Chandler.
I don't, and I'm offended
by the insinuation.
So there's not a magazine
of the toilet tank...
...or a filthy video in the VCR?
I'll admit to the cigarettes and magazine.
But that tape is not mine.
- It isn't mine.
- I guess we'll never know whose it is.
May I help you?
Yes. We're here to make a rather
is appreciated.
I think you're gonna appreciate
the crap out of this one.
- Well, this is very generous.
- And we don't want any recognition.
This is completely anonymous.
Completely anonymous.
in our newsletter.
- Not necessary.
- Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
And X is spelled "Mike Hannigan."
Attractive Couple Makes World Better.
Well, on behalf of the children,
- It does. It feels really good.
Oh, look. And we get these free T-shirts.
Actually, that's the shirt
I wore to the gym.
It's moist.
- Hi. Emma will be up in a minute.
- Oh, good.
Hey, Ross, listen. I heard about
other beautiful paleontologists out there.
- Absolutely.
- There was one. She's it.
All the rest look like
they should live under a bridge.
So, what are you gonna do today?
I was thinking of taking Emma
Emma to the Museum of Knives and Fire.
Okay, look, Ross. I do not want
Emma going to the playground.
Because...?
All right, if you must know,
I had a traumatic...
...swing incident when I was little.
- Seriously?
got tangled in the chain.
And to get me out, my mom had
to cut a big chunk of my hair.
And it was uneven for weeks.
And you made it through that?
I wonder who's gonna play you
in the movie.
Okay, fine, you can make fun of me.
about your tragedy.
But the swings are perfectly safe.
And besides, Emma loves them.
- You should come, and you'll see.
- Those things go, like,  miles an hour.
And there's that moment
if you're gonna return back to Earth.
Space is filled with orbiting children.
Look, please, just come on.
When you see the look on Emma's face,
I swear, you won't regret it.
- All right.
- Good.
You don't wanna be a mom who passes
out about a spider in your apartment.
That's the same. I'm sure there are 
different species of poisonous swings.
Oh, my God.
The adoption lady is early.
Okay. Okay. Here we go.
But I'm glad you're here.
I was cleaning this morning
and I found this.
I don't know
if you wanna use it, but....
Oh, this is so sweet of you.
But I won't be needing a veil.
to a naked wedding!
No. We're not having a big reception.
We took the wedding money
and donated it to a children's charity.
That's crazy!
- Generous.
- Crazy generous.
I'm sorry. I can't imagine giving up
I don't care about having a huge party.
This is really nice for you, but....
Oh, please. I put this on
and I just look like--
Well, radiant.
All right, but who cares? I don't need
a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
That's right.
whether you do it at the Plaza or....
- Where you gonna do it?
- City Hall.
Oh, that sounds nice.
I was just there for jury duty.
They've really spruced that place up.
Okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
is a great big wedding.
- But you gave all the money to charity.
- Well, I'll just ask for it back.
- I don't think you can do that.
- Why not?
This is her wedding day. That's way
something for the adoption lady.
- All right, okay. Be careful.
- Okay.
Careful. Watch her hair.
Watch her hair!
- Rach, she's got, like, three hairs.
Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
I promise you she's safe.
Watch how much she loves this.
- Okay. Okay.
- Are you ready, sweetie? Here we go.
Okay, careful. Okay.
She's smiling.
Look at that, she does like it.
See, I told you.
Oh, my God. Look at her,
- Oh, absolutely.
Oh, God. Okay, get the camera.
It's in the diaper bag.
Okay.
See? Scared of the swings.
I bet you feel pretty silly.
- We're asking for the money back?
Because one of us has to start flirting.
You here to make another
donation the same day?
I don't think that's ever
happened before.
Gay. Go.
Oh, my God, I love your shirt.
The donation we made earlier?
we thought we didn't want.
But it turns out we do.
So you're asking us to refund
your donation to the children?
Yeah.
This feels really good.
I'm sorry. I am. But this wedding's
just really important to me.
Hey, it's none of my business.
what with all the food and warm clothing.
That's not fair.
A person's wedding is important.
And especially to me.
I didn't have a graduation party.
And I didn't go to prom.
And I spent my sweet 
in his own words, wanted to
"Kill me, or whatever."
So I deserve a real celebration.
And I'm not gonna let some sweaty
little man make me feel badly about it.
She could've been talking about
either one of us.
Okay. Here we go.
Good luck.
Tongue, really?
Hi, I'm Laura. I'm here
And this is Chandler.
- Please come in.
- Thank you.
- Would you like something to drink?
- Water would be fine.
We're so glad that you're here.
We're excited about
Love them to death.
Well, not actually to death.
That's just a figure of speech.
We love kids the appropriate amount...
...as allowed by law.
- Your place is just lovely.
- Thank you.
Yes, this building does have
other couples in the building adopting?
Is that that couple on the first floor?
We should get a baby before them.
That guy tried to sell me drugs.
But other than that,
wholesome, wholesome building.
- What?
- Oh, it's nothing.
I went on a date with a guy who lived
in this building. It didn't end very well.
That wouldn't, by any chance,
be Joey Tribbiani?
- Yes!
he promised he'd call and he didn't.
Rat bastard!
- So you're not friends with him?
- Oh, God, no.
- No, no, no.
- No. Nope.
Well, I'm sorry I brought it up.
So are either one of you planning
order a celebrity?
What was that?
That's just some crazy guy
who roams the halls here.
He's great with kids, though.
- Ross. Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Son of a bitch!
Oh, relax. I didn't say the F-word.
Ross, see, I told you!
one of those things for her entire life.
No, no, no. Okay, it wasn't
the swing's fault. It was my fault.
And kind of that kid's fault.
Who is still laughing. Nice.
Come on. Can we just get out of here
before somebody else gets hurt?
No. Wait. I have an idea.
nothing to be afraid of.
I know what this is all about.
You've always been jealous of my hair.
I just think you're an adult, okay?
And you should get over your silly fears.
- All right, fine. I'll do it.
- Good.
- If you hold a spider.
It's me, Joey.
Adoption!
What's going on?
Oh, it's just like I said, that crazy...
...Bert, roaming the halls.
- Guys?
- Keep on roaming, Bert!
We don't want any crazy today!
Is he all right out there by himself?
Oh, yeah. He has a caretaker.
His older brother...
...Ernie.
- Bert and Ernie?
- We'll talk later! Everything's fine!
Everything doesn't sound fine.
Bert and Ernie have a big yellow bird.
You never told me about that guy
and your sweet .
- I'm sorry about that.
- Oh, it ended okay.
One of my friends shot him.
At least you'll get a proper wedding.
I had nothing growing up.
Just like the kids
I took the money from.
No. No, no. I see where this is going.
Don't make me go back there.
I'm sorry, but I want to regive the money
you called that guy a sweaty little man.
Unless you were talking about me.
We never really cleared that up.
Look, I can't have a wedding
with this money now. It's tainted.
Fine, we'll give the money back.
If that guy at the charity
in a really long time.
I must say this seems like a lovely
environment to raise a child in.
You are welcome to look
under any of the furniture...
...because, believe me, you won't find
I have everything I need up to here.
Why don't I show you the baby's room.
- What are you doing?
- You wouldn't let me in.
- I thought you were in trouble.
- Well, we're not.
But you called me "Bert."
That's our code word for danger.
- We don't have a code word.
will be our code word for danger.
So that was the baby's room.
- What room should we see next?
- Any room that isn't behind this couch.
Some people don't get him,
but I think he's really funny.
I did not care for that.
You have to leave.
You slept with our social worker
so she can't see you.
Okay, okay.
- What?
- I forgot my bat.
Oh, my God.
And for the last time,
we do not want to be friends with you!
And we don't wanna buy your bat!
What are you doing here?
Bert. Bert. Bert. Bert.
- Are you friends with him?
coming back here.
- I can't believe you never called me.
- Excuse me?
You probably don't even remember
my name. It's Joey, by the way.
And don't bother telling me yours,
You never called me.
Don't try to turn this around on me.
I am not some kind of social work...
...that you can just...
...do.
- I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.
- Really? Think about it. Come on.
You're a beautiful woman.
Smart, funny.
We had a really good time.
If I had your number,
You broke my heart.
You know how many women
I had to sleep with to get over you?
- Joey, wait--
- No!
I waited a long time!
I'm so embarrassed.
- Oh, that's really okay.
- Yeah. We totally understand.
- Dating is hard.
- Boy, you people are nice.
And I've got to say...
...l think you're going to make
looking for is an ATM.
No, no, we're here
to give the money back.
Yeah. Because you know what?
It's all about the children.
Although it's also about the wedding.
All right, here. No. Oh, God.
If I haven't said so already,
and we keep half?
Or, no, like,  percent for us
and  percent for-- Or, no, like, -.
Okay, you know what? Enough, all right?
I'm stepping in
and putting my foot down.
As your future husband,
- What?
On behalf of the children of New York,
I reject your money.
- But we're giving you this.
- And I'm giving it back to you.
Come on. Consider it a contribution.
Well, this is very generous.
Take the check. Have a great wedding
come back in a few years...
...and make an even bigger donation.
And when you do, ask for Brian.
- Oh, is that you?
- No.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
Oh, my God, really?
I can't wait to tell Chandler.
Okay. Goodbye.
- Wrong number?
we're officially on the waiting list.
- That's great.
- Now we just wait for a call...
...and someone tells us
there's a baby waiting for us.
Hello?
Have you seen Joey's bat?
Okay. I got a spider.
There were two,
- Okay.
This feels perfectly normal.
Okay, get on the swing.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
- See?
- All right. I can do this.
There you go. Good for you.
You know what?
I'm getting used to this little guy.
- I don't even feel him in here anymore.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hey.
We need to talk about something.
Yeah. We don't feel like we can
host Thanksgiving this year.
- What?
and the stress of adoption...
...we don't feel like
we have the energy.
Plus, we don't think it's fair
that every year the burden falls on us.
That doesn't sound like you.
That's Monica talking.
- No, we made this decision together.
You put turkey in people's mouths.
I can't believe this.
This is Emma's first Thanksgiving.
- No, it's not.
- It's not? When was she born?
Well, personally, I think it's great
- Sure. It's just as well.
I mean, last year wasn't very good.
I think she's losing her touch.
- What? You are way off, lady.
- Am l? Really? Am l?
Well, why don't you cook
to top what you did last year.
You'd be in competition with yourself.
That's my favorite kind.
Okay, we are doing this.
Don't let yourself
get manipulated this way.
Stay out of this, Chandler.
This is between me and me.
We are supposed to make
the <i>Dr. Phil</i> I taped for you?
- Hey.
- Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy Meatless Turkey-Murder Day.
You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies
from that bakery on Bleeker.
- Could you pick them up for me?
I entered this pie-eating contest.
I ate so many that the
thought of them makes me sick.
Did you at least win the contest?
Two minutes, twelve pies
and a part of one tin.
- Okay, I'll see you guys at .
In your face, last-year me.
- Hey, Rach?
- Yeah.
What's Emma doing today?
Well, let's see, I know that she has
a meeting with her lawyer...
...and then she has to make
- I want to enter her in a baby pageant.
Oh, my God. That's the creepiest thing
I've ever heard.
Okay, but before you say no,
my friend Suzanne is entering her kid.
And compared to Emma,
- Oh, okay.
No. Phoebe, just the idea
of pitting one baby against another...
...l mean, you know, and judging
who's cuter just for a trophy...
- And a thousand dollars.
on the inside is important.
Okay. And Emma needs
a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
Where am I gonna get
a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
Well, I was thinking--
Take the clothes
from Kansas to do that?
I don't get older, I just get better.
You know what just occurred to me?
This could be our last Thanksgiving
just the two of us.
I mean, we could be getting a baby soon.
- You don't know that.
- Somebody's gonna pick us.
But we haven't heard a thing
me and little Hemingway Bing.
- What? He's my favorite author.
- Name one of his books.
<iThe Firm</i?
Okay, let's see. Okay, the turkey's
in the oven. The stuffing is ready.
You know, you always cook this meal
Dr. Phil tells you to do.
I'm serious, let me do something.
Just not the turkey. Nothing high-profile.
Okay, let's see. Oh, the cranberry sauce.
It's easy to make,
and no one really cares about it.
Tell me more.
I'm gonna go check on something across
my Palmolive potatoes.
- Hi. Hey, guess what Joey has.
- Three tickets to today's Rangers game!
Dude, I wanted him to guess.
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, they're great seats too.
- Guess where they are.
- So?
- Dinner's at . We'll never make it back.
- So we'll leave before it's over.
But it could take us
a long time to get back home.
Plus, Joey could get lost and they could
been working hard all day.
She didn't want to host
in the first place. We shouldn't go.
He's right, man.
- Yeah, I guess. So we'll see you at .
- Okay.
And get ready to taste
- Yeah.
<i>This is contestant number ,</i>
<i>Rebecca Hope from Yonkers.</i>
- Hey.
- Phoebe, listen, I think we gotta go.
This place is freaking me out.
I've been watching this guy over there.
who was favored to win...
...she got croup,
so she had to stay home.
This competition
just blew wide-open, folks.
Phoebe, it's just too weird.
I just saw a  -year-old
been more prepared.
It's okay. Now, the way I see it,
our real competition now is Cameron.
My God, they just took her sweater off.
Look at those arms.
Hello, Michelin Man.
Phoebe, come on.
to Emma's group yet. We got dinner.
But Emma's got what it takes.
She could go all the way!
- Phoebe, you have to calm down.
- Okay.
Rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state
not one of them holds a candle to Emma.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- You heard him say that?
- Yeah.
All right. Okay. All right, let's give
Emma needs some makeup.
What?
She's gonna look washed-out
next to the others.
No, I'm not letting you
put makeup on my baby.
- Why not?
Get off the ice, you idiot!
- What a game.
- I know. Yeah.
- I can't believe Chandler's missing this.
- I'm sorry he's not here.
But I gotta say,
if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
- Yeah!
- These seats are great.
I know, I know.
When I was here for "Holidays on lce" ...
...l was sitting so far away,
leave now, we're gonna be late.
But it's a tie game. So we're
a little late. The girls will be there.
Let's just stay for one more goal.
- I don't know.
- One more fight.
- Okay.
They're  minutes late.
I can't believe they're not here.
I slave and I slave for what?
They've ruined Cranberry Day.
- How late are we?
- Forty-five minutes.
- Here.
so they probably started without us.
We could just slip in, and no one
needs to know where we were.
- You may want to lose the foam finger.
- Oh, no, no, no.
You just want to put it on your hand.
- You're not at Thanksgiving?
- We're late too.
We figured we could be late
because you'd be on time.
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani.
- Nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us.
- Yeah, where were you?
- Well--
Thanksgiving Day spelling bee?
Yes. Y-E-S. Yes.
Let me see this. "Grand Supreme
Little Darling, New York Division"?
That's me.
You entered Emma in a beauty pageant?
And it looks like she put makeup on her.
Wait a second. Where have I seen
that cowgirl outfit before?
I can't believe this. She's our daughter.
That you would treat her like
- So this is an annual thing?
That's Alicia May Emory's outfit!
Guys, there are people in there
who are not getting any happier.
- What are we gonna do?
- I gotta put Emma down for a nap.
And, Rach, while you're in there,
- We'll say that we were mugged.
You can't get mad at someone
who's been mugged.
Good. But you don't look
like you were mugged.
No. Here.
Hey!
Do you hear something?
- They're out there.
and they're just standing there talking.
Everything's so distorted.
It looks like Joey has a giant hand.
That says "Rangers" on it.
They went to the game.
Oh, they are in for a world of pain.
- Ross' shirt is torn.
What happened to your shirt?
I got mugged, and they stole my pocket.
We're just trying
to figure out an excuse.
How about this?
not . That way we're right on time.
Or we could plant PCP in the
of all the PCP we have lying around.
We'll just say that she said it was .
We'll just act casual.
We're not late, we're right on time.
"We know you're out there."
Who do you think it's from?
Oh, God, this is bad. This is so bad.
Well, let's just go in there
and face them.
I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on
It's like a bolt of lightning.
Why don't we play Rock, Paper, Scissors,
and whoever loses, goes in first.
- All right, I'm in.
- Ready.
I win.
- What is that?
Well-played.
All right,
let's all go in at the same time.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- It's locked.
on the couch, it's like
"Come on in,
my butt is surprisingly hairy!"
All right, come on. All right, you guys,
we're so sorry we're late.
Please let us in so we can have
dried out and the stuffing's all soggy.
Yeah, and there's a bowl
of cranberry sauce that's--
What happens to cranberry sauce?
- Nothing, it's fine.
- Oh, thank God.
Come on, you guys, we're sorry.
I can see Joey's hand.
For the love of God, take it off!
Guys, it doesn't matter
why we're late. We're all here now.
Please let us in so we can have
some of your delicious turkey.
I had a dream once
- Water balloon!
What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
I just remembered,
we do have something to eat.
Monica put something
in our oven this morning.
You touch that,
The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it!
Oh, my God, it's Brussels sprouts!
That's worse than no food.
All you got was Monica's
stinky Brussels sprouts.
Stinky?
Please let me stay
on this side of the door.
Oh, I know!
They don't wanna be with us.
I don't wanna be with them either...
...but it's Thanksgiving, and we should
not want to be together together.
If I could just get in there,
make a face-to-face apology...
...look them in the eye,
- I'm telling you...
...l can do it.
Yeah, he can do it.
It all looks so beautiful.
- The turkey, the stuffing.
- The cranberries.
Enough! A monkey could've made them.
Hey, listen, guys,
we feel really terrible.
He's doing that weird eye-contact thing.
Don't look at him. Don't look at him.
Come on, you guys. We want
- Oh, so sorry.
But let's not ruin this day.
You've worked so hard.
Let's move past this and try to have
a nice meal all together, huh?
The floating heads
- So bad.
Okay.
Okay, you two go get the dessert,
and I'll let you in.
Dessert?
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up
the pies. You did remember, right?
Pies. Oh, we thought you said "prize."
Here.
- "Grand Supreme Little Darling"?
Well, I cannot believe this.
You forced me to make dinner,
you're an hour late...
...and you forget the one little thing
that I asked you to do.
Really, girls, not cool.
Well, you man-heads aren't any better.
and you went anyway.
Hey, I'm getting a little tired of this.
We said we're sorry.
It's Thanksgiving, for Pete's sakes!
A day of forgiveness.
- It's a day to be thankful.
I don't need your stupid dinner.
That would be a lot more convincing
if you weren't drooling.
- Oh, is that what that is?
- Sorry.
Come on, you guys,
- Yeah, let's go out.
Yeah, you three
have a nice Thanksgiving.
- The three of us?
- Yeah. You, Chan and the vein.
- I'm stuck.
- I'll pull you through.
Okay.
Stop, stop, I'm worried
about damaging my head.
It's a little late for that.
Hurry up, you gotta do something.
All right, well,
this does not change anything.
We need to get something
- Bring it.
I just want to say that I'm sorry I referred
to the vein as a separate person.
Here you go.
Oh, that smells good.
- Okay?
- Okay, try it.
It isn't working.
- We're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
- Oh, I left them on my bulldozer.
I don't have tools.
- Well, I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
- I lent them to Ross.
- I gave them to Joey.
- I left them at the park.
I'm finding it really hard
down his pants.
Nice.
Okay, I have to get that.
Now, when I get back,
I want you and your friends to be gone.
Thanksgiving is over.
The vein has spoken.
- It's really starting to hurt.
enough room to wiggle him out, okay?
Okay, so push.
Just a sec. We're kind of
in the middle of something here.
Hey, stop putting things
down my pants.
- Come on, guys, push!
- Man, I got food all over me.
I can't believe what you did.
Monica's gonna kill you.
Look! Look! Look what the--
Look what the floating heads did!
I don't care.
What's going on?
That was the adoption agency.
And?
- We're getting a baby!
and she picked us.
- Oh, my God, that's great!
- That's incredible.
I'm so happy for you.
This Thanksgiving
kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
To Monica and Chandler
are finally getting a kid.
I know. Have you considered pageanting?
I can't believe they called.
I mean, we're actually getting a baby.
I know how you feel.
- Really?
- Sure.
I went through the exact same thing
I get that call from Toys"R"Us.
She was in stock.
That is the exact same thing.
Hey, Emma, you better
appreciate this while it lasts...
...because when you get older, you're not
gonna be able to just sit around all day.
- So true.
- Hey.
We're here to say goodbye.
We're off to Ohio.
Oh, right, your adoption interview.
Yep. We'll meet the lady
who could be carrying our baby.
I can't believe it. When you come back,
but might not like us.
Come on, she's gonna love you guys.
Thank you. But we're trying
not to get our hopes up.
A lot could still get in our way.
She could decide against adoption,
like another couple better.
What are you gonna name it?
I could develop a condition in which
What if everything goes right?
What if this woman does pick you guys?
Oh, my God. She's gonna pick us!
So we're standing firm on
"not getting our hopes up"?
No. I know things could still
go wrong, but if they don't...
...if this works out,
- Oh, my God. It's gonna work!
We're gonna make it work!
I'm gonna be a mommy,
and you're gonna be a daddy!
All right, I'll see you suckers.
I'm gonna go get me a baby!
Screw it. I'm gonna be a daddy!
Hey, who's Phoebe with?
Mike.
No, Joey.
I'm gonna have sex with."
- Hey.
- Hey.
- So who's your friend?
- Oh, that's Sarah.
No. Don't you get any ideas.
I'm not setting you up
- Because you'll date her once...
...sleep with her, then forget she exists.
Name one friend of yours I did that with.
- Mandy.
- Mandy, huh?
Really hot blond, big boobs?
- No.
- Might be why I don't remember, huh?
Do you think I'm someone else?
Look, I may not have treated
Really. Honest. Rach?
Yeah, believe it or not, it's true.
I mean, when Joey
and I were together...
...he was wonderful.
He was thoughtful and mature.
And for the one week
- Okay. Thank you.
And I promise you
I will not forget this one.
- Mandy.
- Sarah!
Sarah.
- Hey.
- Hey, guys, I need some fashion advice.
How does this look?
Well, it's-- It's a little low.
Pick it up a little.
A little bit more.
A little bit more.
There you go.
Now throw it away.
Come on! This looks good.
Ross, please trust me.
I buy  fashion magazines a month.
Now I don't know who's running
have to get far away from that hat.
Damn it. God....
I have this date tomorrow night,
and I have to look cool.
- Well, who's the girl?
- Her name's Joan.
She's in fashion.
you said she was in fashion.
At the Ralph Lauren offices,
that would've killed.
If you want fashion help, Rachel and l
are going shopping tomorrow.
- You're welcome to come with us.
about how I dress.
I can see why. Nice shirt.
You're wearing the same shirt.
Stupid Gap on every corner!
Make yourselves comfortable,
and I'll be back with Erica.
Okay, thank you.
Well, this is it.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just weird, you know?
It's like, "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have
I'd like you to meet Erica.
- Hi.
- Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
- Hi.
- Thank you for agreeing to see us.
- Hi.
- So it's Monica and Chandler?
I only know you as
"File CRW -D."
That's what our friends call us.
Gosh, you know, you're just
such an amazing couple. It's...
...kind of intimidating.
I don't know about that.
Are you kidding me? I mean,
you're married to a reverend?
- I don't think that's exactly--
- Let her finish, doctor.
- Hey.
- Hey.
My friend Sarah
- Yeah, so you gonna call this one back?
No.
What are you talking about?
Sarah's great.
Oh, really? You want to know
what your "great" friend did?
We're out to dinner, okay?
We were getting along,
go out with her again?
So she took some fries. Big deal.
Hey, look, it's not about a few fries.
It's about what the fries represent.
- What?
- All food!
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't believe I set you up
with such a monster!
Hey, look, I take a girl out...
...she can order whatever she wants.
and then eat my food!
That's a good way to lose some fingers.
- Thank God you're here. Listen to this.
- What?
Joey and my friend are out last night,
having dinner, and she reaches over...
- ...and takes a few of his fries--
Joey doesn't share food.
I mean, just last week
we were having breakfast...
...and he had a couple grapes
on his plate.
- You wouldn't let her have a grape?
not to call someone again.
You are calling her, okay?
And if you need to, then just
get an extra plate of fries for the table.
I like that.
A sharing buffer. Yeah.
Yeah, I'll order some extra fries.
Maybe a plate of onion rings.
Yeah. Yeah.
And a shrimp cocktail.
And some Buffalo wings.
Maybe....
Everyone is so mean.
So fun.
We should just go.
I'm not gonna find anything here.
This stuff is ridiculous.
Oh, this place is great!
Okay, you guys have fun.
I'm gonna go talk to people in this voice.
Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear
- Okay, nothing with hair.
And nothing with padlocks on it!
Ross, look. Look, I know that some
of this stuff is out there.
But I mean, come on, look at this.
Look at this sweater.
I mean, this is just beautiful.
Wow, this is really soft.
Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Down from .
a serious hit today.
Hey, check this out. It's totally you.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
Wow. Actually, this looks pretty good.
Yeah.
"Boys will be boys"?
- What? They will be!
- All right.
- That's it, I'm getting out of here.
nice shirts, these nice pants.
Actually, these might look
pretty good on me.
Yes, they will. You know what you
should do? Go take a walk.
All right? I know your size, and I'll
- Yes.
I know what looks sexy on guys.
Just wear what I suggest,
and she is gonna go nuts for you.
So you're saying...
...if I wear these pants,
I might be getting into hers?
Why do men keep talking to me like this?
So the fact that I'm a doctor
than a minister to raise a child?"
Amen.
Plus, I thought the baby would be
in good hands with a doctor.
Good hands.
Healing hands.
Reverend, can I ask? Does the Bible
say anything about adoption?
It says, "Do it."
"And behold, she did adopt
- Yeah, wow.
I was wondering--
You both have such serious jobs.
Would you have time to take care
of a baby and your flock?
- My flock?
takes care of themselves by this point.
Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
But being a doctor,
that must take up a lot of time.
Not for me it doesn't.
So how's everything going in here?
We're great. I think
I may have asked all my questions.
Good. Do you have questions for Erica?
Yeah, actually. So you read
the serial number and they contacted us?
Yes. Our system ensures
total anonymity.
- We're very proud of it.
- You should be.
You're really on top of stuff.
Well then, if there's nothing else,
- We don't?
Yeah, when I read about you two,
I was pretty sure I wanted you...
...but I just thought
we should meet face to face.
I've made my decision.
I choose them.
Oh, my God, this is great.
This is so great. Did you hear that?
Yeah, I did.
Hey.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You are so going to heaven!
- We got some really great stuff.
about some of the bras I got.
Really? Do you want to try
some of them on for me?
Okay.
Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bags
by mistake.
And one of mine is missing.
Ross probably has it.
the same shirt anymore.
Yeah. Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me.
She told me to trust her,
and you know what? I'm glad I did.
I turned quite a few heads
on my way over here.
Dude, I really don't think
competition with the ladies?
Looks like someone is the ladies!
You're just jealous because
you couldn't pull this off.
Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a date.
See? All eyes on me!
- We are not signing those papers.
They think we're somebody else.
God works in mysterious ways.
You have got to stop.
But she liked us.
She likes Doctor Chandler
and Reverend Monica.
If you think about it,
I'm kind of like a reverend.
I mean, as a chef, I serve God
we've been given an opportunity.
The mistake's already made.
They're writing up the papers now.
But we're not the ones she chose.
How can you feel okay about this?
Because.
We may not be who she thinks we are...
...but no one will ever
love that baby more than us.
- I know.
for someone else to give us a baby?
What if no one ever picks us?
Oh, honey....
Please?
Please. We are so close.
Monica, I want a baby too.
But this woman is giving away her child.
She deserves to know who it's going to.
Okay. You're right.
So we'll tell the truth.
And who knows, you know?
Maybe she'll like us for us.
Maybe she will.
Why couldn't I have been a reverend?
You're Jewish.
Technicality!
Garden salad for the lady.
Oh, that looks great. Good ordering.
Seafood platter for the gentleman,
and extra fries.
Enjoy.
Those fries look delicious.
I didn't know you liked French fries.
Help yourself. What's mine is yours.
Wow, are those stuffed clams?
Yes, they are my stuffed clams.
How about those fries, though, huh?
- They are delicious.
take food off of my plate, okay?
But you said, "What's mine is yours."
Well, I didn't mean it!
Fine. Sorry, I didn't think
it was that big a deal.
No, I'm sorry. I....
I'm overreacting, okay?
It's just, when it comes to food, l...
...have certain rules...
...okay? I mean...
...there are things you do, and,
And I'm so glad we're finally doing this.
- Me too.
- Here.
So this was fun.
I really am sorry about,
you know, before.
And I want to make sure you
sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
Yes, that's a raspberry coulis.
Coulis is not a monkey?
When I read the description I thought
it came with a little raspberry monkey.
- Oh, my God.
- I'll just have what she's having instead.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
trying to be healthy.
Oh, no.
This is work. I should call in.
Can you excuse me?
Yeah, sure. No problem.
What are you doing?
I thought you don't share food?
Sure I do.
Coulis?
No. If I can't have your clams,
when I come back.
Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
Stop staring at me!
Just a tiny little....
I'm not even sorry.
- Hi.
- Hey.
So these are the preliminary forms
for an open adoption.
There's a lot to go over,
- Yeah.
It's a sonogram they took
of the baby last week.
I thought you might want to see it.
Look, doctor.
Look, before we sign anything,
we really have to talk.
We're not who you think we are.
- I don't understand.
and I'm not a doctor.
- What?
- That's impossible.
I could perform an operation on you
and prove it if you'd like.
I have to check your file. Excuse me.
So who are you?
Our names really are Monica and
to know about us...
...is how much we would care
for this little baby.
So you lied to me before?
Well, we "bore false witness."
See? I could be a reverend.
I can't believe this.
But we were hoping that
since we told you the truth...
- ...that you still might consider--
my child after this?
You don't have to decide now.
If you look at our file--
I don't want to look at your file.
This is over.
Erica, wait.
I have nothing to say to you.
Look, you have every reason to be upset.
We did lie.
But only because we've been waiting
be before we get another chance.
Why don't you ask the reverend
to pray on it?
Erica, please.
Just consider us.
Ask them to see our file.
Our last name's Bing.
My wife's a chef, and I'm in advertising.
Oh, yeah.
I actually liked you guys.
But it doesn't matter.
but the woman's always right.
I love my wife more
than anything in this world.
And it....
It kills me that I can't give her a baby.
I really want a kid.
And when that day finally comes,
I'll learn how to be a good dad.
But my wife...
...she's already there.
She's a mother...
...without a baby.
Please?
You still want that baby?
God bless you, Chandler Bing!
Turns out this sweater
the two of us tonight, huh, buddy?
Yeah. And you know what?
We could do a lot worse.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Joey doesn't share food!
This cake is amazing!
My God, get a room.
I would get a room with this cake.
I think I could show
you give up, food or sex?
Sex.
Seriously, answer faster.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
But when she said "sex,"
I wasn't thinking about sex with you.
It's like a giant hug.
Ross, how about you?
Which would you give up?
Food.
How about sex or dinosaurs?
Oh, God.
What about you, Joe?
I don't know! Oh, God, I want both!
I want-- I want girls on bread!
- You gotta see these pictures of Emma.
- Oh, how cute!
- She looks just like a little doll.
- Oh, no, that is a doll.
Oh, thank God,
you thought Ross was trying to kill you.
Well, sorry, but it's hard to believe
that anyone would tell a story that dull...
...just to tell it.
There's something going on with them.
Look! He's getting into the car with her.
That doesn't mean anything.
Oh, yeah? Well, let's see.
Okay, duck down.
- Hello?
...so I was wondering if you wanted to
I'm stuck here at the office all day.
Well, it's a shame
that you'll miss the movie...
...because we were gonna see,
Those are all really old.
Okay, then maybe it'll be--
- What?
and follow them.
Yeah, okay. Let me just grab my
night-vision goggles and my stun gun.
I got them.
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi, sweetie.
Hey, you smell like
- Nancy doesn't smoke.
Well, at least the perfume's not mine.
Be thankful for that.
So.... What did you think of the house?
It's everything we've been looking for.
Isn't it? And what about
the amazing wanes coating...
...the crown molding
- The fireplace in the bedroom.
And Nancy said it's really underpriced...
...because the guy lost his job
and has to move in with his parents!
This is bringing out a lovely color in you.
So do you think we should get it?
I don't know. What do you think?
- I think we should.
- I do too.
This is huge. How bad
giant, talking cigarette.
Phoebe called as I was getting
into Nancy's car.
If she asks you, I was at work all day.
Got you. When do we tell them?
We don't. Not until it's  percent.
Why upset everybody over nothing?
Okay. Right.
- Oh, my God, that is gonna be so hard.
them out to a house in Westchester.
They went in for  minutes, and then
they came out looking pretty happy.
Chandler?
Forty-five minutes?
Well, something's not right.
So you went all the way
to Westchester, waited  minutes...
- ...and came back in a cab?
to pitch in  bucks, that would be great.
I can't believe he'd do this to Monica.
I know, and with the baby coming?
- So should we tell her?
- I don't know.
If one of us saw Mike with another
woman, would you want us to tell you?
Why? Who'd you see him with?
- No one. I'm just saying if we did--
It was hypothetical!
All right. He is a good guy.
You're right. He wouldn't cheat.
If I did see him with someone,
there's no way l--
Who did you see him with?
Oh, look at her. So happy.
If only there were a smaller one
to clean this one.
Hey, is Chandler here?
No, he's picking up dinner.
we're here for you, and we love you.
- All right.
- Chandler might be having an affair.
- What?
- Phoebe and I saw Chandler...
...with a blond woman today
to a house in Westchester.
They went in together. I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that's awful.
What did you think of the house?
What?
Monica, you understand
what we're saying, right?
Yeah. Sure. I mean,
I'm devastated, obviously.
Did you think the neighborhood
- You son of a bitch.
Is it me, or have the greetings
gone downhill around here?
Phoebe and Rachel
saw you with Nancy today.
They think you're having an affair.
- Who's Nancy?
- Yeah.
I'm not having an affair.
Nancy is our realtor.
I knew he couldn't be
with a woman for  minutes!
Why do you have a realtor?
She's been showing
us houses outside of the city.
- What?
that we were gonna get this baby...
...Chandler and I decided
we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
So you're-- So you're gonna move?
Oh, my God.
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?
What is wrong with raising
a kid in the city?
I'm doing it. Ross is doing it.
Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
And that's great for you guys,
can ride their bikes...
...and maybe an ice-cream truck
can go by.
So you want to buy a house in the 's.
Have you thought about
what you're giving up?
You can't move out of the city.
Chinese food at  a.m.?
Or a fake Rolex that breaks
as soon as it rains?
Or an Asian hooker
sent right to your door?
You know what? If you want
I'm gonna thump you.
It's okay, because they have
to get it out of their system.
Okay? But you're gonna realize
this is the only place you want to be.
Actually...
...we already found a house we love.
- What?
having an affair now, huh?
- You put an offer on a house?
- It's so sweet.
It really is. It has this big yard
that leads down to this stream.
And then there's these old maple trees.
Oh, again with the nature.
and we're really sorry.
Is this because I come over here
without knocking and eat your food?
Because I can stop doing that.
I really, really think I can.
You know that's not the reason, Joe.
I think if you saw it, you'd understand.
You guys were there.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.
out there today, all I kept thinking was
"l can't believe Chandler's
screwing this woman...
...but, man, this would be
a nice place to live!"
Yeah, but so is this.
Yeah. I mean, if you move there,
always told me, "You're a shoe!"
"You're a shoe! You're a shoe.
You're a shoe!"
I stopped and said,
"What if I don't want to be a shoe?
What if I want to be a purse?
Or a hat?"
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
here with Monica.
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.
Your money's mine, Greene.
Your fly's open, Geller.
You know what I just realized?
"Joker" is "poker" with a "J"!
Coincidence?
That's "joincidence" with a "C"!
Look! Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.
That had to hurt!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.
Instead of watching football,
the marshmallows in concentric circles.
No, Mon. You want to put them
in concentric circles.
I want to do this.
Every year.
It's stuck!
Step.
How did it get on?
I put it on to scare Chandler.
Oh, my God! Monica's going to
totally freak out!
Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Of course it smells bad.
get rid of the rooster.
That's interesting!
If you win...
...we give up the bird.
But if we win...
...we get your apartment.
- Deal!
- What?
"Monica's nickname
when she was a hockey goalie?"
- Big Fat Goalie.
it's her favorite movie."
<i>Dangerous Liaisons</i>.
- "Her actual favorite movie is...?"
- <i>Weekend at Bernie's</i>.
"Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?"
- Everyday use.
- Fancy guest.
- Two seconds.
- Eleven?
Unbelievable!
Eleven is correct.
"Chandler was how old when he
- No, .
Thanks, man.
"Joey had an imaginary
childhood friend.
- His name was...?"
- Maurice!
- "His profession was...?"
You need this or you lose.
Something to do
with transponding.
He's a transponster!
That's not even a word!
You are mean boys
who are just being mean!
Don't get mad! No one
She forced me!
You got the question wrong.
It was a stupid, unfair question!
Don't blame the questions!
Stop yelling in our apartment!
You are ruining moving day for us.
Chandler!
I saw what you were doing
in the window!
I saw what you're doing to my sister!
Four, five months?
That's more than most people
have in a lifetime. Goodbye.
Hey, Ross.
What's up, bro?
What the hell are you doing?
What's going on?
I think Ross knows
This is my sister!
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!
We're not just messing around.
I love her.
I'm in love with her.
I'm so sorry that you
I love him too.
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!
This is the last box of your clothes.
I'm just gonna label it
"What were you thinking?"
I was gonna go across
the hall and write that on Chandler.
Guys, I don't wanna make
Rachel anymore.
You're so mean to each other.
I don't wanna end up like that
with Rachel. I still like you.
That's fine because I'm not moving.
Phoebe, you gotta take her.
I said some bad stuff...
...but Rachel has qualities
that make her a good roommate.
She gets tons of catalogs and folds
to read in the bathroom.
When I fall asleep on the couch...
...she covers me with a blanket.
Well, you know,
I don't want you to be cold.
And when I told her that I was gonna
move in with Chandler...
...she was really supportive.
You were so great.
You made it so easy.
And now you have to leave.
And I have to live with a boy!
- She really left.
- No problem, roomie.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
What the hell is that dog doing here?
A little toast here. Ding, ding!
This isn't exactly the kind of
Thanksgiving you planned...
...but for me this has
involve divorce...
...or projectile vomiting.
If you had gone to Vail...
...or if you had been with your
family, or if you didn't have...
...syphilis and stuff...
...we wouldn't be
all together.
So I guess what I'm trying
of your Thanksgivings sucked.
- That's so sweet!
- Thank you.
Here's to a lousy Christmas!
And a crappy New Year!
- Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear!
You can't move. You just--
This is where you guys belong.
You don't wanna live in Westchester.
That's the worst of the Chesters.
You know, sometimes when I'm alone
in my apartment, I look over here...
...and you guys are just having dinner...
...or watching TV or something...
...but it makes me feel better.
And now when I look over,
Just stay here...
- ...and maybe close your blinds at night.
- Hey.
Hello?
It's Nancy. They responded to our offer.
And?
Okay. Thanks.
They passed.
They said they won't go a penny
under the asking price.
- We can't afford that.
that phone call didn't come...
...before I told you about looking
through the window.
Yeah. Well, we're gonna
let you be alone.
- You gonna be okay?
I wasn't more supportive before.
That's okay. We understand.
Yeah, and about this Nancy....
If you're not sleeping with her, should l?
I know there'll be other houses,
but I just--
- I love that one so much.
- Yeah.
Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
- What?
- I didn't wanna tell you in front of them.
We got it?! We got the house?!
We're getting a house!
- We're getting a house.
- And a baby.
We're growing up.
We sure are.
- Who's gonna tell them?
- Not it!
Not it! Damn it!
Rachel, this is yours.
Why? What are these for?
- You'll see.
I was looking at in the store!
- I know.
- Oh, I love this!
A meatball sub!
Thanks!
Seriously, guys, what's going on?
What are these for?
Well, I didn't know
- Enjoy!
What did they say?
- Hey, guys--
- Wait! Let me tell them.
- Sure.
- Joey's gonna be...
...a celebrity guest on a game show.
Really? Which one?
Fish. Seaweed.
- A sunken ship.
- Yeah.
- That was our favorite game show ever.
- Except for <i>Match Game</i>.
Or <iWin, Lose or Draw</i.
What did I marry into?
You guys wanna come
and watch me tape the show?
Oh, we can't. We're throwing Phoebe
college alumni thing.
I can't believe you get
to meet Donny Osmond.
Seriously?
Ross and I always wanted to be
Donny and Marie.
You guys just keep getting
for our family and friends.
Oh, God, that's right.
I blocked that out.
I'm leaving you.
It's so weird to see
all these people again.
Oh, my God, look. There's Jeffrey Klarik.
- Who?
You gotta remember her.
Sure. Nice.
Dude, you're married to my sister.
You're right. By saying "nice,"
I'm virtually licking her.
Hey, I hear she's single again.
You think I should ask her out?
Are you asking permission
the fliers for the band.
- I made them on a Macintosh.
- Awesome.
The name really stands out.
Thanks to a little something called
Helvetica Bold -point.
Man, we're gonna rock
- Hey, Missy.
- Our band is playing on Friday.
- Yeah, you should come check us out.
We're called Way/No Way.
- No way.
- Way.
- Great. I'll be there.
- Mint.
- She's gone.
- I know it.
- I am totally gonna ask her out.
- Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
- I said it first, bro.
- Wait! Wait! What are we doing?
What we have is too important
to mess it up over some girl.
I mean, we can get laid
any time we want.
Totally.
- I had sex in high school.
with Missy Goldberg.
You got it.
That's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates
and Molly Ringwald...
- ...who we can't go out with.
- Those are the pacts.
And Sheena Easton. But we probably
to break the pact.
Thank you.
Here I go. Hey, remember how scary
it used to be going up to girls in college?
- Your hands are shaking.
- I know. And I can't stop sweating.
Five, four, three. Applause.
Yeah!
Welcome. It is Soap Opera Week
Gene Lester is a database specialist.
He's gonna be playing with
<i>Days of Our Lives</i> star Joey Tribbiani.
And over here,
we have Henrietta Cherry.
I know it can be intimidating for
only better-looking and richer.
She'll be playing with star of
<iGeneral Hospital</i, Leslie Charleson.
Welcome, everybody. Good luck
All right? Now, we flipped a coin
so you'll start. Which category?
- "You Crossed the Line."
- "You Crossed the Line." Joey...
...describe for Gene these things
that have lines.
Give me  seconds on the clock,
I'm writing in my....
- Diary.
- No, more like a notebook.
If I'm building a house, the plan...
...isn't called a "shmooprint" ....
I can't do that either?
In high school, I once had sex
with a girl right in the middle of the...?
- Cafeteria?
- You like it?
Oh, my God, it's all so elegant.
When's the dirty stuff starting?
- What?
- The strippers and the guys dancing...
...and, you know, pee-pees flying about.
Pheebs, l.... There isn't gonna be
any "flying about."
We thought we were
This is all there is. Just tea. Okay.
Raunchy.
Seriously, Pheebs, it's not gonna be
that kind of a party.
Really? So this is...?
This is my big sendoff into married life?
Rachel, this is the only
bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have.
I've got a big wad of ones in my purse.
Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?
No.
- Phoebe, of course there's more.
my Band-Aid in their scone?
That wasn't an apricot?
- What's the problem?
- Okay. Phoebe wants a stripper.
I thought we said
we were too grown up for that.
Yeah, well, it's what she wants.
Hey, why is the page
all six of these to stay in the game.
Describe for Joey
"things you find in your refrigerator."
They might as well
just give us the points.
Give me  seconds on the clock.
- A spoon. Your hands. Your face.
- It's white.
- Paper. Snow. A ghost!
- It's heavier than milk.
- A rock. A dog. The Earth.
Pass.
- You put it on a sandwich.
- Paper. Snow. A ghost!
- It's made from eggs.
- Chickens?
Pass.
- You put this on a hamburger.
- Ketchup! Relish!
Stop!
Oh, time's up. Well, Joey, you were...
...almost on a roll there. Gene...
...you'll have a chance to go to
Circle to try your luck for $ ,...
...right after this. Don't go away.
And we're out.
- How about that ketchup thing, huh?
- Yeah. Impressive.
Oh, so we didn't win.
But it's fun to play the game, right?
I got a kid starting college.
we'll do better next time.
Well, I will, because I won't be
playing with you.
Hey, some of those are pretty hard.
Like, why would there be
a ghost in my fridge?
Yeah.
- So Saturday night?
to ask me out?
Oh, well, this is gonna sound
kind of silly...
...but do you remember
my roommate, Chandler Bing?
Sure. He was in your "band."
It's been  years,
- That's okay. Anyway....
Well, he and I both
really liked you a lot...
...but we didn't want it to jeopardize
our friendship, so we made a pact...
...that neither of us could ask you out.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- We'd go to the science lab after-hours.
- And on my turf?!
Hey, where is this guy?
It's been over an hour.
He's coming from Jersey. He said
found an earring in cucumber sandwich.
Well, it's not mi--
I am not on my game today.
- Who is it?
- It's the police.
The police!
That's right. It's Officer Goodbody.
What's the matter, officer?
Has someone been bad?
That's a lot of stairs.
Boy.
You should warn people
that Mexican food for lunch.
Are you gonna be okay, Officer...?
- Goodbody.
- If you say so.
So where's the young lady...
...who I am supposed to take
downtown?
Oh, God.
You, my dear, are under arrest.
Cardiac arrest?
All right. Somebody show me
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Rachel?
- Yeah?
- Are you kidding?
We didn't know you wanted a stripper,
- How old's your phone book?
Oh, my God, this man is gonna
get naked in my apartment.
God, no. I don't wanna see him
take his clothes off.
Are you talking about me?
No.
I mean, obviously we wanna see you
can I have your attention, please?
Oh, yeah.
Did someone call
for the long arm of the law?
I should warn you,
I have a concealed weapon.
I hope you're familiar
Where's my hat?
Look, I've been in this business
for a long time.
Shocking.
Now, if you'll just pay me my $,
I'll be on my way.
- $? Are you kidding?
He didn't do anything.
Didn't do anything? I took a bus
all the way from Hoboken.
I climbed, I don't know,
like, a billion stairs.
And it's not like I can
We're not paying you $ for this.
It's not my fault if you're
too uptight to appreciate...
...the male form in all its glory.
Okay, I'm uptight. That's why I don't
wanna watch a middle-aged guy...
...dance around in what I can only
from my nephew...
...but let me assure you,
what's underneath is all man.
I'm sorry, did you say "all man"
or "old man"?
You're mean.
- Look, officer-- Sir?
The hunk of beef has feelings.
Applause.
Okay, Henrietta, you picked
"Jack and Jill Went Up The Hill."
My friend Rachel has a kid.
I totally know nursery rhymes.
Joey, describe these things associated
on the clock, please.
Ready? Go.
Pass.
Pass.
Pass.
- The thing hanging in your throat.
- Uvula.
Then pass.
Okay. Henrietta, you didn't get
all the points you needed...
...so that means, Gene, you are going to
with Joey Tribbiani.
Pass.
Nope. You must be thinking
of someone else.
I was never in a band.
You made out with Missy Goldberg?
How could you do that
after you promised me?
Excuse me.
That didn't make us sound gay at all.
- You broke the pact.
about the foundation of our friendship.
I believe the foundation of our friendship
was unfortunate hair.
If we're really gonna do this, it's not
like you never broke one of the pacts.
- I didn't.
- Oh, really?
- No.
- Adrienne Turner.
Yes?
- Hey, Adrienne.
- Hey, Adrienne. Hey.
I never did anything
how much I liked her.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Really? Remember
that party freshman year?
A week before Christmas vacation? I do.
You had some visitors.
I can't believe we're
at a real college party.
I have to pee so bad.
This is so awesome.
College guys are so cute.
- Hey, you've got a boyfriend.
wants to kiss me, I am so gonna let him.
Hey, look, there's Chandler.
That stupid friend of Ross'
who said I was fat.
- I've already lost four pounds.
- You can so totally tell.
I know!
Well, let's see,
- Yeah, Rachel.
And this is Ross' sister, Monica.
We met at Thanksgiving.
Right. So how you doing?
Bitchen.
- Hi, Monica.
- Hi, Chandler.
It's really nice to see you. Not!
Okay.
I'll see if I can find Ross.
Oh, my God, Rach. Beanbag chairs.
Do not let me sit in one of those.
you can't tell Chandler about this.
Oh, believe me, Ross,
I won't be telling anybody about this.
Cool.
No way.
I didn't know you knew about that.
Well, I did. And it hurt.
That's when I wrote the song
"Betrayal in the Common Room."
That's why that song had
and you made out with Missy.
Well, I guess we're even.
We are even, right?
One more thing. I was so pissed at you
that night, I wanted to get back at you.
So I thought, "Who does Ross
like more than anybody?"
What did you do to my mom?
Not her.
I am so drunk.
That's weird. I've had the same number
Maybe even five with all the dancing.
- Somebody order a pizza?
- Oh, that's me!
I am so not gonna do good
on my SATs tomorrow.
Well, maybe you could go to school here
my smart pills now.
Well, maybe you could get in
on a beauty scholarship.
What a line.
- So where are you applying to?
- Well...
...l think it's kind of really important
a -year-old stripper cry before?
You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding?
I should have hung up
that breakaway jockstrap years ago.
Half the time, it just pops off by itself.
Maybe now is a good time
for cake and presents.
What am I gonna do? I mean...
...this has been my life for  years.
Taking my clothes off
that you can do.
I mean, what skills do you have?
I don't know.
I can make my pecs dance.
I can pick up a dollar bill
with my butt cheeks.
I can go to that special place
inside me where I feel no shame.
So maybe something in an office.
Or you could-- You could teach stripping.
You know, share your gift.
that's not a bad idea.
I could do it out of my apartment.
I don't think my mom would mind.
There you go. Okay.
You think you're gonna be okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.
your last dance.
And I didn't even get a chance
to finish it.
Finish it.
- What?
- Your last dance. Do it for us.
- Really?
the thing he loves one last time.
Okay. All right. Get ready, ladies.
Okay.
Oh, this is so hot!
Oh, no, don't stop.
Have to.
I am so sorry that you have
to do this with me.
Listen, I know this won't
put your kid through college...
...but would you like
three, two....
Applause.
Welcome to the Winner's Circle.
Joey, Gene, you guys ready?
- Yeah.
- Sure.
Okay. Give me  seconds
I don't know any Spanish words.
A match. A candle.
Things that go
when you put them out.
A torch. A bonfire.
- Your pee.
- Things that burn.
"I'd like to go for a walk."
- Pizza toppings!
Cindy Crawford. Christie Brinkley.
Heidi Klum.
Claudia Schiffer. Christy Turlington.
Kate Moss.
Girls Chandler could never get?
- Supermodels.
You kissed Rachel.
Ross, she was so drunk
she didn't even remember it the next day.
Plus, I should tell you,
it did not last long.
Hey!
I'm in college, and I'm in a band.
Yeah, okay.
And now I've killed one.
Hey. Where's Rachel?
She and Phoebe took the stripper
went off just as planned.
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
What? When was this?
Last week. We had some wine and....
You don't know I'm kidding.
.
The weekend you guys
visited me at school.
- Oh, my God. That's wild.
- But it was, like, a million years ago.
- It doesn't matter.
- Because the night you kissed Rachel...
...was the night I kissed Rachel
for the very first time.
- You kissed her that night too?
- Two guys in one night?
Oh, I thought she became a slut
- Okay...
...after you told me she was
passed out in our room...
...l went in there to make sure
she was all right.
She was lying on my bed,
I accidentally got her lips.
I started to pull away, but then
I felt her start to kiss me back.
It was only for a second,
but it was amazing.
And now I find out
- Mine.
- I'm sure I put her on my bed.
- No, she was definitely on my bed.
Why would I kiss a girl
and then put her on your bed?
Well, then who was on my bed?
No! No!
Yes!
- You were under the pile of coats?
a lot nakeder.
Oh, hey, Joey.
- Hey.
- Listen, I need to ask you something.
You know how my stepdad's in prison?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
He was supposed to get a weekend
exercise yard couldn't wait till Monday.
- So he can't come?
- No.
And so there's no one to
walk me down the aisle. And....
Well, I would just really love it
- Yeah.
You've, you know,
sort of been like a dad to me.
You've always, you know, looked out
for me and shared your wisdom.
I am pretty "wisdomous."
So, what do you say?
Are you kidding?
you mean to me.
Listen, I hope....
I hope that you know....
I don't want you to see your father cry.
Go to your room!
Oh, no, no, no. Let your dad get this.
It's my wedding planner.
She's driving me crazy!
Hello? Okay, stop screaming!
Okay, so halibut.
All right, so salmon.
- Well, it matters to me!
Well, I don't care. So you pick.
Did you just hang up on me?
All right, look, I need you at the
rehearsal dinner tonight at  hours.
Okay. What time is that?
You don't know military time?
I must have been in missile training
the day they taught that.
Just subtract .
Okay, so  minus ...
...is .
- Six o'clock!
by . Goodbye.
How hard is it to make an ice sculpture?
Harder than it looks.
Wait. Ice sculpture?
That sounds really fancy.
I told you, I just want a simple wedding.
Please, honey, leave the details to me.
Now, I wanna make this day
as special for you as I can.
I was thinking the harpist
is playing the steel drums.
- Oh, she backed out.
- She did? Why?
I made her.
Steel drums don't really say
"elegant wedding."
- Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
- You too.
I'm glad we're having a rehearsal dinner.
I rarely practice my meals before I eat.
What did we say
was your one gift to us?
No stupid jokes, but I thought
- Oh, yeah--
I was....
I was going for a handshake.
That why your hand's
against my crotch?
- That is why.
to my mom's.
Apparently, babies and weddings
don't mix.
Are you still crying about
your damn baby?
Pheebs, you got to keep the line moving.
of your wedding planner.
I wanna throw a really tense party.
- Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
- Yes, we are.
Our little ones
are growing up fast, aren't they?
- How's that?
On the other, it's hard to let go.
How do you want
to divide up the holidays?
I was thinking Thanksgiving at my place,
Christmas at yours.
Who in God's name are you?
I'm not that fond of you either, buddy.
we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
I thought we'd be groomsmen.
They would have asked us by now.
When did they ask you
to be a bridesmaid?
- November.
- Sorry?
You haven't told these guys
what they're doing in the wedding yet.
Well, they're not in the wedding.
What?
Well...
...this is really awkward.
Oh, and I can leave.
I'm sorry, you guys. But Mike's got
his brother and his friends from school.
So, you know, you were....
If it helps, you were next in line.
all over again.
I mean, synchronized swimming.
I mean--
I mean, the balance beam.
- Help me.
- Football.
Thank you.
Oh, Pheebs, spit that out.
were supposed to be vegetarian?
Yeah, I changed them.
I sent you a fax about it.
I don't have a fax machine.
Well, then there are gonna be
a few surprises.
I can't believe we're gonna be
- And it's a wedding.
It'll be weird if I'm not in it.
- Hey, guys, how's it going?
- Fine.
We're sitting here, alone, doing nothing.
It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
Look, about tomorrow,
had an emergency and can't make it.
- What happened?
- Who cares? And...?
And I was wondering
if one of you guys--
- I'll do it!
There's only room for one.
Pick me. I look great in a tux,
and I won't steal focus.
No, Mike. No, no, you wanna pick me.
I mean.... Watch.
You know, I really don't feel
I'm gonna let her choose.
Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say
hello to Mike's next groomsman.
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror...
...as he is me.
- Please. You're going down.
- You are going "downer."
They say that on the
for Phoebe's stepdad tomorrow, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
- Oh, hey, my pleasure.
So, what are your intentions
with my Phoebe?
- I intend to marry her.
your wife by playing the piano?
Isn't that kind of unstable?
- No more so than acting.
- Strike two.
You're right.
She probably will support me.
Hey, unless we move in with you, Dad.
Strike three.
You only get one more, Mike.
- Michael, can I see you for a moment?
- Hey.
What's with the face?
That Mike has got no respect.
I'm not sure about him.
Wait, that's not him. There he is.
So? What did you decide?
I decided to pee.
You have to choose one of us
to be in your wedding.
- One of the groomsmen fell out.
I love you both so much.
Just not enough to put us
in the original wedding party.
Such bitterness.
Best to keep that attitude
in the seats.
Come on, Pheebs. We both really want
It's....
Okay, wait. Rach?
Listen, I have a very special
bridesmaid task for you to do.
Goody! What is it?
Well, there's a spot open
for only one groomsman...
...and you have to choose between Ross
No, I don't wanna do that.
I guess I have to find a new bridesmaid.
I'll do it!
Okay, it's  hours.
- Time for your toast.
- Do I have time to go to the bathroom?
You had a bathroom break at .
Pee on your own time, Mike.
In regards to the toasts, okay,
like long speeches. Okay.
You just get in, do your thing,
and get out.
Is that what you say to Chandler?
It's , and I am not amused.
Okay.
The bride and groom
have a few words they'd like to say.
Okay. Hello, everyone.
And thank you all for being here tonight.
and I didn't get off to the best start.
Yeah. My friend Joey and l...
...decided to fix each other up
with friends. So l--
Oh, okay. I....
I thought about it, and I fixed him up
with my friend Mary Ellen...
...who couldn't be here tonight,
Well, she's in rehab.
Anyway. So Joey said that he was
fixing me up with his friend Mike...
...only he didn't have a friend Mike,
so he just brought my Mike.
And-- And--
But despite, you know--
my mother, who couldn't be here.
Oh, God.
And.... And moment's over.
So okay.... Oh, no, forget that.
I can forget that. Oh, this is funny.
Oh, but you need to know that
to get that.
So....
Oh, well, okay.
I.... Okay.
Okay, Monica, I can't do it like this!
This is my wedding, okay?
to the bathroom any time he wants!
- You know what? You're done.
- What?
You're fired!
Cheers.
- Hey.
- Happy wedding day.
Happy my wedding day to you.
Joey, listen, this is gonna be
in the bathroom.
I had to move a couple things in the
fridge to make room for the corsages.
Man! I wouldn't have had breakfast
if I knew there was gonna be corsages.
Hi.
About last night....
I know you're under
were a little hurtful to me...
...as someone who's never
been fired before--
What about in high school...
...when that yogurt store let you go
for sampling toppings?
Everyone there did that.
Yeah, but did everybody owe  grand
if you're just here as a bridesmaid.
Is that so?
Okay.
If that's really what you want,
then here.
I give you the headset. I don't really
wanna give you the headset.
I guess if you're taking over, then you
I have won awards...
...for my organizational skills.
But I'm sure you'll do fine.
- You've won awards?
- I printed them out on my computer.
- Hey.
- She's in her room. Why?
I have to talk to her
about this groomsman situation.
I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there
while I'm in the seats like some chump.
This wedding isn't about you.
It's not? Then who's it about?
Well, it used to be about me,
chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
Ross, please don't make this
harder than it already is.
I'm not. I'm making it easier. Pick me.
Chandler said it's important to him too.
I'm sorry, did you and Chandler go out?
Do you and Chandler have
a huge history, huh?
Do you and Chandler have
freak you out, wouldn't it?
Listen. Listen.
Whoever you pick is gonna
walk down the aisle with you.
Now, I promise I won't say a word.
But if you pick Chandler...
...he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes
until I talk to him.
- You got it.
- Okay.
I cannot believe you played
the Emma card.
Oh, please. I was prepared
And I didn't hold out.
You know, normally,
that would hurt my feelings...
...but today, I'm a groomsman.
Sven, I don't understand what you're
saying. What is wrong with the flowers?
"Lorkins"? What the hell are "lorkins"?
I know.
- Hey.
"lorkins," what flower would that be?
- Orchids?
- Right there!
That's why I'm marrying you.
Hello, Michael.
Joseph.
May I have a word with you, please?
You wanna step it up there?
This is...
...great.
Have a seat.
Last night...
...l tried to welcome you into my family.
And instead, you disrespect me.
I cannot allow this.
Are you rehearsing
for some really bad Mafia movie?
More back talk.
And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines
<i>This A-Time It's A-Personal.</i>
Joey, I kind of have a lot to do today.
What do you want?
I want you to take this seriously!
Phoebe is very,
very important to me, okay?
I wanna make sure
in my life.
I'd die before I let
anything happen to her.
That's what I wanted to hear.
Because she's family, okay?
And now you're gonna be family.
And there's nothing more important
in the whole world than family.
That must have been one lousy movie.
That was me!
- Hi.
down the aisle just fine.
But if you choose me...
...you'll be getting some comedy.
Even so...
...l think I'm gonna pick Ross.
Yeah, I figured you might...
...because of the history,
and you used to love him...
...and you guys have a baby.
Well, thank you for respecting
my decision.
Let me tell you
I was always left out of everything...
...and it really made me feel insecure.
I was always picked last in gym...
...even behind that fat exchange student
who didn't know the rules to baseball.
I mean, this guy would strike out
and then run to third.
It's just so humiliating.
I mean, you know how it feels
- No.
Anyway, if I'm the only one
left out of this wedding...
...l just know that all those feelings
are gonna come rushing back.
All right, fine, I pick you.
Yes!
Make "groom" for Chandler.
Oh, my.
No, we're gonna do it my way.
I have another call, Reverend.
Hello?
- I'm glad we had this little talk.
- Yes.
And thanks for all the
wedding night advice.
That didn't make me
- Bye.
Did you guys know that there's
a giant ice sculpture in the hall?
Oh, my God, what's it doing here?
I guess it got sent to the billing address
as opposed to the shipping address.
- What a pickle.
stick your tongue on that?
- How's it going?
- Good.
I'm just getting some coffee
so I'm alert for the wedding.
That's what I was doing too.
Well, you have fun tonight.
- You too.
such an ass. Why are you?
- I'm not supposed to tell you.
- I'm not supposed to tell you.
Did Rachel say you could be
in the wedding?
- Yes.
I played the Emma card.
I looked into my soul.
You told us both
we could be in the wedding?
In my defense, you weren't
supposed to tell each other!
Rachel, only one of us can do it.
- I'll tell you at the wedding.
Hey, I forgot my scarf.
I can't do this. I don't know
which one of you guys to pick.
Oh, you haven't picked yet?
Oh, good, because I had an idea.
I thought it would be fun if the third
No. Rachel gets to choose.
Wow, this is a tough one.
I think I'm gonna have to go
with the dog.
So, what you're saying is
that the chef is at the Hamilton Club...
...but the food is not? And the drinks
- What?
I want you to be crazy bitch again.
Really?
Please?
- You really want me to come back?
- More than I wanna get married.
Okay, people, we are back in business!
Oh, God, I have missed you
so much. Okay.
Get your hair and makeup done.
- About what?
The blizzard.
I just saw on the news...
...it's the worst snowstorm
in  years.
They already closed
are coming in from New Jersey.
I don't think they are.
Looks like you're not gonna be
in the wedding, either.
So sorry, Pheebs.
- Well, the club lost its power.
- The news said most of the city did.
- Since when do you watch the news?
a very hot weather girl.
I can't believe you aren't
getting married today.
I know.
It's so beautiful out there. You always
wanted to get married outside.
- Why don't you just do it on the street?
for a more romantic setting.
This could be the simple wedding
you've always wanted.
What do you think?
I think I wanna get married to you today.
Me too. Monica, do you think
we could do it?
Affirmative!
Okay, let's get these chairs out here!
Gunther, hit the Christmas lights.
Okay, who left the ice sculpture
- Hey, you made it. Great. Chappy!
- There you go.
- Hi. Hi.
I know getting married in the street
isn't what you approve of.
No, it's lovely. The lights and the snow.
to handle all this snow.
Someone has to
walk him down the aisle.
- Would this person be in the wedding?
- I guess.
- I'll do it!
I mean, aren't you scared of dogs?
I'm not scared.
I'll just take little Chappy and--
He can sense my fear!
My throat is exposed!
I guess I'm in the wedding then.
He stinks.
Level one alert! I repeat,
He's snowed in, he can't make it.
- Oh, no.
- Hey, don't worry.
- I'm still ordained from your wedding.
- Really?
Yeah. You think I'd give up being
but, yeah, we do.
We have to find someone else
to walk Phoebe down the aisle.
I'll do it!
Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position.
Chandler, come with me.
Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony,
and Chandler's giving you away.
Oh, okay. Hi, new Dad.
So you ready to do this?
Oh, my God. This is really happening.
- Phoebe, I'm so happy for you, honey.
Wait, wait! No hugs! The dresses!
- Oh, what the hell.
- Oh, come on.
- I love you guys.
- I love you.
Okay, it's zero hour!
to wear that headset in bed?
I have you scheduled for nudity
at  hours.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, Marjorie, hit it.
- Jeez, Ross. You could've showered.
- It's the dog.
Groomsman? Why are you standing
Bridesmaid down!
Oh, that's me.
- Ready?
- Okay.
Oh, wait. Oh, no. Wait.
Wow. Aren't you gonna be cold?
I don't care.
I'll be my "something blue."
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.
My God.
Aren't you freezing?
Friends. Family.
Dog.
Thank you all for being here
to my special place...
...so I'm gonna do
the short version of this.
Phoebe and Mike
are perfect for each other.
And I know I speak for everyone here...
...when I wish them
their family's honor.
How could I not get that part?
Stupid Ralph Macchio.
Right. Okay.
Who has the rings?
Okay.
When I was growing up,
I didn't have a normal mom and dad...
...or a regular family like everybody else.
And I always knew
I'm ever gonna need.
You are my family.
Phoebe, you are so beautiful.
You're so kind. You're so generous.
You're so wonderfully weird.
Every day with you is an adventure.
And I can't believe how lucky I am.
And I can't wait
to share my life with you forever.
Oh, wait! Oh, I forgot. And...
...l love you.
And you have nice eyes.
I love you too.
- Joey?
- Yeah?
Chappy's heart rate
to be your husband?
I do.
Mike, do you take this woman
to be your wife?
I do.
I now pronounce you...
...husband and wife.
I got married!
Could someone get me a coat?
I'm frigging freezing.
- It really was an incredible wedding.
Hey...
...you wanna come in for a drink
and a bite of corsage?
I'd love to, but it's  hours...
...and I'm about to have the most
organized sex anyone's ever had.
- Whatever happened to Ross?
hot girl he talked to.
Come on, Chappy! Do your business!
Make!
Make!
I did not sign on for this.
Hi!
- Hey!
- Hi!
- How was the honeymoon?
- Oh, incredible!
Champagne, candle-lit dinners,
- He's at the doctor.
He didn't poop while we were there.
Shoot, I wasn't supposed
to tell you that.
I mean-- Okay, he's at a gig.
A gig we are definitely not going to.
- I'm glad you're back. I need your help.
- Oh, why, what's up?
I have an audition for this play,
I'm fluent in.
- Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.
- Yeah, you really shouldn't.
By the way, how was
that yearlong dig in Cairo?
It was okay.
I did not know you spoke French.
You're so sexy.
- Well, so will you help me?
I'm gonna jump on you.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Why are you wearing my apron?
I'm making cookies for Erica.
We have to leave soon.
Her plane comes in in about an hour.
When she gets here, is it okay
carrying my child?
No?
Divorce?
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You know where Rachel is?
- Haven't seen her since morning.
It's unbelievable. She was supposed
- Hey!
- These are for Erica!
- She's gonna eat all those cookies?
Well, I want the baby
to come out all cute and fat!
- So why is Erica coming to visit?
so she wants to see the tourist spots
Statue of Liberty,
Empire State Building.
There's always so many people,
and they're being corralled like cattle.
And, you know, there's always
then why do you do it?
- You should take her to a museum.
- Oh, please.
So I can hear Chandler say
over and over again
"You call this art? I could make that."
It was a tower of sponges.
Oh, hi. Hi. Thanks for
What was it, a hair appointment?
A mani-pedi?
Was there a sale at Barneys?
My father had a heart attack.
While I was at Barneys.
- Oh, my God, Rach.
- Honey?
- I'm so sorry.
but he's heavily sedated.
Okay, I'm gonna go
to Long lsland with you.
- I mean, you can't be alone right now.
- No, come on, I'm totally okay.
I don't need you to come.
- I can totally handle this on my own.
of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Oh, I really could.
All right, it seems pretty simple.
Your first line is,
"My name is Claude."
So just repeat after me.
- Well, let's try it again.
- Okay.
It's not...
...quite what I'm saying.
Really? Sounds exactly the same to me.
- It does, really?
- Okay.
- Really listen.
- Got it.
- Hey, you guys!
- Hi.
I want you to meet
And this is the baby!
- Joey, Erica, baby.
- Hi.
Everyone, Erica! Baby!
Monica. Calm. Self.
- Hey, sit down.
- Thank you.
It's really nice to meet you guys.
or should I say
New York City.
Why would you say that?
Okay. What are you
gonna be doing today?
Well, I wanna see everything! Times
Square, Coney lsland, Rockefeller Center.
You should walk to the top
- Great.
This baby better be really good.
Hi. Excuse me, I'm here to see my
father. My name is Rachel Green.
- And I'm Dr. Ross Geller.
- Ross, please, this is a hospital.
That actually means something here.
- So can we please go in?
wait out here...
...because my throat is feeling a little
scratchy. I don't wanna infect him.
- Ross, please. Don't be so scared of him.
- I am not scared of him. I'm really sick.
- He's under sedation, so he's out.
was just money down the drain, huh?
Ms. Green? Your father's doctor's on
the phone if you'd like to speak to him.
Oh, great. Are you gonna be okay?
- He's unconscious. We'll be just fine.
- Okay.
- Did the TV wake you?
you tugged on my catheter.
What are you doing here, Geller?
Well, I came with Rachel,
who should be back any second.
- So, what's new?
- Oh, I had a little heart attack.
Right. Is it painful?
What, the heart attack
that Rachel back in here.
So, what's new with you? Knocked up
any more of my daughters lately?
Nope. Just the one. Rach!
Daddy, hi. You're awake.
- How are you?
- I'm okay.
By the way, Ross has been
for a couple more nights.
I know.
But I'm gonna go home
and get a bunch of your stuff...
...so that you're really comfortable.
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
It's pretty ironic, huh?
You being a heart surgeon,
and you had a heart attack.
It'd be like if I was eaten
Okay, so repeat after me.
Great! Okay, faster.
- Okay, it's too hard. I can't teach you.
- What are you doing?
I have to go before I put
your head through a wall.
Don't go, I need you!
make us some dinner...
...but all I found in your dad's fridge
was bacon and heavy cream.
I think we solved the mystery
of the heart attack.
- Did you call your parents?
- I just can't believe...
...I'm in Rachel Green's room.
- You've been in my room before.
- Yeah, sure, right.
Like I'd ever be
in Rachel Green's room.
Okay, I gotta tell you, it's really weird
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you had a rough day.
- Yeah.
It's just so weird seeing him like that,
you know? I mean, he's a doctor.
You don't expect doctors to get sick.
But we do.
He's gonna be okay, Rach.
I don't want him to wake up alone.
- What?
They gave him a lot of medication.
He wouldn't even know
if you were there.
We'll go see him first thing
in the morning.
- Really? I shouldn't feel guilty?
amazing daughter, okay?
- Right now you need to get some rest.
- Okay, maybe you're right.
Good night.
Wait, wait, wait.
Would you stay here with me
for a little while?
- Sure.
- Oh, of course.
Rachel Green is very happy
you're in her room.
Me too. Come here.
I just don't wanna be alone tonight.
Okay, well, I can maybe grab
a sleeping bag or--
No, Rach!
I'm sorry, I just don't
until we do it, will we?
Look--
You are upset about your father,
and you're feeling vulnerable...
...and I just don't feel
it would be right.
I feel like I'd be, you know,
you the advantage. Enjoy!
Look, I'm sure it would be great...
...but I think one of us
has to be thinking clearly.
So I'm gonna go.
Okay.
I'll see you in the morning.
I haven't had sex in four months.
I should get a medal for that!
Thanks so much for taking me
about Chandler, though.
- I just did not see this coming.
- New York is awesome!
- What is with you?
- I've been to these places before...
...but I've never really seen them.
Yeah, you miss a lot
who sing like people.
I mean, come on!
- Thank you for showing me around.
- Oh, it was our pleasure.
We're so much enjoying
getting to know you.
Well, if there's anything else
questions about the father?
Oh, sure. Yeah.
Well, he was my high-school boyfriend,
captain of the football team, really cute.
- Got a scholarship and went to college.
- That's great.
Yeah, it's almost definitely him.
How's that, now?
Well, there's a chance
with two guys...
...but they sort of overlapped.
So, what does the other guy do?
- Does he go to college too?
- No, he's in prison.
Was he falsely accused of something?
No.
He killed his father with a shovel.
Other than that, he's a great guy.
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
- Are you awake?
- Of course I'm awake.
Assume from now on
I mean, it could be the football guy.
Honey, it's us.
Of course it's the shovel killer.
Well, all right,
let's say that it is him.
Would we not want the baby? No.
- Would we treat him any differently?
who the father is.
- How?
- I don't know.
- They have tests for these things, right?
- Yes, but maybe we're just overreacting.
Easy for you to say.
"Mom" on his shovel-wielding arm.
<i>We'll now count from one to five.</i>
- <i>Good job.</i>
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hey, Joey.
Listen, I feel really badly about
So let's try it again.
That's okay. I don't need your help.
I worked on it myself,
and I gotta say I am pretty good.
- Really, can I hear some of it?
- Sure, sure.
Okay.
See?
You, you're not--
You're not-- You're--
Again, you're not speaking French!
Oh, well, I think I am. Yeah, and I think
I was doing a good job!
Hey, Rach, can you grab me
a cup of coffee?
Sure.
You've been quiet all morning.
Is everything okay?
- You sure you're all right?
grab us some breakfast.
- FYl.
- There it is.
In the future...
...when a girl asks for some
ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it.
Wait, wait, you're mad at me
- Really?
If you had done the right thing...
...l wouldn't have woken up
feeling stupid and embarrassed.
I would've woken up feeling
comforted and satisfied.
- Well--
I was just being a good guy.
I treated you with
respect and understanding.
Oh, that is so hot.
Hey, I was looking out for you.
Oh, really? Well, you know what?
I am a big girl.
I don't need someone telling me
of times before. This is the worst ever!
Oh, really? Really?
Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
Okay, you know--?
Hey, hey, you know what?
To avoid this little thing
Never having sex again.
- What?
- That's right! Sex is off the table!
I am never having sex with you again!
Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
- Hey. How was lunch?
- We had a good time.
By the way, I wanted
if the baby was a boy...
...that you name him after my father...
...Jiminy Billy Bob.
- Oh, really?
- No!
You were right. That was fun.
I'm gonna go finish packing.
- So is she gonna take the test?
- No, she doesn't have to.
- I found out who the father is.
- No, it's not.
How do you know?
Erica didn't pay attention
in sex ed class...
...because the things she did
with that prison guy?
It'd be pretty hard to make
hardly ever do, or the thing we never do?
The thing we never do.
Shovely Joe.
- Whenever you're ready, Joey.
- Right.
- I'm sorry, what's going on?
- Dude, come on, French it up.
Joey, do you speak French?
That's not French.
Neither is that.
You know what?
I heard this man speaking...
...the regional dialect of my
French town of Estée Lauder.
You really think this man
is speaking French?
Good job, little buddy.
That was some really good French.
But I think we're gonna go
- It was great.
See?
- Emma's down for the night.
- Oh, good.
- So I guess I'm gonna take off.
- Okay.
Hey, listen, just before you go--
I just wanna say thank you
you know, about the whole sex thing....
Probably not a great idea
to go down that road again.
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
It's a shame, though.
When we did it, it was pretty good.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's true.
Hey, do you remember
- You know?
- It was Valentine's Day.
- It was your birthday.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
Well, I guess that's all
- Not even once.
- No matter how much we want it.
- Even if we want it...
- ...really bad.
- That's what we decided.
Right.
- It's kind of hard, though. You know?
you know, that's--
Just seems like...
...such a...
...waste.
I hate waste.
- Ross?
- Yes?
Just so you know...
...with us...
...it's never off the table.
Damn it, it's never off the table.
- Okay, can you really tap-dance?
- No.
It's off the résumé.
- Archery?
- Would fall off a lot.
You can drink a gallon of milk
in  seconds?
That I can do.
Come on, you can drink
a gallon of milk in  seconds?
All right, watch me.
- Okay, you time me, ready?
- I don't know why we don't hang out...
- ...with married couples more often.
- Because every time we do...
...you make jokes about swinging
and scare them away.
You mean that Portuguese couple?
- Oh, well, I already ate, but sure.
Guess what happened at work today.
A dinosaur died a million years ago?
Try  million years ago. And then try
My tenure review board met today,
and I hear it's looking really good.
Yeah, do you have any idea what this
means in academic circles?
I am gonna get laid.
- Hi, you guys.
No one wanted seconds, right?
No, I'm good.
Guys, you're never gonna believe it.
This headhunter called me.
I have a meeting tomorrow
with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
- I'm up for tenure.
changing your name to Geller Bing?
No. No, it felt nice to acknowledge this.
- Where'd you go to do it?
- The--
The Ministry of Names...
...Bureau.
You never did it.
I'm sorry. It's just the idea of--
Of being an official Bing.
Hey, I will have you know that--
Who am I kidding? Let's call the kid
Geller and let Bing die with me.
- Here you go.
to take your name?
Oh, it's up to you. It's your name.
You've gotta live with it.
- Let's see. Call me Mrs. Hannigan.
- Mrs. Hannigan?
Can't you see I'm
- Hey, Joe.
We got things to check out
at the new house. You want to come?
- No, thank you.
- You're not happy about us moving...
...but you're the only one
You'll see how close it is.
No, it's not close.
You said it was in escrow.
I couldn't even find that on the map.
No, Joey. Escrow is....
There's money, and....
It's not the bank exactly.
I don't know what it is.
Joey, please come.
It would mean so much to us.
You know what? You are my friends.
We'll pick you up at .
- So glad you're coming.
- All right.
- Good for you. That was really mature.
- What? The only reason I'm going...
...to their stupid house is to point out
I'm gonna make them stay here.
You're a strange kind of grownup.
Joey, you can't make someone do
something they don't want to do.
Believe me. There's something I've been
trying to get Mike to do in bed, and--
- Can we not talk about that now?
really love this house.
You are not gonna talk them
into staying here.
Hey, I can convince people
to do anything, you know?
I bet I could even get Mike
with Gucci.
The reservation's probably under Gucci.
It's spelled like "gucky,"
which can be confusing.
Mr. Campbell's not here yet.
Let me show you to his table.
Oh, my God. That's my boss.
Mr. Campbell's table.
But my boss cannot see me.
I'm interviewing for another job.
I know. With "gucky."
- Rachel?
- I'm on a date.
That's great.
Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know,
- Yes, hi.
- James Campbell.
- Hi.
- Excuse us.
- Please.
He's cute.
Thank you, JewHunks.com, huh?
So...
...your résumé is quite impressive.
My résumé?
I wouldn't-- I wouldn't call
I'm talking about the work résumé.
Whatever happened
to just singing for no reason?
Maybe people found it weird.
So....
- Why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
- What?
- I don't.
why are we having this lunch?
What?
That's Hugo Boss?
I believe what she's trying to tell you
is that I'm her boss.
Mr. Boss...
...it is a pleasure to meet you.
This place is so depressing.
If I had to work here, I'd kill myself.
But you obviously haven't.
- How can I help you?
because I'm hiding from the law.
You're fun.
- You need to fill out this form.
- Okay. Well, just so I know--
I don't know how it works.
My name is Buffay...
...and my husband's name is Hannigan.
So is it supposed to be
- Well, not anything.
Yeah. Anything.
Oh, this could take a while.
- Get out of my line.
- Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs.
Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Hannigan.
to anything.
So I thought, "All right, here's
an opportunity to be creative."
So meet Princess Consuela
Bananahammock.
That's what we were
- Princess Consuela.
You seriously changed
your name to that?
Okay, so from now on, we have
to call you Princess Consuela?
No, I'm gonna have my friends
- Not good.
I always feel that way after an interview.
I'll bet it went better than you think.
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci
and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
That is a bad interview.
What are you talking about?
where I was having my interview...
...and he heard everything.
Later, he calls me into his office
and tells me he'll have to let me go...
...because I'm not a team player.
And I said, "Wait a minute. Yes, I am."
And then I had to sit there
for  minutes...
...while he proved that that,
Why is this here?
- Ross.
- I guess it's here...
...because I got tenure!
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.
This is the single greatest day
- Six?
- You want me to join you?
- I thought Joey was here. Five is good.
Wow, I'm gonna have a loogey
in my coffee tomorrow.
- Okay, I'll tell him.
I don't wanna spoil it.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.
Okay. Everybody take one, okay?
Israeli champagne.
And it's vanilla.
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery.
Hey, Rach, so how did your thing go?
Good. But I won't hear
about that for a couple days.
Oh, you know what,
finally paying off.
And to knowing that your career
doesn't mean everything.
But also knowing it means a lot.
But more importantly, to full,
well-rounded lives.
That center around work.
- To Ross.
about this is? I can never be fired.
- Oh, God.
- No, seriously.
I have job security for life.
You know? I mean,
I never have to worry.
Oh, look at you.
- No, it's okay. You didn't know.
Little heads-up would've been nice.
Thank you for letting us
see the house again.
And thank you for explaining
to us what escrow means.
I've already forgotten
Just let me know when you're through.
- So glad you decided to come.
- Me too. Yeah, this place is great.
So happy for you guys. Although,
you know, I hope you like fungus.
- What?
and they didn't find anything.
Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes
and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Maybe it's because you hung
your head out the window like a dog...
...the whole ride here.
Maybe.
So this is the living room, huh?
- Are you kidding?
I think I just saw a bat in the corner.
When your head was hanging out the
window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
Maybe.
Look, I just think you guys can
do better than this house, you know?
Or any other house for that matter.
Oh, Joey.
We know you're having a hard
- Fine! If you love this house so much...
...you should live here. Okay? I hope you
get used to that weird humming sound.
- Joey, we know that's you.
- No...
...it's not.
- Welcome back.
- So, what's new?
Well, I am no longer Phoebe Buffay.
- That's great. You changed your name?
- Yes, I did.
Meet Princess Consuela
Bananahammock.
- You're kidding, right?
- Yep.
You can't do that.
Why?
Why? It's fun. It's different.
No one else has a name like it.
Then I'm gonna change my name.
Great. Okay, what are
you gonna change it to?
Crap Bag.
- Mike Crap Bag?
- Yeah, I'm serious.
It's fun, it's different,
and no one else has a name like that.
Well, then great.
If you love it, I love it.
I do love it. And I love your name.
- Oh, hi. I'm Joey.
My stupid friends are buying
this house. Who are you?
I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents
are selling this house.
I hate my parents.
I hate my friends.
Look, there's gotta be a way
tell them that the house is haunted.
What are you, ?
- Okay. Let's hear your great idea.
- I don't have any great ideas.
I am .
There's gotta be a way.
I mean, you know...
...if Monica and Chandler move here,
and Rach. You know what I mean?
I really don't.
What am I gonna do?
I feel like I'm losing my friends.
- My parents say I'll make new friends.
- Yeah, sure, easy for you.
You're young.
Whiners are wieners.
Look, you want your friends
to be happy, right?
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Yeah.
Well, if moving here is gonna make them
happy, don't you want them to do it?
Yeah. Maybe.
Then you've gotta let them go.
Oh, I hate to admit it, but you're--
You're probably right.
How'd you get to be so smart?
I read a lot.
Just when I thought we could be friends.
Oh, hey, Rach.
built for a quick getaway.
Rachel?
Mark? Oh, my God.
- How have you been?
- Fantastic. You remember Ross.
Sure. Sure.
What's with the chair?
You know, you can't always
get a seat on the subway, so....
Clever.
So how are you?
You're not catching me
doesn't say "big promotion."
No, but it's good. You know,
I'm gonna take some time off...
- ...and do charity work.
- Are you sure?
We may have something
- Okay.
- Nice to see you again.
- Yeah. Yeah. I got tenure.
Oh, my God.
See? I told you something
good would come along.
And he seemed really nice.
You were insanely jealous of him.
- That is Mark?
- Yes.
I hate that guy.
No, no, no. You cannot
go to dinner with him.
- What? You don't want me to get a job?
don't trust that guy, okay?
You know what--? Okay, let's talk
about it later. There comes security.
Oh, I love this street.
The trees and the big front yards
and the actual picket fences.
Man, those two dogs are going at it.
- Hey. Where you been?
feel better about the whole thing.
Joey? There was a little girl who lived
here, but she died, like,  years ago.
What?
I'm just messing with you.
That's not funny. You know
I'm afraid of little-girl ghosts.
Now that you're okay with the house,
and not have a Joey room, do you?
Oh, my God.
Hey, can I have an aquarium?
And a sex swing?
- No.
- Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
After you, Ms. Bananahammock.
Thank you, Mr. Bag.
- Oh, hi, Rita.
This is my husband, Crap Bag.
Crap Bag?
If you need an easy way to remember it,
just think of a bag of crap.
- Okay. Excuse me.
- Yeah.
Okay, fine, you made your point. Can
How about Buffay-Hannigan?
Really?
Yeah. I'm Phoebe
Buffay-Hannigan-Bananahammock.
Do you even know what
a banana hammock is?
It's a funny word.
It's a Speedo.
Oh, crap.
- What are you thinking about?
- Nope.
She's still at dinner?
- I guess. Why, who's she with?
- That guy, Mark...
...from Bloomingdale's.
She thinks he's just being nice to her.
But I know he really wants
and he said he might have a job for her.
But I know he just wants
to get into her pants.
So, what if he wants to sleep with her?
I mean, she's single, and he's cute.
Excuse me?
Oh, please.
Yesterday, on the subway,
I was staring at her baby.
We're about to be parents.
Oh, sorry.
- Hi, you guys.
- Hi. So...
- ...how was dinner?
- Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I wonder why? What
married. His wife just had twins.
Should we send something?
How did the job stuff go?
He offered me one.
- That's great.
- Congratulations.
I know, it's amazing.
It's amazing. It's so much better
than what I had at Ralph Lauren.
- The money is great.
something better would come along?
You didn't believe me. I told you
everything was gonna work out.
You know what? This calls
for a bottle of lsrael's finest.
The job is in Paris.
I mean, this soap opera is a great gig...
...but am I missing opportunities?
You know, I've always thought
more independent movies?
I don't know.
But you know what?
I'm gonna put you on with my bear.
Hold on.
Hey, Bailey, I need some career advice.
- How did the job stuff go?
- He offered me one!
You know what? This calls
somebody say something.
So if you take this job,
you'll be moving to Paris?
Or facing a bitch of a commute.
I know, it's huge, and it's scary
and it's really far away from you guys.
But this is such
our situation with Emma...
...and they said they'll do whatever
we need to make us feel comfortable.
I mean, I'll fly back and forth,
they'll fly you out. Anything we want.
My boss said I might be getting
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- You sure this is what you want?
- I think it is.
- What's going on?
- I got a really incredible job offer.
- Hey, great! All right!
- What?
No, no, no! No, no, no!
No, too much is changing, okay?
First Phoebe getting married.
Congratulations.
And then these two move in
- It comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it!
You guys, this is really, really
important to me.
It means a lot if you could try
to get onboard.
- Of course we can. Congratulations.
for people staying in America!
Joey, it would mean--
No! Get your France-going arms
away from me!
- Are you okay with this?
- Well, it makes me feel sad, but--
- Talking to Ross.
Not being able to see her every day?
How could I be okay with this?
But what are we gonna do?
She really needs this job.
Do you think if Ralph Lauren offered her
her old job back, she would take it?
How's that gonna happen?
Is this the best way to use
I could talk to her boss. Yeah.
I met him at that Christmas party.
I mean, we really hit it off.
- The guy who kept calling you "Ron"?
- I didn't say we were brothers!
Technically, this is not a hug.
You read the obituaries?
Yeah. Well, I got a few curses on people.
I just like to see how they're coming.
- Hey, Phoebe. Hey.
we're buying just went on the market.
I wanna take a look at it,
but Chandler doesn't.
We close escrow tomorrow.
Seeing another house can only
confuse us. We're easily confused.
We're not very bright.
But what if it's better than ours?
you should work at a Baskin-Robbins.
Anyway....
- Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
- Yeah.
- She died.
- You're kidding!
- That's terrible.
to fly solo across the Atlantic!
- Wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, she was just an agent.
- Joey's gonna be so upset.
I know. He always wanted to be the
about everything changing.
This'll push him over the edge.
- You don't think we should tell him?
- Not for a while.
Let's just give him a few days
to get used to everything else.
What if he reads the paper?
Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown,
- Yeah. I'm a friend of Rachel Green's.
Actually, we met at the Christmas party
about two years ago.
- Oh, right. Don?
- Close. Ron.
Well, what can I do for you?
Well, I'm here to see
and do this?
First I have to get you to agree...
...then we'll see
if she wants to come back.
Wow, that is tempting.
She loved her job here. Let's face it,
you're not gonna find anyone...
...who did it as well as she did.
- I took a shot there.
But I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do.
Oh, that's not true.
There's nothing I want to do.
I see.
Thanks very much.
- Is this your son?
- Nothing, it's just that it's close to Ron.
Does little Ross like dinosaurs,
by any chance?
Yeah, they're all he talks about. Why?
How would he like to come with me
to the Museum of Natural History...
...after everyone else has left,
have heard it, and that's not good.
Let me start again.
I'm a paleontologist.
You'll be there with us, and the
touching refers only to bones-- fossils!
- You could really arrange that?
the worst thing in the world.
Yes! Thank you! This is great!
Thank you so much.
I swear, your kid's gonna have
the time of his life.
That's great.
and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.
He'll be fine!
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.
- Everything okay?
- I'm just mad at my agent.
Estelle? Why?
There's a part in this TV movie
She better have a good reason.
I'm guessing she does.
Well, I wanna hear it,
because she keeps doing this.
No, wait, wait, wait!
All right, I gotta go.
Just listen. Promise me that you will
means never having to give a reason.
I love that saying!
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.
I was just gonna call you.
That's weird.
It's a little coincidental, but believable.
Listen, I'm sure you're wondering
all you do lately is drop the ball.
Don't take that tone with me.
Who do you think you are?
Alan Lemon, the first black man
to fly solo across the Atlantic?
No, look, all I'm saying is
any auditions and I'm tired of it.
What are you saying?
I'm saying that this isn't working
for me anymore, okay, Estelle?
You're fired. Goodbye.
Man, tough week for Estelle.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Emma left her stuffed T. Rex
- Well, she's asleep now.
- Stop forcing that thing on her.
- Okay.
You're not gonna believe
what happened to me today!
Ralph Lauren called
- I mean, it was the weirdest thing.
They fire me and then out of nowhere,
they just hire me back.
I mean, that place must just be
falling apart without me!
- So you're not going to Paris?
found out...
...that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,
they offered me more money!
Ross, isn't that great?
Hi. We're buying the house next door.
Could we just take a look around?
Sure, I'm showing it to someone else
on our house.
If we cheat, shouldn't it be
with a hot, younger house...
...that does stuff
that our house won't do?
Ours is so much better!
This living room is smaller,
- Love it!
We already have one offer. I think
the lady upstairs will make another one.
They could be our neighbors.
What are they like?
The woman upstairs is nice.
- Oh... my... God!
Sure.
Hey, Joey, you wanna
come with me to--?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I just feel bad
about firing Estelle.
This has gotta be killing her.
No, that wouldn't kill her.
A coronary embolism might.
I don't know. She's gotta be
than he makes.
Look, I know she's not a great agent,
but she did stick with me for  years.
- I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
- No, no, no! Don't call her.
- You wait for her to call you.
to understanding.
Which is the key to a happy heart.
You blow me away.
All right, so promise you're
gonna wait for her to call you?
- I promise.
- Okay.
And that means never having
made an honest man out of him...
...Chandler used to be
my little love muffin.
Don't judge me.
Why not? I do.
So are you guys thinking
of getting this house too?
Are we gonna have a bidding war?
the house next door.
Why?
I don't know why.
Oh, that decides it, then!
I was on the fence.
But knowing that you two
would be our neighbors?
Now we have to get it!
Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.
This cannot be happening.
The realtor said another couple
Maybe the other couple will.
The only way that'll happen is
if the other couple are the Hitlers!
Okay, okay! All right,
what if we get both houses?
- We can turn this one into a guesthouse!
I don't mean to sound distasteful...
...but when did you start
crapping money?
- You come up with an idea.
- All right.
We've still got three hours
- But we love our house.
Will we love it so much
with her next door?
And she's gonna be louder
out here too!
Just the crickets
she'll still show up wherever we go.
At least if she's here,
it eliminates the element of surprise.
Never again will you have to hear
the three words...
...that make your balls jump back up
We can't have her living next door.
Oh, that does it too.
Who is it?
It's me. Ron.
Look, I know Rachel turned you down...
...but I think there's a way you might
be able to get her to come back.
This may surprise you, but rehiring
fired employees is not my main job.
Just hear me out.
How would you feel
- Yes! Yes!
This is gonna make me very popular.
Believe me, the ladies, they love it.
I meant with my son.
Good, because the ladies,
not so much.
<i>Joey, this is Al Zebooker,</i>
<i>there's a memorial for her...</i>
<i>...at the Westside Chapel</i>
<itomorrow at  O.</i
<i>Hope you can make it.</i>
Oh, my God.
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.
Estelle?
Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that
I can't believe you're calling me.
I didn't think I should just drop by.
No, no! Don't drop by! Don't drop by!
Anyway, you did what you had to do.
I'm okay.
Can I ask you something?
What's it like there?
It's all right.
Look, kiddo, I gotta go.
Good luck with the career.
You're gonna be huge!
Thanks for everything, Estelle. Bye.
"Out of area." Boy, I'll say!
Well, I just talked to Sid.
We are definitely putting in
Tell Monica I say goodbye.
I'll see you later, neighbor.
Wait!
I just want you to know that
I'm so happy you're going to be here.
Oh, me too!
Because...
...that way...
...we can pick up where we left off.
I never stopped loving you.
- Oh... my--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I want you.
I need you.
I must have you,
we can be together every day.
Sid and Monica never have
to know a thing.
I don't know what to say.
I mean, you know, obviously
we have this heat between us.
Obviously.
But I love my husband.
And I know you love your wife.
I don't think we should get
the dream and take it away.
Chandler, one of us
has got to be strong.
I understand.
Although....
Maybe just one last moment
of weakness.
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.
They're never coming down now!
- Hi.
what happened to me today.
What?
Ralph Lauren called, again,
and they offered me more money.
- They did?
- Yes! It was the weirdest thing.
Zelner called me and said, "We will
what department that guy's in!
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Well, I took it!
That's great!
So you're staying in New York!
- You're excited, right?
- Right.
But, you know, I mean, was I looking
forward to going to Paris? Sure.
Was I excited about working
in the fashion capital of the world?
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah, but you know, this is....
It's fine. I'm fine going back
that I possibly can.
I had no idea--
I had no idea you were
so excited about Paris.
I mean, you said you were scared.
I mean, it was "good" scared, though,
you know?
I mean, like "when I moved
gonna have Emma" scared.
But this is fine.
This is gonna be good.
You should go.
What?
It's what you want. You should go.
You really think so?
I really do.
But I already told Zelner
that I would come back.
I'm sure he'll understand.
All right. All right! I'm gonna do it!
- Yeah.
I'm going to Paris!
- Thank you, Ross.
- Yeah, yeah.
Oh, I'm so happy.
Then I'm happy too.
Thank you all for coming.
We're here today to pay our respects
to a wonderful agent...
...and a beautiful woman.
Inside.
As Estelle's only two clients,
Al Zebooker, everybody!
All right,
let's play one more time, okay?
And remember, if I win,
you do not move to Paris.
Okay. I can't believe
Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.
Just flip.
- Tails!
- Damn it!
So we thought we'd throw you
a little going-away party around .
Oh, that sounds good.
Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow.
- Oh, yeah, right.
And after I took a shower this morning,
I just threw my towel on the floor.
- Oh, God, it hurts to even joke about it.
- I know.
Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage
the boxes that I'm having shipped...
...and that's the sandwich
I made for the plane.
Which could've used
a little more mustard.
- Okay, so you've done some good work.
is in here...
...and my travel documents
are on the counter...
...organized in the order that
I will be needing them.
Oh, my God.
- It should be next to my plane ticket.
- Well, it's not.
- What? Well, maybe I put it in here?
Oh, it's not in there!
Oh, no, I must have packed it
in one of these boxes!
- Here, let me help you.
that I took her passport?
Oh, wow, can you believe
you're only three weeks away?
I know.
- You don't mind me touching your belly?
- I don't mind you touching my belly...
...but your hand's kind of blocking the
- Hey.
Hi, Erica. Welcome back to town.
Wow, look how big you've gotten.
That's because I'm pregnant.
- Right. No, I understand.
- Oh, okay.
I'm just always afraid that people think
- She brought them up.
I didn't realize
you were coming back so soon.
In a couple weeks
I won't be able to travel.
And I wanted her to get to know the
- Because we're moving in a couple days.
Plus, hotels are fun! My room has
this little fridge full of free snacks.
Erica, those things aren't free.
They have one of the highest markups
of any consumer product--
Ross, she's giving us her baby.
are leaving this place.
I know. I know.
You know, you could take it if you want.
The lease is still in Nana's name.
No, no. This will always be your place.
It would be too sad.
Plus, how much a month
We talked about catching a movie.
Oh, no, he doesn't have time for that.
You can go help him and Joey
pack up the guest room.
Packing. Sexy cheerleader comedy.
Helpful brother.
Creepy loner at teen movie.
"Creepy...."
- What are you guys doing?
- We're taking a break.
From?
Jumping on the bed.
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple
of hours, and there's a lot to do.
Ross, you've got Geller blood.
You're in charge of these yahoos.
- You got it.
We gotta get serious.
Let's put Styrofoam peanuts
down his pants and kick him!
No, guys, she's right. We should get
to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet.
Joey, you pack them, and Ross,
- Hey, handcuffs. And fur-lined. Nice.
I didn't know you guys had it in you.
Chandler, you don't have a sister,
so you can't understand...
...how much this bums me out.
I didn't know Monica had these.
Maybe she used them
with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard.
Why would she use them with Richard
with scarves.
Bumming hard, guys.
Bumming hard.
- Hey.
- Hey. Where's Mike?
Oh, he has a gig.
It's kind of like being married
for a children's roller-skating party.
Rock on!
Wow, this is quite a spread.
What is all this stuff?
I thought this would be a great
opportunity to use up all the food...
...that I don't want to move
with a breakfast-cereal crust.
Kidney beans in their own juices,
and for dessert, a questionable orange.
Well, I think I speak
for everyone when I say:
- Hey.
- She's putting Emma down.
She'll be over in a second.
It just hit her that she's leaving.
She's kind of emotional, so no one
say anything to set her off, okay?
- Hey, Rach.
I'm gonna be fine.
- Come here, I'll make you a drink.
- Okay.
Oh, man, I can't believe
she's actually leaving.
How am I gonna say goodbye
such a big part of my life.
It feels like when <iMelrose Place</i
got cancelled.
I mean....
Forget it, I miss <iMelrose Place</i.
- I had a chance to stop her too.
- Yeah?
Who loses  coin tosses
- I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning.
So you doing okay?
Well, I've been better.
You guys are gonna come visit, right?
Yes! You know, in six months,
the statute of limitations runs out...
...and I can travel internationally again.
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
goodbye stuff that I wanted to say...
...to each of you. I was gonna save it
till the end of the night, but come here.
Hey, what do you think
they're doing in there?
If I had to guess, I'd say...
...Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap,
where to start.
Okay, well, before you do, I know we
weren't supposed to get you presents...
...but I do have something for you.
- What is it?
- Well, it's a cotton swab...
...with a bit of my saliva on it...
...so that if they perfect the cloning
to create your own Pheebs.
I'm gonna throw this away...
...but thank you so much for the gesture.
Chandler?
I was just in our bedroom,
and I found these on my pillow.
Oh, yes, I decided to leave those
out for you in case Richard stops by...
...and you want to engage in a little
from me.
That would be a terrible punishment.
But I'm serious,
I've never seen these before.
Really? Then what are they doing
in our guest room?
Rachel used to live in that room.
Rachel. With handcuffs.
Interesting.
Joey's bare ass.
Well played.
- I love you, Phoebe.
a French bitch.
I won't.
All right. Well, if I'm gonna do this,
I better keep going.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Monica?
- Sure.
- Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
- No.
Oh, you're so screwed.
Hey.
What was that all about?
She's gonna say goodbye
to each of us individually.
Are you kidding? Oh, my God.
Yeah, I know. It's gonna be
to do some serious crying.
Man, I'm not gonna be able
to handle this.
Now I know how my students feel
at the end of each year.
And why they act out
I'm gonna say.
None of the amazing things that have
happened to me in the last  years...
...would have happened
if it wasn't for you.
No one has been more like a sister to me.
I know what you mean.
You're like a sister to me too.
I don't know what I'm going to do
looks like we're deep in conversation.
Oh, so that thing you said
about the thing...
...it really made me think
about that other thing.
- Rach?
about that thing, huh?
Rach, I think I have something
that belongs to you.
I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh
at your weird jokes that I don't get.
No, no, they're really yours.
Maybe Monica used to use them with--
Don't say Richard.
Well, if they're not Monica's and
they're not yours, then whose are they?
I think you're forgetting the kinkiest
former resident of that room.
- Pheebs!
Look how flimsy they are. Come on.
My God, you try to hang a guy
from a water pipe with these...
...they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
- Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
- Sure.
You don't really handcuff guys
because once we get into this...
...I'm gonna get all uncomfortable
and probably make some stupid joke.
I just want to say that l--
I love you.
And I'm gonna miss you.
And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
Oh, you know what?
Let's not say anything else.
I love you.
Not so tight.
- I'm sorry, give me one more chance.
I can't. I can't.
- So I guess you're next. You ready?
- I don't think so.
Oh, you're definitely not.
I haven't cried like that in years.
You cried yesterday
by her mechanic.
God, I can't believe
she saved me for last.
Why are they taking so long?
I don't know. But, God, Joey seems
to be handling it surprisingly well.
- No!
- Yeah.
I think I'm gonna take off.
I have such a big, big day tomorrow, so--
- Rach.
- Yeah?
Aren't you forgetting something?
- Oh, right. Ross.
- Yes?
I forgot to write your mom a birthday card.
- Thank you.
Oh, you guys, this was an amazing
night. Thank you so much.
I love you.
Good night.
What?!
I don't get a goodbye?
Lucky bastard.
Unbelievable.
She says goodbye to everyone but me!
Well, maybe she thought that
- Well, it needs to be "plicit."
You know, maybe she was just
really spent from our talk.
- It was pretty intense.
- Yeah, mine too.
- Mine was a humdinger.
I mean, there's gotta be an explanation.
- Did you do anything to make her mad?
- No, I don't think so.
You didn't, say, borrow her
Really? Now?
I mean, don't I deserve anything?
you should go and talk to her.
And say what?
You owe me a goodbye?
- I mean, he's got more pride than that.
- The hell I do!
- I don't get a goodbye?
What do I gotta do to get a goodbye?
Be best friends with you?
Go out with you?
Have a baby with you?
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute!
I did all those things!
- Ross--
to say goodbye to five people.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,
goodbye, g--
It's physically impossible!
You know what?
After all we've been through...
...l can't believe this is how
may not be the best time...
...but Joey's going over the balcony again.
Could you just come talk to him?
- I hope Ross isn't too upset.
- I'm sure he's not more bummed out...
- ...than I am.
we don't know how to throw a party.
I think I'm gonna head out.
- Where do you think you're going?
- I thought I was going home to bed...
...but I'm sensing there's something
less fun for me to do here.
We're moving, and we got
- Joey and I can finish up the guest room.
Yeah, good idea.
Oh, no. You and Phoebe
are gonna help me in here.
You couldn't be cool.
We're gonna start in the kitchen.
Plates get put into plate protectors
and stacked  to a box.
The silverware gets bundled in rubber
- Good. I need you to be careful...
...and efficient. And remember,
if I'm harsh with you...
...it is only because
you're doing it wrong.
Hey, Mon, I think I figured out
- Well, I was cleaning out the closet...
...and I found some pictures of them...
- ...being used.
- Oh, my God, let me see.
Who's that dirty old lady?
Monica's grandmother.
Oh, my God.
Nana liked it rough!
- Hi.
- Oh, just normal pictures...
...of our regular family not having sex.
- Oh, here, have a seat.
- Yeah.
- How was your night?
- Oh, it was okay.
I went to a movie with my cousin
really amazing cheeseburgers.
- Erica, are you okay?
- Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.
I keep getting these stomachaches.
They come and go every few minutes.
- Oh, my God.
She's in labor!
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, you gotta get to the hospital!
Chandler, get the coats! Erica, let's go!
Phoebe and Joey, keep packing!
Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby.
We're gonna have a baby!
Oh, my God,
I've gotta sit down!
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.
- You can do this. Just breathe.
Okay. Okay.
Okay, I feel a little better.
Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure. Oh, honey, let's go.
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.
- Good luck!
- Chandler, wait, wait, wait!
- What?
If you get a second, find out
where she got that cheeseburger.
"Dear, Judy.
Happy birthday, love Rach--"
No. You know what? I'm not doing this.
You think I didn't say goodbye
you do not know one thing about me!
- Then why didn't you say something?
- Because it is too damn hard, Ross!
I can't even begin to explain to you
how much I am gonna miss you.
When I think about not seeing you
I didn't say goodbye to you...
...because you don't mean as much
to me as everybody else, you're wrong.
It's because you mean more to me.
So there, all right?
There's your goodbye!
- Rach!
- What?
- A little more.
- Okay.
- A little more. A little more.
- All right.
Little more.
- All right. All right, let's do this.
if every box isn't labeled.
You're right, yeah. Okay....
"Box of crap."
It's so wild. When Monica and Chandler
come back, they are gonna have a baby.
- A baby!
- I know.
Wait. Ross doesn't know
Rachel's still there yelling at him.
Poor guy. I would not
wanna be him right now.
Wait. Wait. Should we be doing this?
I don't know.
- It's probably not a really good idea.
- Yeah, probably not.
- Well, that never stopped us before.
be parents soon.
I can't believe it's three weeks early.
I love that our baby is prompt.
Okay. All right, what room
did the nurse say Erica was in?
- .
- Okay.
- Come on, baby.
that was coming out of that woman?
I couldn't tell who was
giving birth to who.
- Hi.
- Hey. How's it going?
It's okay. The doctor says
- Well, it hurts sometimes.
Not too bad yet, though.
It's a little scary.
Oh, I know.
But, honey, you're gonna be fine.
Tell that to the lady in 
<iSex for Dummies</i as a joke.
- Who's laughing now?
- I am.
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
Okay. Good.
Next time, can I say "breathe"?
No. Last time, you said it
like Dracula, and it scared her.
Do you want some more ice chips?
- No, I'm okay.
- To use the bathroom.
- You can't leave me alone with her.
- What?
This is exactly
the kind of social situation...
...that I am not comfortable with.
What kind of social situation
any time, you know, alone together.
You'll be fine. You won't,
but I'll be back in two minutes.
Okay.
So any plans for the summer?
I don't know. Maybe church camp.
May not want to mention this.
So you ever wonder which is worse?
You know, going through labor
or getting kicked in the nuts?
- What?
because no one can experience both.
One of life's great
unanswerable questions.
Who knows? Maybe there's something
even more painful than those things.
Like this.
- Come in.
- What's that?
Oh, it's my housewarming present
for Monica and Chandler.
That's a baby chick and duck.
And I named them Chick Jr.
And Duck Jr.
I did not see that coming.
They'll love it at that new house.
they'll go to that farm...
...that Chandler took
the other chick and duck to.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- It's a shame people can't visit there.
- What?
Erica went into labor. Monica and
Chandler are at the hospital right now.
- Oh, my God!
- I have a feeling it's gonna be a girl.
Phoebe, you were sure Ben
- I think she's still asleep.
How did it go with you guys last night?
She seemed pretty pissed at you.
We worked things out.
What's that smile?
Did something happen with you two?
Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell.
But I'm also not one to have sex
- So, what does that mean?
- Are you guys getting back together?
- Oh, I don't know.
- We didn't really get to talk.
- But do you want to get back together?
I don't know.
It was incredible.
I never wanted to let her go.
Know what? Yeah, I do.
I want to be together.
So is she still going to Paris?
Wow, I hadn't thought of that.
I hope not.
This is, like, the best day ever. Ever.
There are chicks and ducks...
...in the world again.
I feel like I'm in a musical.
- Morning.
- Guess you'll never know how it ends.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi. How'd you sleep?
- I'll bet you did.
Would you guys mind
giving us a minute?
Sure. Just keep an eye
on the chick and duck.
Chick and the duck?
Headfirst into fun on the farm.
So....
- Morning.
- You too.
- Last night was just wonderful.
- Oh, it really was.
I woke up today with the biggest smile.
I know, me too. It was....
You know, it was one of those things
and it's everything you want it to be.
I know. It was just....
It's just the perfect way
to say goodbye.
- Just a little bit more, honey.
- Oh, man, this hurts!
Is it really that bad?
I think it's time to kick you
top of a head I have ever seen.
- Chandler, you have to see this.
- I'm okay.
You don't want to miss this.
This is the birth of your child.
- It's the miracle of life.
- He's just fine.
You did it.
It's a baby.
A beautiful little baby. And some other
stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
- Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
- Okay.
Well, that's spongy.
Hey, handsome.
I'll love you so much that no woman
- I know.
He has your eyes.
I mean, I know that's not possible,
but he does.
We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
Oh, my God, he's beautiful.
- Thank you so much.
- I'm really happy for you guys.
- How do you feel?
The other one will be along in a minute.
I'm sorry, who should be along
in a what, now?
The next baby should be
along in a minute.
We only ordered one.
- You know it's twins, right?
of two people in the know.
I can't believe you didn't know it's twins.
This has never happened before.
Well, gosh. That makes me
feel so special and good.
Did you know it was twins?
It's here in the paperwork
- I don't think so.
They did mention two heartbeats, but l
thought it was just mine and the baby's.
They said,
"Both heartbeats are strong."
And I thought, "Well, that's good,
- Twins actually run in my family.
Interesting.
Can I see you for a second?
- What do we do?
- What do you mean, "What do we do?"
Twins!
Twins!
- Chandler, you're panicking.
- Join me, won't you?
What do you say we keep one and then
- Why not?
We could give each of them
half a medallion.
And then years later,
they'll find each other...
...and be reunited. I mean,
the other one is horrible?
What if they're not?
What if it's adopted by a king?
Yeah. Because I hear the king
is looking to adopt.
Monica, we are not ready
We have waited so long for this.
I don't care if it's two babies.
I don't care if it's three babies.
I don't care if the entire cast
We are taking them home
- Okay!
Okay.
It looks like we're about ready
over here. Come on, Erica.
Start pushing again now.
- Here she comes.
- She? It's a girl?
Yeah.
Well, now we have one of each.
And that's enough.
And then she said it was
- You've got to tell her how you feel.
- No way.
- Well, you can't just give up.
Is that what a dinosaur would do?
- What?
- I'm just trying to speak your language.
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you
She might not even go.
- You really think so?
- I'm telling you!
Oh, this is the part of the musical where
there'd be a good, convincing song.
- Hi.
- Hi. I dropped Emma off at my mom's.
- Okay.
- You're not taking her tonight?
We decided I'd set up, then my mom
would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
Eight-hour flight with a baby.
talking about Atkins. Good luck, Emma.
All right. You know what? You're right.
I should at least tell her how I feel.
- Ross. Wait, wait.
- What? What?
Could you get me a muffin?
- Rachel?
but I just have to tell you.
I love you.
Now, I don't know
if that changes your plans at all.
But I thought you should know.
Gunther.
I love you too.
Probably not in the same way.
But I do. And when I'm
brighter than the sun...
...I'll think of you.
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.
Oh, my God!
Unbelievable.
- Hey, you know what might help?
- I'm not getting you a muffin!
Do you think they recognize
who've lived in apartments...
...next to each other for years, then one
day they're pushed through a vagina...
...and they meet.
We're going to take Erica
to Recovery now.
There's something
You're gonna make great parents.
Even Chandler.
- Okay, well, bye.
- Bye.
- We'll call you.
- Okay.
Have fun at church camp.
- Look at these little bunnies.
- Okay.
Okay. Let's see.
- We could trade later.
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Hey, what are you working on?
- A "welcome home" sign for the baby.
How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
No, I sat in the paint.
- Hey.
- What?
- Why not?
- She's just gonna shoot me down.
You saw what happened with Gunther.
That did not look like fun.
How can you compare
in a more obvious way.
You have a relationship with her.
You slept together last night.
Yeah, and she still wants to go.
It's pretty clear where she is.
I know what you mean.
- Damn it!
If I were gonna tell her,
I don't have to do it now.
Okay? I'll be seeing her again.
We've got time.
No, you don't. She's going to Paris!
are in Paris? It's a city of Gunthers.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- What do you have there?
- Oh, I made a little something.
If I had more time to work on it,
- Honey, that's gorgeous.
You know, the baby can't read, Mike.
Hi. The car service just got here.
I can't believe they're not home yet!
I have to catch my stupid plane.
I want to see the baby.
Monica just called from the cab.
- Yeah, did she sound happy about it?
Because my friend Ethel's baby
was born with a teeny-tiny beard.
- Welcome home.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh.
- How did this--?
Okay, awkward question.
The hospital knows you took two, right?
- Yes. It's twins.
- Oh, my-- They are so cute.
- Now, what kinds are they?
was Erica.
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't
get to spend more time together.
Yeah, and we named the boy Jack,
after Dad.
- He's gonna be so happy.
You know, "Jack Bing, <i>Morning Gazette.</i>
I'm gonna blow this story wide open."
Oh, my gosh.
- So beautiful.
- I want one.
Oh, yeah? Well, tell me which one.
I'll try to slip it in my coat.
Seriously. I mean,
- Really?
Yeah. We can teach them to sing, and
we could be like the von Trapp family.
Only without the Nazis.
Although that sounds kind of dull.
I can't believe this. If I don't leave now,
- Me too.
I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to
watch you two attempt to handle this.
All right. Oh, I can't say goodbye
to you guys again.
- I love you all so much.
- Call us when you get there.
I will. Ross, come here.
I just want you to know...
...last night...
...I'll never forget it.
Neither will l.
All right. Now I really have to go.
Okay, <i>au revoir</i>.
They're gonna really hate me
over there.
So you just let her go?
Yeah.
- Hey, maybe that's for the best.
- Yeah?
Yeah. You know, you just--
the way she does.
Okay? You know, maybe....
Maybe sleeping together was
the perfect way to say goodbye.
They slept together?
I was with you.
- Now she'll never know how he feels.
- Maybe that's okay, you know?
Maybe it is better this way.
I mean, now.... Now you can move on.
I mean, you've been trying to
on different continents....
Right?
Maybe now you can actually do it,
you know.
You can finally get over her.
Yeah, that's true.
Except....
- I don't want to get over her.
- What?
- I don't. I want to be with her.
- Yeah, you are!
Wait! Wait!
Get your coat! Get your coat!
- My coat.
- This is so cool!
I have no idea what's going on,
- I don't know.
Even if she shoots me down, at least
I won't spend my life wondering...
...what would have happened.
Where is my coat?
You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs.
- Hurry!
Good luck!
Oh, my God.
Ross is going after Rachel.
And you guys have babies.
This is, like, the best day ever!
Why is there an ass-shaped paint stain
on my couch?
She asked you a question, Mike.
You really think we'll make it in time?
Hey, I didn't have my license taken away
- That's okay. If we hit anything...
...the engine will explode, so it's better
if you're thrown from the car.
- All right, all right. Let's do this.
- Okay!
- Hey!
- The law makes you accept any fare.
You don't understand.
This cab isn't real.
What's your medallion number?
My medallion number is,
get out of the cab!
- What?
- Okay.
Oh, hey, can I give you guys
my housewarming gift now?
- Now, that you can do.
- All right.
I have a question.
Without looking under their diapers,
in high school with that vagina.
Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.?
Don't hide from Mama!
You can open your eyes now.
- Are we off the bridge?
- Yes!
- Is the woman on the bicycle still alive?
- Yeah, she jumped right back up.
- Oh, my God. Phoebe, slow down!
to die in your cab.
You should have thought of that
before you got in!
- Tollbooth.
- What?
Tollbooth!
Four bucks. There are quarters
what was taking so long...
...but now we understand.
You were doing this.
Okay. I wanted to surprise you, but....
For your housewarming gift,
I got you a baby chick and a baby duck.
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Oh, great. Just what you want for
Now they're gone!
Don't worry, we'll find them.
Actually, I'm gonna go check
on the twins.
Oh, God! What did I just step on?
It's okay. It's just an egg roll.
You stepped on my egg roll?!
I'm sorry. I didn't know to look
for Chinese food on the floor.
Just put it on a plate and leave.
- Okay. Let's find these birds.
- Well, that can't be good.
- We gotta get them out of there!
- How?
Maybe we can lure them out.
You know any birdcalls?
Oh, tons. I'm quite the woodsman.
Well, maybe we can just
we have to bust it open?
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Oh, my God.
I know. It's-- It's the foosball table.
All right, you know what?
We don't have a choice.
It's like I would have said in that
and we have to get them out...
...even if I have to sacrifice
the most important thing in my life...
...my time machine.
- Did that movie ever get made?
- It did not.
- To talk to Rachel.
Isn't that why we took a ride
in the death cab?
You're walking up to her at the gate?
Have you never chased anyone
through the airport before?
Not since my cop show got canceled.
You have to get a ticket
- Not with that attitude. Now, haul ass!
Okay, if you could all walk slower,
that'd be great.
- Madame, your passport, please.
- Oh, my God.
I was afraid I wouldn't remember
you just said.
- Your boarding pass, please.
- Oh, sure.
Shoot, I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
- Madame, if you don't have your--
- I have it, I have it!
Okay, I can't find it, but I remember
we would not be having this problem.
- Hi. I need a ticket.
- Just one?
I drive you here, and I don't get
to see how it works out?
- Fine. Two tickets. I need two tickets.
- I don't care. Whatever's the cheapest.
I'm so lucky I married you.
Oh, shoot. Damn it. Where is it?
I found it. I found it.
I told you I would find it.
In your face. You're a different person.
Sorry.
Okay. Flight , Paris.
- I don't see it. Do you see it?
- No. Did we miss it?
No, no, it's impossible.
the flight number wrong.
God.
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
What?
Hey. Hey, listen--
You wouldn't believe the cute noises
the twins are making. Wait, listen.
But Monica--
Monica. Monica. Monica.
I'm sorry. They were doing it before.
- That's all right. Listen, listen.
- Isn't that cute?
That is precious! Listen....
- I need Rachel's flight information.
- <iOh, okay.</i
- I have that. It's not on the board.
That's what it says here. Flight .
- <iNewark Airport.</i
- Why? Where are you?
- JFK.
Don't worry, you guys!
We're gonna get you out of there!
And we're also gonna buy you
to the table first.
I understand.
Okay.
Table...
...you have given us
so many great times.
And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel....
All of you guys. What can I say?
You guys make us look good.
- You want to say anything?
- I don't know.
Except that, for one last time....
Good game. Good game. Good game.
Good game.
Okay. Here we go.
I can't do it.
Well, I can't do it either.
- Hey. Did you find them?
but neither of us can do it.
Oh, well, sure. It's got to be so hard.
I'll do it. Give me.
Phoebe!
No, no, no!
Wow, I've never gone this fast before.
Phoebe, forget it, okay?
Newark is, like, an hour away.
There's no way we'll make it in time.
- She's got her cell. You could call her.
- I am not doing this over the phone.
You don't have any other choice.
- Hello?
did you just get on the plane?
- Yeah.
- We would have caught her...
...if we were at the right airport.
- Rachel, hang on.
Phoebe, is everything okay?
Actually, no. No.
- I have this feeling that...
...something's wrong with it. Something
is wrong with the left phalange.
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's
nothing wrong with the plane.
Look, I have to go. I love you, and l
- Oh, that was just my crazy friend.
She told me to get off the plane
because she had a "feeling" that there...
...was something wrong
with the left phalange.
- Okay. That doesn't sound good.
and she's almost never right.
- But she is sometimes.
- Well....
- What are you doing?
- I can't take this plane now.
- Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?
wrong with the left phalange.
Could I get some peanuts?
- What's wrong with the plane?
- There's nothing wrong.
- The left phalange.
- There's no "phalange."
Oh, my God. This plane
- Please sit down.
- What's going on?
- We're getting off. There is no phalange!
This is ridiculous. I--
Yeah, okay.
All right. My job here is done.
That was impressive.
Yeah. You didn't even use the tools
for most of it.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down.
All right. I gotta get back to the babies.
- Yeah.
You gonna buy a new one?
Probably not. No.
I don't know how much I'm gonna
want to play after you go.
- At least we got these little guys out.
- Yeah.
We were worried about you.
I guess I better get used to things
should keep them here with you.
- What?
- Yeah. We got a lot going on right now.
And plus, here,
they'd have their own room.
I could get a goose!
You know, I think you're set
And it's good...
...you know, because....
Because now you have
a reason to come visit.
I think there may be another reason.
So....
Awkward hug
or lame cool-guy handshake?
Yeah, well, you know,
- And you fixed the phalange?
Yes. The phalange's fixed.
In fact, we've put a whole lot of extra
phalanges onboard, just in case.
<i>Paging Mr. Anderson.</i>
- Where is she?
- There she is!
Rachel! Rachel!
- Whoa, do you have a boarding pass?
- No. I just have to talk to someone.
I'm sorry. You need a boarding pass.
- No, no. But you don't--
- Rachel!
What? Oh, my God.
scaring me. What's going on?
- Okay. Thing is....
- Yeah.
- Don't go.
- What?
Please, please stay with me. I am
- I know. I know.
I shouldn't have waited till now to say it,
but-- That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry.
But I'm telling you now. I love you.
- Do not get on this plane.
- Miss, are you boarding the plane?
Hey, hey.
I know you love me. I know you do.
- Miss.
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.
- I do. They're waiting for me, Ross.
I can't do this right now, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Rachel.
I'm so sorry.
I really thought she'd stay.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Well, that's it.
Everything's packed.
- This is weird.
- Hey. Did you guys make it in time?
Yeah, yeah. He talked to her,
but she got on the plane anyway.
Where's Ross?
He went home.
He didn't want to see anybody.
<ithings to end with us.</i
<i>It's just that I wasn't expecting</i>
<i>to see you.</i>
<iAnd all of a sudden you're there</i
<i>and I didn't.</i>
<iI mean, I didn't even get to tell you</i
<i>that I love you too.</i>
<i>Because of course I do. I love you.</i>
<iI love you.</i
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>What am I doing? I love you.</i>
<iI've got to see you.</i
Oh, my God.
<ibut I need to get off the plane.</i
- <i>I need to tell someone that I love them.</i>
- <i>I can't let you off.</i>
Let her off the plane!
<i>You have to take your seat.</i>
<i>Oh, please, miss.</i>
Try to understand!
Did she get off the plane?
I got off the plane.
You got off the plane.
I do love you.
I love you too, and I am never
letting you go again.
Okay. Because this is where I want
to be. No more messing around.
- I don't want to mess this up again.
This is it.
This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Don't make jokes now.
Okay, please be careful with that.
It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
Thank you.
If that falls off the truck,
it wouldn't be the worst thing.
I know.
Seems smaller somehow.
Has it always been purple?
Look around, you guys.
filled with love and laughter.
But more important, because
of rent control, it was a frigging steal.
Hey, do you realize that, at one time or
another, we all lived in this apartment?
Oh, yeah. That's true.
I haven't.
What about that summer during college
 years without that coming up?
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised
Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
Oh, okay.
- So I guess this is it.
- Yeah.
I guess so.
This is harder than I thought
house now, or do you have some time?
We got some time.
- Okay. Should we get some coffee?
- Sure.
Where?
