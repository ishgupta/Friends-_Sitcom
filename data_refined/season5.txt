Friends, family,
in sickness and in health...
...till death parts us."
As my lawfully wedded wife,
in sickness and in health...
...until death parts us.
Really, I do. Emily.
Do you have the rings?
Place this ring on Ross' finger...
...as a symbol of
your bond everlasting.
Ross, place this ring...
...on Emily's hand as a symbol...
...of the love that
their declarations...
...and it gives me great pleasure
to declare them husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
This is worse than when
he married the lesbian.
Just keep smiling.
Well, that went well.
It could've been worse.
It's a nightmare!
My friends and family are out there!
How can I face them?
No matter what happens with them...
...we still get cake, right?
That's all right. You take your time.
I'll be right out here.
She's just fixing her makeup.
I hate you!
And I love you!
A bad time
personal physician, Dr. Filangie.
Who?
I discovered that Ross forgot
to take his brain medicine.
Without it, in the brain of Ross...
...women's names are interchangeable.
Through no fault of his own.
Oh, my God! Phoebe.
No, not Phoebe. Dr. Filangie.
Oh, no! You have it too!
What kind of bitch hangs up
on a doctor?
I hope you don't take this
to meet up tonight.
I'm worried about what it
might do to our friendship.
I know.
-How could we have let this happen?
-Seven times!
You know, look.
we can keep doing it, right?
Well, I don't see that
we have a choice.
But when we're back home,
we don't do it.
Only here.
You know, I saw
I can't just pretend it didn't happen.
I don't know.
Monica, what should I do?
Just do the right thing.
What?
Tow the line! Thread the needle!
Think outside the box!
I'll talk to Ross
about what he thinks it meant.
Wait! Rachel, no.
He's married.
Married.
If you don't realize that,
You can't help me.
Jack, is it all our fault?
Were we bad parents?
Who serves steak
when there's no place to sit?
How are you supposed to eat this?
Hey, what's up?
You and me, next dance?
Sorry, dear,
-Why?
The next tour of the wine cellar...
...will commence in two minutes.
Joey, what are you doing?
You promised, no meat
till Phoebe has the babies.
We're in another country,
so it doesn't count.
-True.
It'll be okay, right?
Oh, yeah! Of course.
She'll get over this.
So you said my name.
You just said it
because you saw me there.
If you'd seen a circus freak,
It's a mistake.
It didn't mean anything.
Right?
Oh, no! Of course
it didn't mean anything.
I can understand why Emily
It didn't! It didn't!
The band's ready
for your first dance with Emily.
Oh! The band's ready!
We've got to do what the band says.
I don't care about the stupid band!
You spit on me, man!
I'm sorry.
Emily is taking kind of a long time.
When I locked myself up
the window out of the frame.
Get the hell out of there.
You know?
I'm coming in!
Oh, look at that.
Same thing.
In the middle of everything,
-Oh, hello, Rachel.
Ross said my name.
Okay? My name!
Ross said my name up there.
That obviously means
he still loves me!
Don't believe me.
I know I'm right.
Do you guys want to go
-We'll only be five minutes.
Fifteen minutes.
Oh, Phoebe! It's Phoebe!
-Oh, hey, hey.
-Oh, great.
So, what happened?
Well, Ross said my name.
But I don't think
that means anything.
Let's look at this objectively.
Ninth grade, right?
The obsession starts.
Then he sees me in
I got a girl out here!
I got a girl in here!
No, you don't.
I saw you go in with Monica.
Well, we're hanging out.
Which one of us will be
having sex in there? Me or you?
I suppose I would
-Which we are!
And we've paid for it.
It's My Giant.
My Giant?
I love that movie!
Think this is okay?
Well, Ross and Emily
aren't going to use it.
Oh, it's so beautiful!
I don't feel right about this.
This is the honeymoon suite.
The room expects sex.
The room would be disappointed
if it didn't get sex.
All the other honeymoon suites
-I've looked everywhere.
You couldn't have,
or you would've found her.
-Keep looking!
-Yeah! For about  minutes?
Or ?
In  minutes,
but couldn't, because I kept moving.
From now on,
I'm staying in one place.
Right here.
-It's getting late.
-We're going to go.
Do you guys mind staying here
and catch that plane.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
That's cool.
But we'll stay here with you.
Thanks, guys!
I really appreciate this,
but you don't need to rub my butt.
We have to leave in an hour.
I know. I've been looking
at those doors.
They look pretty soundproof,
That's insane.
I mean, A, he could wake up.
And B, you know...
...Iet's go for it.
Nope.
-She's not with us.
-We've come for her things.
Where is she?
She's in hiding. She's humiliated.
between you and Emily, monkey.
But I think you're
absolutely delicious!
Excuse me,
I'm standing right here.
Oh, yes.
There you are.
Hurry up! Get some!
to leave tonight for our honeymoon.
Tell her I'll be at that airport,
and I hope she will too.
I said Rachel's name,
but it didn't mean anything.
She's just a friend.
Tell Emily I love her and...
...I can't imagine spending my life
you'll tell her that.
All right, I'll tell her.
Come on, bugger face!
Call me.
You spend your life in the bathroom.
Why do you never go out the window?
Maybe it's best we never
got to do it again.
Yeah, it kind of makes
over international waters.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Maybe I'll see you there?
Can I ask you something?
Felicity and I watched
My Giant. And I thought:
"I'll never be as good an actor
with this acting thing?
The giant's five years
younger than me.
You think I'll ever get there?
-Thanks, man.
-Okay, man.
But what about how much
I can make myself taller now.
Who knows what science will
come up with in the future...
...but what if I die an unsuccessful,
regular-size man?
You've been in the
I was talking about Monica.
I did not have sex.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off
and making me fat.
-I'll say hi to the chick and duck.
-Me too!
Why would you need to?
Maybe I'll just go home.
We certainly are alone.
Good thing we have that
"not New York" rule.
Listen, since we're on that subject...
...I just wanted to tell you that....
I was going through
a hard time in London...
...with my brother getting married and
And I'm trying to say thanks.
You know, that night
meant a lot to me too.
It wasn't because I was
in a bad place or anything.
It just meant a lot because
Does that count?
-Oh, that counts!
-Oh, good!
What are you doing here?
I've been on standby for
a flight home for hours.
So no sign of Emily?
Not yet.
When do you have to leave?
This is the last call
thinking she'd actually show up?
You're not an idiot, Ross.
You're a guy very much in love.
Same difference.
All passengers for flight 
to Athens should now be onboard.
I get it!
Well, that's that.
No, you know what?
I think you should go.
I think you should go...
...by yourself.
It would be really good.
I don't know.
Come on.
It would be really good for you.
I could do that.
I can't even believe her.
You know what?
I am going to go.
-Good.
-Right.
Thanks.
I'll see you back at home.
If I ever get a flight out of here.
What? Wait, what?
Why don't you come?
I mean, I have two tickets.
Why not?
Well, I don't know, Ross.
Really?
Yeah. It'd be great.
my failed marriage.
You see how I make jokes?
Really. I mean....
I could use a friend.
Oh, wow. Maybe.
Yes, I can do that!
-Cool.
-All right, cool.
Okay, we're going to Greece.
I forgot my jacket!
Well, you tell them to wait.
Wait! Wait!
I'll have a glass of Merlot...
...and he'll have
a wine spritzer.
Look!
Why are we moving?
Does the captain know
that we're moving?
Oh, my gosh!
You look cute in bubbles.
You're just all liquored up.
Hey, it's me. I'm coming in.
I've had a very long, hard day.
-You're home early.
-Yeah, my date threw up.
Want some chicken?
No, thanks. No chicken.
Some extra-crispy, dirty rice?
For the last time, no!
Get out, Joey!
All right.
Are you okay?
He wouldn't leave.
He kept asking me if I wanted chicken.
Chicken?
I could eat some chicken.
Could I get a three-piece,
-I have to tell you this story.
I was coming over
and this cabdriver
Was his name Angus?
What?
He was a cabdriver
we had in London.
All right. Anyway
What was that pub he took us to?
The Wheat Sheaf!
And they had that beer....
Boddington's!
Phoebe was going to tell a story.
So he had a really funny hat.
I don't want to talk about it.
-Hey.
frosty one of those bad boys.
They have them at the
British pub by the Trade Center.
Later!
Shouldn't Rachel be back?
Her plane got delayed.
But she should be here by now.
So you talked to her?
Did she sound mad?
No. But she likes me.
You abandoned her
I did what I had to do.
She's my wife.
Rachel is my wife.
Emily!
Emily is my wife.
Man, what is that?
You haven't heard from Emily?
Not since I lost her at the airport.
I can't believe she can outrun you.
Hey! She's fast, okay?
You think you can beat me?
Let's go! Outside!
-I'm sorry. I'm just a little
-Oh, my God, Rachel!
Rach, I am so sorry.
I am so, so sorry.
Come on.
You just did what you had to do.
That's it? You're not mad?
met the nice people.
It's not too shabby for Rachel.
So, what, that's it?
We're cool. Totally cool.
Thanks, Rach.
You're the best.
Oh, no. You're the best.
Oh, I got to go to the flower store.
No one will tell me where Emily is...
...so I'm sending  long-stemmed, red
roses to her parents' house.
One for each day
be sure to make it out to "Emily."
It's good that you had
such a good time in Greece.
What?
I didn't have a good time in Greece!
Ross abandoned me!
I couldn't get a plane out.
I had to stay in their suite!
People came up to me going,
You know why?
Because I make very bad decisions.
Oh, that's not true.
Yes, it is true.
I went after Ross in stupid London!
London is stupid! Stupid!
I put on a cheerleading outfit
to seduce Joshua.
Then I lost him because I asked him
on somebody else's honeymoon. Okay?
Do those sound like very good
decisions to you?
I like your little braid.
I just shouldn't be allowed
to make decisions anymore.
Phoebe, you were right.
all my decisions for me.
Oh, no.
I did that for someone once.
I'm not comfortable having
that power over someone's life.
I'll do it.
Fine. Monica, you are now
I still can't believe it.
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
I'll just have to accept it.
I mean, it's my fault.
Edges! Fingers! Smudgy!
Oh, my God!
That's okay. I know that
you're very upset right now.
I know that wasn't about me.
I bet it was about her a little.
If you'd stop thinking about Ross...
...you'd notice there are
great guys everywhere.
Look. Gunther.
He's nice. He's cute.
Yeah. I guess Gunther is....
What about that guy over there?
That's the guy you flirted with
-You're going to talk to him.
I make your decisions,
and I say you're going to talk to him.
All right.
You're the boss.
I got to do what you tell me.
Say that to him, and you're golden.
Hey, Phoebe.
at the Tower of London....
Here we all are.
There's Ross and Joey and you and
And me.
We've been talking about
London too much.
Sorry, it's just because
I couldn't be there.
All I get to do now is pregnant stuff.
-Sorry.
Know what I like to do?
It sounds a little corny...
...but sometimes when I'm bummed out,
I like to just close my eyes...
...and think about
-A little of this, a little of that.
I got myself a date tomorrow.
See? Didn't I tell you?
You're getting over Ross already.
Get out.
What took so long?
I got caught up at work.
But I'm quitting tomorrow.
So thanks for having me over.
See you, man.
What the hell was that?
Probably some European
to say goodbye too, mon frere.
Come here and give me a little sugar.
I really had a good time.
Yeah, me too.
I guess this is it.
Unless you want to come inside?
Wait a minute. You know what?
I can't decide this.
Okay. Just hold on a second.
Where's Monica?
I have to ask her something.
Doing her laundry.
What's that?
It came in the mail today.
It's  long-stemmed red roses.
One for each day
wander out in the rain for a while.
It's not raining.
I can't catch a break!
You're not going anywhere.
Sit right here.
I'll make you some tea
and we'll talk this out.
All right?
Hey, Dave.
I need to take a rain check.
bad...
...and that they won't get any
Could I talk to you?
I dropped some socks.
What is the matter with you?
Do you want to fall into the trap?
You did not drop any socks!
I saw Dave, and he said
you blew him off!
You listen to me!
I'm calling the shots!
you know, I wanted...
...to tell him that
I'm still in love with him.
What? You cannot tell him that!
Why? Why not?
People love to hear that!
Come on, I love you.
-Wasn't that nice?
-No.
I make the decisions and I say no!
You know what? No, you don't
and I say I'm not fired! Ha!
Well....
Come on, let me in!
Having some trouble?
Rachel locked the door.
I'll kick that door in
if you give me some sugar.
Ross, there's something
I wanna talk to you about.
-I just need to
-She's fine. Listen....
Rachel, I can do this all night if I have to!
-You want me to get that?
-No. Just let her do her thing...
...and we'll do our thing.
Because I really need to tell you
Thank you.
Rachel? Can I talk to you
that you wanted to do?
What thing?
Rachel wants to take
swing dance lessons.
Which I think is a really stupid idea.
It's dangerous.
She won't get what she wants.
And who knows who she might
Swing dancing can be tricky.
I have to use the phone.
I gotta cancel those five giant
teddy bears I sent to Emily.
My God! Think of the massacre.
I'm going to do it.
I know you think I'm crazy.
But before you tell him,
try to find one person...
...who thinks it's a good idea.
-Hey, Rach.
-Did you find anyone who agrees with you?
-No.
But you know what?
I think I need a male point of view.
Joey.
-You're a man.
if I told Ross that I was still in love with him?
Nope.
-Phoebe!
-Hey, Phoebe.
-Phoebe?
-Yeah.
You know how you were saying
about that...
...so we decided to
take a little trip together!
Oh, that's so nice!
How great!
Where's the trip?
Well, we thought we would all
I just came from there.
What'll we high-five about
at the stupid park?
It's right by my house.
All right!
I'm going home to bask in the
you've got going on.
And I need to say
it makes me very uncomfortable...
...and I just, you know, just stop it!
Just bringing some culture
to the group.
That's fine.
Phoebe is here!
-Phoebe! Woo!
-Okay. Woo! Hi!
Phoebe, we decided that
the picnic idea was a little....
It didn't have any....
all go away for the whole weekend...
...to Atlantic City.
Atlantic City! Oh, that's
a great plan! Whose plan was that?
Mine!
-Wait. It was my plan.
-No...
...I said we needed a new plan.
And I came up with Atlantic City.
Which is the new plan.
Why don't we all
I'm going to go pack my ass off.
Well, I think I'm gonna grab some coffee
because my ass is already packed.
Let's go.
You know what?
I'll meet you in a minute.
Rachel, you didn't find anyone,
That doesn't matter.
Do you know how painful it is
to tell someone you love them...
...and not have them say it back?
I don't care.
I can't watch.
What you reading?
Paper.
Yeah? What's it about?
Events from around the globe.
There's something
I have to talk to you about.
Everyone's saying I shouldn't.
But I think they're wrong.
is fossilized
I'm really trying to tell
you something here.
Go ahead.
I think I'm just going to say it.
I'm just going to say it.
I'm still in love with you, Ross.
I'm not sure what to do
with that right now.
What? Was that a joke?
and it's just ridiculous!
When I said it, I sort of
floated up out of my body.
And then I heard myself say it,
and then the floating Rachel....
I was like, "You are such an idiot!"
-Well, I am married.
since the wedding.
I'm sorry. That's not funny.
Actually, it kind of is.
My wife won't return my calls.
I don't know where my wife is.
"Hey, Ross! Where's the missus?"
"Don't know!"
Oh, God!
You know what?
Could you forget I told you this?
Well, I kind of have to.
Because the thing is
The thing is, you know,
right? Was that stupid?
Me telling you that?
I'm glad you did.
If nothing else...
...it's always great when someone
tells you they love you.
That's what I said!
-Thank you for being so nice.
-No. Thank you for....
Thank you.
Oh, God. I'm just glad I didn't give you
-Oh, you know
-"With or Without You."
-Oh, yeah.
-"Everybody Hurts."
-Oh, yeah.
-"Rhiannon."
In the living room?
On Monica's laundry?
Not me.
Really.
So, what happened?
Well, it was really hard...
...but I'm glad I did it.
So was I right or wrong?
-Oh, come on, honey, does it really matter?
-No.
Yes. I need it for my score book.
Diary.
-Okay, let's go!
-Yeah, Atlantic City!
Come on!
Atlantic City, baby!
Let's roll some bones.
to the hospital now.
Okay. Well, there's probably
one on the way to Atlantic City.
Phoebe, the babies are coming now.
Honey! High-five!
The babies are coming!
Remember when my water broke?
I can't believe Phoebe's going
It's beautiful and amazing.
I can't believe I had to kiss Phoebe
and Rachel every time I left the room.
It's too bad they didn't
see us having sex.
Do you know anything about women?
-It's all right.
babies coming out.
Have you started having contractions?
Not yet. I heard they really hurt.
Do they?
Oh, my God!
Which of you is the father?
None of them are.
The father is my brother.
I'll miss watching you
to look at someday.
Do you want to say anything
before it starts?
Hi, kids! It's me, Aunt Phoebe.
Can't wait to see you.
Please don't hurt me!
What took you so long?
Your cab left when ours did.
We went back because
I did it again!
Someone has to call
Frank and Alice.
My mom might
What are you doing?
I've got to get the "before" shot!
The One Hundredth
We spoke to the nurse.
coming out of your vagina!
Listen. The nurse said
the doctor is wonderful.
He's head of the department.
All right. Oh, dear God, save me!
I'm having my first contraction!
Oh, it's not bad.
And so the miracle of birth begins.
And l
You okay?
Something hurts.
It's sympathy pains.
I'll be delivering your babies.
You'll be in good hands.
I've been doing this a long time.
I'll be back to do your internal.
Just relax, everything looks great.
And also, I love Fonzie.
Did he just say he loves Fonzie?
That's what it sounded like.
All right.
Am I late?
Nobody came out yet, right?
No, we haven't started yet.
I'll be your coach.
Don't worry. She told me
about the LaMazda stuff.
If you get the babies out
by month's end...
...you get two percent financing.
Monica, you're gonna be
unbelievably cute nurses.
Oh, my!
They're male nurses.
Not in my head.
They want to take us out
Saturday night! What do you say?
I don't think so.
What are you talking about?
You've been telling me
to get over Ross and move on.
I'm moving on and so are you.
Why don't you want to go?
Why don't you give me
-Harder than it sounds, isn't it?
You're coming.
And when they get off...
...we'll go get some Jello with them.
There's always room for Jello.
How do you make that dirty?
It's easy.
I can do it with anything.
Grandma's chicken salad....
Get a shot of this.
These are the headlines
And boy babies...
...check it out!
This is what naked women
looked like when you were born.
Now let's dive into the good stuff.
Okay, I'm having another one!
This one doesn't hurt eith
Yes, it does!
I was kind of hoping that was it.
Where are Monica and Rachel, anyway?
A couple of nurses asked them out.
Really? Male nurses?
Yeah, I was bummed too.
So they're going on dates.
-When?
-Sympathy pains.
It was sweet at first, but now I think
he's trying to steal my thunder.
Let's see what we got here.
Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.
This Fonzie person
you keep referring to...
...is that another doctor?
Oh, no, no.
Fonzie is the nickname
telling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo."
He doesn't seem to be
impersonating Fonzie
What are you doing?
Why are you defending him?
Just get me another doctor...
...who isn't crazy
Joey told me.
I am so fine. You and l,
we're just nothing.
Just goofing around.
I was about to tell you
I was getting out of it.
But if we're just "goofing around,"
in the gift shop.
Get up! Get up! Get up!
This is Dr. Oberman.
He has no strong feelings
about Fonzie...
...or any of the Happy Days gang.
You're going into what grade?
I'm actually a first-year resident.
I graduated early.
Me too.
I should have specified
I'm going to be having babies soon?
Go, little boy! Go!
Oh, cool. You made him cry!
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid
you've got kidney stones.
Well, what else could it be?
It's kidney stones.
Or....
Kidney stones.
-lf it was something else?
-Well, that would be "kidney stones."
You're getting there.
These babies are very, very lucky.
They are? Why?
They'll be born
these babies for Frank and Alice.
No, it is.
Can I tell you a secret?
I want to keep one.
Oh, I'm gonna be on the news.
You must be kidding.
You know you can't keep
one of these babies.
Maybe I can. You don't know.
I do. Frank and Alice will
want to keep all their children.
Maybe not. You know?
Three babies are a handful.
Maybe they'll want to unload one.
I hate to miss an opportunity
This is insane.
Just ask him.
What? Me?
I can't ask him!
Do you know how inappropriate
that would be?
All I'm saying is,
just talk to Frank.
Just feel him out.
No. I will not ask Frank
the stones up with shock waves.
But they're too close to the bladder.
Either we wait for you to pass them
or else go up the urethra
No, no, no, no.
Nothing is going up, okay?
Up is not an option.
Mork.
Undo it. Undo it.
Fonzie met Mork.
Mork froze Fonzie.
But Fonzie was already cool.
So he wasn't hurt. Right?
Yeah, that's right.
How you doing?
Okay. Doctor says any minute now.
You know, Alice is going
to be here so soon.
You couldn't just do me a favor
and, like, hold them in?
Sorry, I'm in the middle of
we're dating on Saturday.
Nice to meet you.
I'm really looking forward
to Saturday night. Really!
So, Dan...
...nurse, not a doctor, huh?
Kind of girlie, isn't it?
That's okay. I'm doing this
to get through medical school.
And it didn't feel "girlie"
by the way.
Why wait till Saturday?
Are you free tomorrow?
Sure.
I'll get somebody to cover me.
Great!
Hey, you and me, Saturday night?
-No.
Okay, bye.
That was Alice's mom.
Alice left five hours ago.
She should be here.
She'll make it on time.
So, Frank...
...three babies.
That just seems like a lot, huh?
Not to me.
Fair enough.
You're at ten centimeters.
-Good luck.
I need a clamp, a sterile towel
and Channel .
What is that?
Oh, my God!
Oh, no, no! It's a good one.
Fonzie plays the bongos.
Ready? Time to try pushing.
Ready? Time to try peeing.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
-All right.
Here's your first baby!
Yes! We got a baby boy!
Frank Junior, Junior!
How does he look?
So gross!
Okay. You ready to push again?
I already had a baby.
Leave me alone!
Come on, you can do it!
You can do it!
Little Leslie's here!
I have two children.
How scary is that?
Come on, little Chandler,
it's time to be born.
He's coming!
Yes, he's coming!
Hey, where's his thing?
Chandler's a girl!
Oh, God! Kindergarten flashback.
They read the sonogram wrong,
-No, no. Everything's okay.
There's  fingers and  toes.
We have our babies?
We have our babies.
Oh, my God!
You did it, man.
Would you like to see them?
They're so small.
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-Great.
Are you really going to date
that nurse man?
You and I are just
"goof around" with him?
I don't know if you've looked up
"goofing around" in the dictionary.
Well, I have...
Two friends who care a lot
about each other...
...and have amazing sex...
...and just want to spend
dictionary that gets you mad at me...
...then we have to get you
my original one.
I am so bad at this.
-You're better than you think you are.
-Really?
Okay. So if?
-Know when to stop.
it's not gonna happen.
-Don't do the dance.
-Right.
You're my favorite.
-Which one do you have?
-I don't care.
Frank and Alice want me to tell you
about, you know....
No, honey.
It was a long shot.
You guys? Can I just have
a second alone with the babies?
So here you are.
Seems like yesterday I was talking
to you in that petri dish.
Everyone said labor was
with you guys.
I wish I could take you home
and see you every day.
I'll settle for being
your favorite aunt.
I know Alice's sister has a pool,
You're amazing!
I know.
Does it hurt as bad as they say?
You won't be able to take it.
Now that little Chandler is a girl,
what'll they name her?
They'll call her Chandler.
Kind of a masculine name,
don't you think?
It works on you.
Maybe they can girlie it up a bit,
Monica!
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry! I was
I was taking a nap.
Since when do you
take naps in that position?
Tell me you were waiting for a guy.
Please tell me.
Yes, I was.
a nonthreatening Ray Liotta?
That one!
Give me a second.
I'm just going to grab a jacket.
When I get back,
I want every little detail.
Maybe that's him.
It's just Joey and Ross.
Why aren't you at the movie?
Ross was so loud, they threw us out.
I had to talk loud
-Did he get in touch with Emily?
No, not yet. He's hoping that someone
will help him get in touch with her.
I don't care if I said some
other girl's name, you prissy old twit!
Way to suck up to the family!
I'm so glad you're all here. My office
I'm looking for Emily.
Waltham.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is this -------...
...-------?
Oh, it's "-," not -.
Well, which -?
No, no! Vomit tux!
Don't worry,
I had it dry-cleaned.
Vomit tux?
Who vomited on?
You know what?
this telethon thing on TV.
And my agent
got me a job as cohost!
That's great!
A little good deed for PBS,
plus some TV exposure.
That's the kind of math
-What's right with them?
Why don't you like PBS?
Right after my Mom killed herself,
I was in a bad place, personally.
I thought I'd write
to Sesame Street.
Because they were nice
don't have thumbs.
All I got was a lousy key chain, and
by that time, I was living in a box.
I didn't have keys!
I'm sorry, Phoebe.
I wanted to do a good deed,
like you did with the babies.
This isn't a good deed. You just
those babies for your brother?
That's selfish!
What are you talking about?
It was a nice thing,
but it made you feel good, right?
Yeah, so?
It made you feel good
so that makes it selfish.
Look, there's no
good deeds that are selfless!
May I ask for one example?
Yeah, it's
You know, there's
No, you may not!
Because all people are selfish.
Are you calling me selfish?
Are you calling you people?
Sorry to burst that bubble, Phoebe,
but selfless good deeds don't exist.
You know the deal
I'm going to beat you, you evil genius!
Oh, my God! It's Emily!
It's Emily, everyone!
I'm only ringing to say
stop harassing my relatives. Goodbye.
You can hang up, but I'll keep calling
everyone in England...
...if that's what it takes
We're married.
You know, I love you.
I really miss you.
I miss you too.
At least, I think I do.
She's talking.
When you said "the deal with Santa,"
you meant...?
That he doesn't exist.
Right.
Chandler, have you heard
about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Yeah, she might have mentioned him.
So, Mon, when are we going
up to meeting everyone yet.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to it.
I want to meet this guy
who's the best sex she ever had.
Really?
That's what you heard?
You said that?
I might have.
Why is that funny?
Because I'm very happy for him.
And you!
on the relationship.
That's great!
In London.
She wants me to move to London.
But you live here.
You know that.
-What will you do?
-I don't know.
-I mean, I can't leave Ben.
-You can just video-conference with him.
I'm not ready to have a child.
I bet if I talked to Carol and Susan...
...I could convince them
would be more than happy to move...
...so you can patch things up
with your new wife.
It could happen.
Ross, we are not moving to London.
We already have lives here.
But it'd be great.
-She's a woman.
-Daddy!
-Hey!
Guess what? We're moving to London!
-Who's going to London?
-Nobody's going to London.
Welcome to London, governor.
Right, right. It'll be great
to the -year-old.
Come on, come on.
It'll be just like Three's Company...
...only there's a kid and my wife...
...and you're the gay ones.
How you doing? Welcome.
Good to see you.
This'll be your phone.
That's great.
But I'm not really
and take pledges.
But I'm the host.
Gary Collins is the host.
You'll be answering the phone.
You don't seem to understand.
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.
Well, here's your phone, doctor.
I can't believe I can't find
that lives next to me?
I snuck over there and raked up
the leaves on his front stoop.
But he caught me, and he
force-fed me cider and cookies.
Then I felt wonderful.
Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
I will find a selfless good deed.
I gave birth to three children...
...and I won't let them be raised
in a world where Joey's right!
Can I ask you a cooking question?
If you're cooking on the stove...
...that means your new boyfriend
of my new, secret boyfriend.
Why?
If this guy was me...
...and it's me who'd learned that it was
me who was the best you'd ever had...
All right, Emily.
As much as I love you...
...I'm sorry, I can't
move to London without Ben.
I understand that would be difficult.
Would you consider moving here?
a complete idiot up till now...
...you have to come here.
You have to, so we can
work this out together.
All right.
Did you just say "all right"?
I did.
Now I'm the idiot.
Emily, that is so great!
It'll be great!
We're going to be
really scares me still.
-Yes, tell me.
-You must understand...
...how humiliating it was
for me at the altar...
...in front of my family and friends.
I know. I am so sorry.
And then, after deciding
catching our plane with her.
Again, very sorry.
I mean, I can't be
in the same room as her.
It drives me mad thinking of you
being in the same room as her.
Emily, there is nothing
and we'll try to make this work.
That's so great!
As long as you
don't see Rachel anymore.
I asked Emily
if she would come to New York.
And she said yes.
Great!
Only if I promise
supposed to make this decision?
I'm actually asking you!
Rachel is one of your best friends.
But Emily's his wife!
That's true!
You can't just cut Rachel
out of your life!
That's true!
Thanks for the help.
Problem solved!
When will you be on TV?
There was kind of a mix-up
and that's good exposure.
You're not on TV.
How about now?
There he is!
Hello, New York!
Maybe just put the whole duck in there.
Who cares?
Now I got the legs.
How many times have I told you
to never watch the cooking channel?
I need that broiling pan
was throwing up caterpillars.
Williams-Sonoma,
fall catalog, page .
Expect it in  to  weeks.
Joey's at the telethon
for the rest of the day.
We have the place to ourselves.
Yeah, so?
Maybe you'd want to book some time
would you want to sleep with you?
Well, I think I'd be a little out of my league,
but I'd give it a shot.
PBS Telethon.
I just wanted to let you know
that I found a selfless good deed.
I went down to the park
in front of his bee friends.
The bee is happy,
and I am definitely not.
You know, the bee probably
died after he stung you.
Damn it!
Back on in  seconds, people!
Excuse me,
I'm in the shot, man.
-You've been here all day!
-I'm taking pledges.
And we're on three, two....
Welcome back to our fall telethon.
If you've been enjoying
Cirque du Soleil...
...and you'd like to see more,
is call in a pledge...
...and tell one of our volunteers
what type of programming you
-Quick broiling pan question
-Yes, it really does cost that much.
Maybe next time your duck can puke
It is too difficult.
I leave it entirely
up to the gods of fate.
A Magic  Ball?
You can't make this decision
with a toy!
It's not a toy.
I don't know what else to do!
I either keep my wife
for the second time before I'm .
If anyone else has
a better suggestion, let's hear it.
Because I got nothing!
Don't be shy.
Any suggestion will do.
Okay, then.
Here we go.
Magic  Ball...
...should I never see Rachel again?
"Ask Again Later."
Later is not good enough!
"Ask Again Later."
What the hell?
This is broken! It is broken!
Let me see.
Will Chandler have sex tonight?
"Don't Count On lt."
Seems like it works to me.
Okay, one more time.
Should I never see Rachel again?
Magic  Ball! What did you ask?
Does...
...Rachel get to pick the movie
her groove back tonight!
What? I heard it was good.
PBS Telethon.
Hi, Joey.
Hey, Phoebe.
I'd like
to make a pledge.
I would like to donate $.
Two hundred dollars?
You sure?
After what Sesame Street did to you?
I'm still mad at them,
whose moms didn't kill themselves.
By supporting them, I'm doing a good
thing, but I'm not happy about it.
So there!
A selfless good deed.
You don't feel good
I was saving up to buy a hamster.
A hamster?
Those things are, like, $.
Not the one I had my eye on.
It looks like we have surpassed
last year's pledge total.
Thank you!
And the pledge that did it
one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.
Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
Oh, look!
Joey's on TV!
Isn't that great?
My pledge got Joey on TV!
That makes me feel so
Oh, no!
Look...
...I got carried away before,
but there's something you got to know.
If I'm the best, it's only
and we're together...
...oh, my God!
-Really?
-Oh, my God!
I understand if you never
want to sleep with me again.
But that would be wrong.
We're too good.
We owe it to sex!
If we owe it!
Oh, my!
When will Joey be home?
I was kind of hoping
Leave the gloves on.
I cleaned the bathroom.
Why don't we lose the gloves.
All right.
Let's show them how it's done.
-You know that wasn't part of it?
-I know.
You ready?
-For Stella, remember?
She's getting her groove back
in  minutes.
I totally forgot about that.
Can I take a rain check?
I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Sure, I guess.
I hear you don't have to
a lot of relationship stuff.
Like what?
Just stuff.
You know, kind of what Emily wants.
Talk to me.
Maybe I can help.
You can't help.
I have to do this
without your help.
I know you can do that too.
You'll hate yourself if you don't.
Come on, answer it!
Hi, sweetie.
Good.
Yes, I've been thinking...
...about that thing
you wanted me to do.
I can do it.
Will you come to New York?
-Never done that before.
-Nope.
{}{}What time is it?
{}{}Nine.
{}{}But it's dark out.
{}{}This is what nine looks like.
{}{}I guess I'll get washed up then.
{}{}Watch that sunrise.
{}{}Me too. What if we went away|for the weekend? No interruptions.
{}{}We could be naked|the entire time.
{}{}All weekend?|That's a whole lot of naked.
{}{}I wanted to go to this|culinary fair in Jersey!
{}{}Okay.|You know you're not, though.
{}{}- Let's go.|- Okay. Wait.
{}{}The One with the Kips
{}{}I'm going to a culinary fair|in Jersey this weekend.
{}{}How weird! Chandler just said|he's got a conference there.
{}{}...in Connecticut or Vermont.
{}{}I'm not in charge of where|the conference is held.
{}{}Do you want people to think it's fake?|It's a real conference.
{}{}- Damn!|- What's going on?
{}{}I told Emily to come.
{}{}And I just need to, you know,|talk to Rachel about it.
{}{}When Emily comes,|you won't see Rachel anymore?
{}{}I'm focusing on the|"I get to see my wife" part...
{}{}...and not on the part|that makes me do this.
{}{}How will that even work?
{}{}I have no idea.|I mean...
{}{}But I assure you,|I will figure it out.
{}{}Hi, guys.
{}{}What's going on?
{}{}We're flipping Monica's mattress.
{}{}That's better than my way.
{}{}Hey guys, would you flip mine too?
{}{}Oh, man.
{}{}So, Rach?
{}{}You know how Emily's coming?
{}{}Oh, yeah. I know.
{}{}Yeah, somebody just said,|"Can you hear anything?"
{}{}Hey, Joey's ass.
{}{}What are you doing?
{}{}...and we were stuck here|all night with no food?
{}{}When Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding,|I figured it'd happen again.
{}{}So I hid this in here.
{}{}"Mad Libs"! Mine!
{}{}Condoms?
{}{}You don't know how long|we'll be in here.
{}{}And condoms are the way to do that?
{}{}Anyway, it all boils down to this.
{}{}- The last time I talked to Emily...|- Oh, my God! Our dog died!
{}{}LaPooh's still alive?
{}{}It says he was hit by|an ice-cream truck and dragged for...
{}{}...nineteen blocks!
{}{}- Please don't cry.|- It's LaPooh!
{}{}I know, it's LaPooh right now|but it'll get better.
{}{}I can't believe it! We're here!
{}{}You should live with Joey.|Rolos everywhere.
{}{}I'll be right back.
{}{}Oh, yes!
{}{}We're switching rooms.
{}{}Oh, dear God!|They gave us glasses!
{}{}The glasses have lipstick on them.
{}{}Sweetie...
{}{}...I just want this weekend|to be perfect.
{}{}We can change rooms, can't we?
{}{}You know how there was something|I wanted to talk to you about?
{}{}Oh, yeah.
{}{}I'm trying to work|things out with Emily.
{}{}...one thing.
{}{}Here goes.
{}{}I made a promise that...
{}{}Oh, God!
{}{}You're bleeding.
{}{}Not again.
{}{}Sorry.
{}{}Gross.
{}{}Okay. So I'm sorry.|What did you want to tell me?
{}{}I can't see you anymore.
{}{}I know, it's ridiculous.|I can't see you, either.
{}{}- I think you'll like this room more.|- Okay, great.
{}{}Half a tank? Still lots|of high-speed chasing to do!
{}{}- We're switching rooms again.|- What? Why?
{}{}This has a garden view.|We paid for an ocean view.
{}{}Excuse me. Can I talk to you|over here for just a second?
{}{}These clowns want to take us|for a ride. I won't let them.
{}{}We're not a couple of suckers.
{}{}All these rooms are fine.
{}{}Just pick one so I can watch the...
{}{}Have a perfect, magical|weekend together with you?
{}{}Nothing. It's over. Damn it!
{}{}This is regularly scheduled|programming!
{}{}Can we turn the TV off?
{}{}Am I getting in the way|of the room-switching fun?
{}{}Don't blame me for tonight.
{}{}Who should I blame?|The nice bellman?
{}{}...from Albany to Canada|on half a tank of gas?
{}{}Do not speak ill of the dead.
{}{}We're supposed to be spending|a romantic weekend together.
{}{}I just want to watch|a little television.
{}{}Jeez, relax, Mom.
{}{}What did you say?
{}{}I've been wanting to tell you something|and I just have to get it out.
{}{}Okay. What's up?
{}{}You know how you said to do|whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
{}{}And while that was good advice,|you should know that what she wants...
{}{}...is for me not to see you anymore.
{}{}That's crazy! You can't do that.|What are you going to tell her?
{}{}You've already agreed to this.
{}{}It's awful, I know.
{}{}But I have to do this|if I want my marriage to work.
{}{}But the good thing is, we can still|see each other until she gets here.
{}{}Lucky me! Oh, my God!|That is good news, Ross!
{}{}That's the best news I've heard|since LaPooh died!
{}{}Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross?
{}{}- Let me make this easier for you.|- What are you doing?
{}{}- Storming out.|- It's your apartment.
{}{}Damn Rolos!
{}{}You're back!|How was your conference?
{}{}It was terrible. I fought with|my colleagues for the entire time.
{}{}So your weekend was a bust?
{}{}No, I got to see Donald Trump|waiting for an elevator.
{}{}You're back too.
{}{}- How was your chef thing?|- It was awful.
{}{}Some people don't|appreciate good food.
{}{}Maybe the food tasted good at first...
{}{}How much was the room?|I'll pay my half.
{}{}Fine. $.
{}{}$?
{}{}What are you guys woofing about?
{}{}Chandler stole a  from my purse!
{}{}You know what?|Now that I think about it...
{}{}...always have lots.
{}{}You should've seen|the look on her face.
{}{}I don't want Rachel to hate me.|I don't know what to do.
{}{}- You won't like it.|- That's okay.
{}{}You got married too fast.
{}{}- That's not advice.|- I told you.
{}{}If anyone asked me to give up|any of you, I couldn't do it.
{}{}Me neither.
{}{}Maybe I could do it.
{}{}But I've been obsessing about it|and would love not to talk about it.
{}{}I don't know if this falls|under that category...
{}{}...but Ross is right back there.
{}{}He does look like him, though.
{}{}Ross is in the bathroom.
{}{}Oh, my God! It's happening.|It's already started. I'm Kip.
{}{}Do you even know who Kip is?
{}{}Who cares? You're Rachel.
{}{}Who's Kip?
{}{}Oh, that poor bastard.
{}{}You told me the story.|He and Monica dated.
{}{}When they broke up, you all|promised you'd stay his friend.
{}{}- You won't be phased out.|- Of course, I am.
{}{}It won't happen to Ross. He's your|brother, your college roommate.
{}{}It was just a matter of time.
{}{}You live far away,|you're not related.
{}{}You lift right out.
{}{}Hey, Mr. Bing.
{}{}Someone left an eyelash curler|in your room.
{}{}Yes, that was mine.
{}{}I figured you met|a girl and she left it.
{}{}I don't even feel like|I know you anymore.
{}{}All right, I'm just going|to ask you this one time.
{}{}Whatever you say,|I'll believe you.
{}{}...on a gay cruise?
{}{}I'm sorry about the whole|"lifting out" thing.
{}{}You got to come with me.
{}{}You and me, we'll start a new group.|We're the best ones.
{}{}Okay, but try to get Joey too.
{}{}Pheebs, do you mind if I|speak to Rachel alone?
{}{}Bye, Ross.
{}{}Forever.
{}{}Why are you here?|Isn't this against the rules?
{}{}Look, I'm the one|who made the choice.
{}{}I'm the one who's making|things change.
{}{}So I should be the one to,|you know, step back.
{}{}Plenty of people just see their|sisters at Thanksgiving...
{}{}...their college roommates|at reunions...
{}{}...and Joey at Burger King.
{}{}No, it's not better.
{}{}I still don't get to see you.
{}{}What would you do?|If you were me, what would you do?
{}{}I can't believe this.
{}{}I know.
{}{}I am so sorry.
{}{}Hey, Rach?
{}{}Sorry to interrupt, but Phoebe said|you want to talk to me about a trip?
{}{}I just came over to drop off...
{}{}So that weekend kind of sucked.
{}{}Yeah, it did.
{}{}So I guess this is over?
{}{}Why exactly?
{}{}Because of the weekend.|We had a fight.
{}{}Chandler, that's crazy.
{}{}...you'd never be with anyone|longer than...
{}{}This isn't over?
{}{}You are so cute!
{}{}You deal with it and you move on.|It's nothing to freak out about.
{}{}Really? Okay, great!
{}{}Welcome to an adult relationship.
{}{}I'm afraid so.
{}{}I heard you saw Donald Trump|at your convention.
{}{}Saw him waiting for an elevator.
{}{}It's in the bathroom.
{}{}Can I talk to you for a second?
{}{}Yes.
{}{}You?
{}{}And you?
{}{}But you cannot tell anyone.|No one knows.
{}{}- It happened in London.|- In London!
{}{}We didn't want to make|a big deal out of it.
{}{}But it is a big deal!|I have to tell someone!
{}{}We just don't want to deal with|telling everyone.
{}{}Please just promise you won't tell.
{}{}All right.
{}{}I mean, it's great!
{}{}But...
{}{}I know. It's great!
{}{}We're so stupid.
{}{}Do you know what's going on in there?|They're trying to take Joey!
{}{}"The most popular Phoebe in tennis|is called the overhand Phoebe."
{}{}That's cute.|We really all enjoyed it.
{}{}- But it doesn't count.|- For what?
{}{}Just count in our heads|as good Mad Libs.
{}{}Wait, if we follow the rules...
{}{}...it's still fun|and it means something.
{}{}I'm going to take off.
{}{}Rules help control the fun.
Not while you're under my roof!
Just because I know about you
doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Aren't you supposed to be
at an audition?
I'm sorry I'm not
I go to the wrong audition.
If I pretend to not know about you...
...then you pretend
there's nothing to know.
Sorry.
I can hear that!
Rachel's at work.
I can still hear you!
The One With the Yeti
What's that?
My mom sent me an heirloom
that belonged to my grandmother.
Can you believe it?
A year ago I had no family,
was a feather boa.
Got if from my dad.
He got it from his dad.
How did I ever get born?
Oh, God!
Soft.
Is this mink?
Why would my mother send me a fur?
Doesn't she know me but at all?
I have a fine coat that no innocent
their fingers bloody...
...for  cents an hour.
I made that up.
You can't put up flyers in here.
How come?
Everybody else does.
You can't.
What is that?
I'm getting rid of some things.
This is all of your things.
Yes, it is.
It's good. Emily thinks
we should get all new stuff.
Stuff that's just ours.
Rachel-ever-touched sale.
Touched, used, sat on, slept on....
I'll take it all.
You're okay with that?
If I can just do what Emily wants...
...and get her to New York,
it will be fine.
Isn't that a little extreme?
After what I did, can you blame her?
You got off easy.
When my friend's husband said
another name in bed...
...she cursed him
has got Rachel cooties?
Calm down, Joey.
Everything's getting all messed up!
Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.
We won't stop seeing Rachel.
Hence, Ross stops seeing us.
I hate this.
Everything's changing.
We're losing Ross.
Joey said "hence."
I'm not happy about this either,
our feelings to ourselves.
Are you cool with that?
But, you know, I'm an actor.
I'll act cool.
Probably be some of the hardest acting
I've ever done.
Maybe I'll play it with a mustache.
Storage rooms give me the creeps.
Please hurry up, honey.
If you want little round waffles,
wait till I find the iron.
I want the little round waffles.
Here it is!
Right underneath the can of bug bomb.
Is the best place to put something
I'll have toast.
Fog him! Fog him!
I don't know what to do
about this coat.
I'll take it.
That might work.
What do you think?
You're on in five, Ms. Minnelli.
No, it's just a bit sudden.
It's great, okay?
I am totally onboard.
I love you too.
to a new apartment.
Why?
Her thought is, and I agree...
...fresh new furniture,
why not a fresh new apartment?
Her cousin has a place to sublet.
It's got a view
of the river and Columbia.
That's way uptown!
on the commute.
I've been given the gift of time.
That's so funny. Last Christmas
I got the gift of space.
We should get them together
and make a continuum.
Now he's moving?
Man, what is Emily doing to him?
He's not even here!
You guys!
We were in the storage area,
hairy beast-man.
It was like a Big Foot
or a yeti or something.
He came at us,
so Rachel used a bug bomb on him.
I pulled the tab
trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
He's nice.
You know, you always...
...stick up for the people we fog.
You might not remember us,
but we're the girls that fogged you.
We're really sorry we fogged you.
Just so you know,
like a yeti or something.
Sorry to bother you, but we can't
accept your acceptance of our apology.
It doesn't really seem
like you mean it.
That guy is so rude!
Really!
I'm so sorry.
-I totally forgive you.
-Really?
You know my friend Chris
who owns the crematorium?
Crematorium Chris? Sure.
He said he would cremate
I know who dies.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Look at these pelts!
Don't get too attached.
She's having it cremated.
You're quirky, and I get a big kick
a coat like this...
...that is like a crime
against nature.
Not nature. Fashion!
This is fashion?
So to you, death is fashion?
That's funny.
Here's Phoebe...
...sporting cutting-edge
hairy carcass...
...from, you know, the steel traps
I can't wait to see you.
I love you. Bye.
What is in here, rocks?
No, it's my collection
of fossil samples.
So, rocks.
I'll miss this apartment.
You know, Ben took his first steps
right over there.
Remember when I ran into this
I wish I didn't have to move.
Are you saying that you're not
entirely happy about this?
If Emily gave me a choice
You do have a choice!
Why are you listening to her?
Are you crazy?
It's not right what Emily wants
if Ross was happy, right?
He just told me
that he's not entirely happy.
What's going on?
We all hate Emily!
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.
We just think that
you're having to sacrifice...
...a whole lot to make her happy.
We just think that maybe
when one of you marries?
You have no idea what it takes
to make a marriage work.
It's compromise.
Do you always like it? No.
Do you do it? Yes.
Because it's not all laughing,
the coffeehouse way too much.
-I feel so guilty about Ross.
-I know.
I kind of feel like it's my fault.
Kind of?
You should have kept this to yourself.
I'm keeping so many things to myself,
something was bound to slip out!
I think it's very brave
I have to walk places.
What's with the coat?
How about the animal rights thing?
I've been reading up,
and for your information...
...minks aren't very nice.
-So they deserve to be killed?
I love this coat, okay?
It's the best thing I ever had wrapped
around me, including Phil Huntley.
Remember Phil Huntley?
He was fine.
So you like the short hair better?
Yeti? Danny?
I had to cut my hair to get rid of...
...the fogger smell.
Listen, I'm so sorry.
are just into appearances.
What?
It's cool.
No, that is not cool.
You don't even know me.
You got the shopping bags
and the Saks catalog.
From that, you've got me
all figured out?
Well, you don't.
You know, I could have toys
with capri pants.
Stop saying that.
I hate that!
I judged you.
I made a snap judgment.
But you did it too, and you're worse.
you might be wrong.
What does that say about you?
That pizza place
across the street any good?
I'm hungry.
You want some pizza?
You can keep yelling.
Stop saying that.
I'm not in the mood.
Look, Ross.
I feel really bad.
You're going through all this stuff...
...and I just acted like a jerk.
-We are so sorry.
-You're stepping on the song.
We were way out of line, all right?
whatever you do.
Now you're just taking lines
out of the song.
This is hard enough, okay?
I really need you guys right now.
Yes, exactly! And that's why....
Why don't you come over tonight,
a seeing-eye dog coat!
You know, I think I kind of
understand why I lost it today.
You do, huh?
You see...
...I'm an actor, right?
So I got to keep my emotions
right at the surface.
I got a lot of balls in the air,
you wander around, you're alone.
What are you talking about?
I'm not sure.
Look at you!
Where have you been?
I went to have pizza.
With Danny.
-What happened?
-That yeti is one smooth talker.
Yetis are smooth-talkers. That's why
Dinner's almost ready.
I think I'll probably
just hang out in my room.
Why?
Come on, you guys!
If Emily knew I was having dinner
with you, she'd flip out.
It's okay.
Just stay.
Please.
It would mean a lot for me
if you stay.
Ross, I just
Please, just have dinner with us!
Settle down.
All right. I'm sorry.
You see, Rach, I'm an actor.
Hey, look!
Ugly Naked Guy's back.
We haven't seen him in so long.
Oh, God! I really missed
the last time we hang out together.
It's almost as if he knew.
I'll get it.
Hi, Emily.
You tracked him down.
Hold on.
Yeah, we're just having dinner.
Sure, hold on.
She wants to say hi.
Hi, Emily!
Hello, everyone.
So who am I saying hello to?
Well, I don't know
about who's here...
...but I can tell you who's not here,
Ross knows better than that by now.
You know what?
Rachel is here.
She's there?
Oh, yeah, there she is!
She's here.
Take me off speakerphone.
How could you do this to me?
I made my feelings about Rachel
perfectly clear.
I'm just having dinner
-That's ridiculous.
-Hello? Hello?
-Who is this?
It's Ross. What are you doing?
Sorry, dude, I had to make a call.
Joey.
Joey, they don't have two lines,
they have two phones.
Gotcha.
I'm sorry. Emily, listen.
friends out of my life for you.
Please, get on the plane
and come to New York, okay?
You're the only one
I want to be with.
I'll feel better when I'm there.
all the time.
This marriage will never work
if you don't trust me.
You're right.
Can you trust me?
I think it's going okay.
Looks like he's smiling.
How can you tell?
You can only see his back.
You can totally tell!
Here, look, watch me.
Smile.
Frown. Smile.
Frown.
Smile.
I guess that's it.
Why? What happened?
My marriage is over.
Look at you, you're shivering.
Here.
Honey, is there anything we can do?
You can help me
and they hate squirrels.
Most of these probably
wanted to be coats.
Fine. No, I get it.
Here.
You take it.
Are you happy now?
I'm cold!
Are you looking at naked tribeswomen?
No, look.
That's a pig.
I know.
-Why?
When you sublet
from your wife's cousin...
...then you divorce, sometimes
the cousin wants his apartment back.
Didn't you sign a lease?
Who needs a lease when it's "family"?
You can stay with us.
Anything you need.
But you have to let us know
I'm going to get packing again.
I've been moving around so much
that I feel like a nomad.
-What?
-He thought you said gonad.
The One Where Ross Moves ln
If every place were this clean,
work on commission?
No, bribes.
-It's okay to laugh?
-I was just kidding.
-I'll check the kitchen floor.
-Knock yourself out.
I don't get violations.
my kitchen floor.
A ninety-eight.
I deducted two points
for not wearing your hat.
That is a Section  violation.
Now look, Larry, honey.
I wrote the book on Section .
You only need to wear it
in the kitchen.
-Where's your hat?
that book you wrote.
You saw the hat in the kitchen and
knew she'd go in hatless to get it.
You could have your own
health inspector detective show.
I don't know about that.
But then I could be
to dinner sometime?
She would love that...
...since you know
all the clean places to eat.
I'll call you.
He's so funny!
Thank you.
How's Ross doing
since all the Emily stuff?
He's not great.
But he's dealing with it.
with all that Ross stuff again.
He'll be screwed up for a long time.
Besides, I don't go for guys
right after they get divorced.
Right, you only go for them
five minutes before they get married.
-Two pounds of mocha java.
He hasn't called since we went out.
I see him in the hallway.
And then nothing.
Wow, thirsty.
I'm having a party on Saturday.
Sort of a housewarming thing.
-Fun.
be warming his house.
All right, I see what he's doing.
He's not asking me out
because he wants me to ask him out.
And you won't do that.
That's right!
Because that would give him
the control.
So now he comes up with this
for an invitation.
Blew up in his face, didn't it?
So there is no party?
No, there's a party.
There's a party.
But the power?
That is still up for grabs.
You follow me?
I think so.
So he won't invite you to his party
because he likes you?
Exactly!
Then why didn't he invite me?
To throw me off.
Hey, roomies!
I love what you've done
-Not a problem.
Since you'll be here a while...
...we could put your name
on the answering machine.
I hope you don't mind...
...but I kind of already
jazzed it up a little.
Check it out.
We will
We will call you back
Pretty cool.
-You're fake laughing too, right?
Who knows where these have been?
You are just nonstop!
-We're out of here.
-Why?
I saw   violations.
I'm shutting this place down!
-You have the power to do that?
Ross' air purifier.
All I heard for four years
through college was....
You should have gone out
once in a while.
-I hate this thing!
He needs us right now.
So why don't you be a grownup
and come watch TV in the fort?
Can't believe that Larry closed down
Churman's. I love that place.
You should have heard
I'm going to be busy.
You are?
Remember, I've got that gala?
What's the gala for?
It's a regatta gala.
Do you sail?
No, but I support it.
I hope I see you tomorrow night.
Take care.
Walked right into that one,
didn't he?
What one?
You wanted him to invite you
So if I said yes...
...he'd know I had nothing better
to do than wait for his invitation.
But I said no...
...which puts me back
in the driver's seat.
So the ball is in his court?
Ball?
No, there's no ball.
Hey, Phoebe, you want to join us?
-Oh, sure, yeah. Where is this from?
something about Sun Ling.
Oh, no, thank you.
Joey, please.
Sorry.
Hello, children.
You want to play some foosball?
Please?
We moved the table into my room
because of all the boxes.
Come on!
I have one question.
What is the deal with this?
Bye-bye, little puppet Joey hand?
No, the quiet down thing.
You mean this.
I don't know how much more
tape with a show about bugs?
My God!
What if that had been porn?
All right, this may be tough...
...but it's Ross.
I survived college with him.
I guess I can hold out
a little longer.
Let's have a game.
Fellas?
So he's out of here.
Got anything to eat?
violated, so we shut it down.
If this guy keeps closing our
favorite places, where will we eat?
I don't know. Clean places?
Yum!
It's Danny.
Don't let him in!
I'm supposed to be at a gala.
We'll be right there.
starts at night?
The fake kind.
-I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
-We have a ladle.
See you at the party.
You know what Larry would say?
He'd say, "See you ladle."
I'm done. You want anything?
though there's never anything here.
Not even on page seven?
You're right.
Here's an affordable place.
Two-bedroom, close to work.
It's available in five weeks.
What about that circled one?
It's kind of expensive for a studio.
But it's available now.
Isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Let's go look at it!
There we go!
Guys, would you chip in for some
we are all using it.
Let's go quicker!
Oh, my God!
Look at this kitchen/bathroom.
That's great!
So you can cook while in the tub.
Somebody was using his head.
Let's check out
the rest of the place.
I think this is it.
I don't know.
with us for five weeks.
So you think I should
take this place?
It's perfect!
How about you?
Kitchen, slash, bathroom.
I see what you guys are saying.
I'll go downstairs
and fill out an application.
We are bad people.
He knew we were trying
in our kitchen?
Ready for dinner?
-Absolutely.
-Great.
You wanted to go to
the ltalian place on Bleecker St.?
I love that place!
So, no.
How about Mama Lozetti's?
Sure.
How long has that milk
I bought this today...
...because I was thirsty for milk,
you know?
Okay, let's go.
Hey, buddy.
Health Code   B requires that refuse
be taken out the back exit.
But then I have to go
over health?
Would you be interested in a free coffee?
Stop, Larry.
Can't you just be Larry and not
Larry the health inspector guy?
It was exciting at first.
But now, it's like, so where
are we going to eat ever?
I suppose I could give him a warning.
Thank you.
Go, go!
If, after dinner,
who picks his nose.
Maybe we did good,
helping Ross get back on his feet.
That was a nice place.
No closet space, but he could hang
his stuff out the window in a bag.
What do we do?
I don't know.
Maybe pizza?
About Ross!
It's the apartment manager.
He's very reliable
Of course, he has a big, huge dog
that barks into the night.
Well, who doesn't love dogs?
He's a tap dancer.
Yes, some would say
that is a lost art.
He's a pimp!
There you go. He's a pimp.
He's a big, tap-dancing pimp!
-Okay, honey, I'm ready.
and I will be all, you know
"l don't need this,
I'm coming from a regatta gala."
Did you get this out of a book?
Monica, honey, this is as real as it gets.
This is never going to work.
He's right there.
Just go say hi.
I have to go downstairs and back up,
But don't be sexy.
What's going on?
This is a great party.
Great food.
You know, most parties, it's all
chips and salsa, chips and salsa.
So....
What's this?
Salad.
And what's this?
Bread.
Aren't you a chef?
Right, tonight was your party.
You look great!
the gala had to end sometime.
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
Whose court is the ball in now?
I thought there wasn't a ball.
Come on. He's glad I came.
He doesn't want me to go anywhere.
Ball's flying all over the place.
This is my friend, Tom.
This is the girl I told you about.
Come on!
could really hit it off.
I'm gonna go mingle.
So you work at Bloomingdale's?
My mom calls it "Bloomies."
At ease, soldier!
I'm sorry?
You can just drop the act.
I know what's going on.
You're Danny's wingman, right?
You guys are best buds, frat bros.
I'm going to go talk to a friend.
Yeah, you go talk to your friend.
Go tell him, "Nice try."
He just keeps lobbing them up...
...and I keep knocking them
Some problem with my application.
You're kidding?
But Phoebe said I could stay
at her place for a while, so....
Well, you can't stay with Phoebe.
We're roomies.
You don't need me
There's still some by that speaker.
Please, just stay.
Are you sure?
-Definitely.
-You have to stay.
So I'm a pimp, huh?
It's okay.
Sometimes I can be a pain in the ass.
But just talk to me.
Tell me if something bothers you.
And I'll do everything I can
a very productive day.
The cowboy hat's a little much.
Come on, it's fun!
All right.
Isn't this a woman's hat?
Stop talking crazy, and make us tea!
Monica, that was the best
Thanksgiving dinner ever.
It was so good.
I think you killed us.
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
I need something sweet.
Does anyone want to watch TV?
Monica, your remote doesn't work.
You have to lift it and point.
Oh, forget it.
Let's play that game where everyone
beautiful fall we've been having.
Very nice.
The other day,
I was at the bus stop...
...and this lovely fall breeze came
and blew this chick's skirt up.
Which reminds me,
as a feat of engineering.
It's amazing...
...how much they can do
with so little material.
And they play with your mind.
Is it there? Is it not there?
Are you aware that
besides a thong?
I don't know. Am I more thankful
for my divorce or my eviction?
And I didn't think you'd be able
to come up with anything.
I'm sorry. This is
marriage and take that away from me.
You're not going to tell about your
parents' divorce again, are you?
Come on! I want to hear it.
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving
without Chandler bumming us out.
It's a tradition, like the parade.
If the parade decided it was gay
we're getting a divorce...
...doesn't mean we don't love you.
It just means...
...he would rather sleep
with the houseboy than with me.
More turkey, Mr. Chandler?
Every time you tell that story,
that guy's accent gets thicker and thicker.
So are he and your dad still together?
No. After they got their own place,
You're the king of bad Thanksgivings.
I've got one that's worse.
Really? Worse than,
"More turkey, Mr. Chandler?"
Did the little rich boy
have a problem with the butler?
Yes, mine's worse!
More bandages!
More bandages!
Please, can I get
remembering stuff like that.
I don't have any past-life memories.
Of course, you don't, sweetie.
You're brand-new.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Let's not tell this story.
I know!
It's the one where Joey got
Monica's turkey stuck on his head.
Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?
It's not like it sounds.
It's exactly like it sounds.
What's going on?
Oh, my God!
I know!
It's stuck!
Step.
How did it get on?
I put it on to scare Chandler.
Oh, my God! Monica's going to
You have your head up a dead animal's ass.
Did you get the turkey?
Oh, my God!
Who is that?
It's Joey.
Is this supposed to be funny?
It's not supposed to be funny.
It's supposed to be scary.
Get that off now!
I can't. It's stuck!
It has to feed  people. They're
not going to eat it off your head!
Hold on.
Let's just all think.
I got it!
You pull.
I'll spread the legs
I scared you! I knew it!
I'm here, big guy.
Yeah, you are!
I scared you!
You did look like an idiot.
I wasn't the only one
who looked like an idiot.
Remember when Ross tried to say
"butternut squash"...
...and it came out,
That's my worst Thanksgiving.
That can't be the one Rachel meant.
She didn't even know that happened.
So, what's yours?
I really don't want
to tell this story.
Reliving pain and getting depressed
is what Thanksgiving's all about.
For me, anyway.
And, of course, the lndians.
Of all people, you do not want me
-I'll get it!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Not for me.
Chip and I broke up.
Why?
What happened?
My parents are out of town,
and Chip was going to come over.
And you were going to give him...
...your "flower."
Monica, can you just call it sex?
It really creeps me out
when you call it that.
And by the way...
...while we're at it, a guy's thing
so I hope you're hungry.
Chandler hates Thanksgiving
and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
I'm so glad you brought him here.
I can make you some
macaroni and cheese for dinner.
As long as the Pilgrims
I've been away at college?
Not really.
That's cool.
So that's Rachel, the girl you've been
writing all those songs about?
Might want to rethink the lyrics to
"She Feels Weird Since I've Been Gone."
I cannot believe Chip dumped me
I don't care how much he begs.
His begging days are over, now
that he's with Nancy Branson.
I've just had it
with high-school boys.
They're just silly.
They're just silly, stupid boys.
I'll start dating men.
I'm sorry, Judy.
I couldn't find that bowl
the macaroni and cheese?
It was great.
You should be a chef.
Guess what.
All this stuff about Nancy
being a slut was all a rumor.
Chip dumped her, and he wants
-I know.
Oh, gosh. Listen,
if you and Chip do it tonight...
...promise me
you'll tell me everything.
Totally. It's not that big a deal.
whether or not you did it.
I know.
And Chip promised that this time
it'd last at least for an entire song.
I'm thinking of asking
Rachel out tonight...
...maybe playing her that song
Right on!
But don't take long.
We're testing our fake lD's tonight.
Right, Clifford Alvarez?
Listen, Roland Cheng...
...if things go well,
I may be out with her all night.
Dude, don't do that to me.
It's cool, you can stay here.
to be stuck here with your fat sister.
Why don't you finish off these pies?
I don't have any more room
in the fridge.
No, thank you.
Judy, you did it.
She's finally full!
I called you fat?
-I don't even remember that.
-Maybe it'd jog your memory...
...if you guys played
for crying out loud!
I can't believe you called her fat.
I can't believe you let
George Michael slap you.
I am really sorry.
That is terrible. I'm so sorry.
That's not the Thanksgiving
I was talking about.
Yes, it was.
No, it was actually
Thanksgiving's over.
but, you know, whatever.
You changed your major again?
I had to.
There was never any parking
by the psychology building.
Love your new nose!
Dr. Wolfson's an artist.
He removed my mole cluster.
Want to see?
No! Please, let me.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Your hair sure is different.
We were just talking about that.
We can't believe
how stupid we used to look.
Where's Monica?
She's upstairs.
Come down, everyone's here!
Ross, Rachel...
...and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
Oh, my God!
What's the matter?
Is there something on my dress?
You look so different.
Terrific.
That dress, that body....
-Dude!
and the golf team.
Can you believe it?
She plays for both teams.
So I guess I'll see you at dinner.
-Dude!
-Sorry.
Oh, my God!
That was so awesome.
You got him back
for calling you fat.
He was drooling all over you.
-That must have felt so great.
not in trouble anymore.
I just don't feel
like I got him back.
I just want to humiliate him.
I want him to be naked, and
I want to point at him and laugh.
That, we may be able to do.
How?
Guys tend to get naked
and lose weight...
...just so I could give my flower
to someone like him.
First of all, if you keep calling it that,
no one will take it.
And then second of all,
think that you are.
I'll throw him out
in the yard, lock the door...
...and all our neighbors
will just humiliate him!
You'll definitely get him back.
How do I make him think
turns you on.
What do you mean?
Anything can be sexy.
Like this dish towel.
This feels so good against my cheek.
And if I get a little hot,
I can just dab myself with it.
Or I can bring it down to my side
and run it through my fingers...
...while I talk to him.
I can do that.
Good, good, good.
Get busy. He's coming.
Hey, what's up?
Could you make me some of that
against my cheek.
And I love carrots.
Sometimes I like to put them
between my fingers.
Like this.
And hold them down here
while I talk to you.
And, you know, if I get really hot...
...I like to pick up this knife.
And I put the cool steel...
...against...
...my body.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Twenty-year-old male.
He's got a severed toe
do that feet first?
You know where his injury is.
Severed toe, you just said it!
It says the knife went
through your shoe.
They're made of wicker!
Did you bring the toe?
I have it right here on ice.
Toes on Ice, coming soon
We'll just reattach it and then....
What is it?
You brought a carrot.
This isn't your toe. This is a small,
very cold piece of carrot.
You brought a carrot?
Oh, my God!
There's a toe in my kitchen.
I'm sorry! I'll go get it!
All we can do now
is sew up the wound.
Without my toe? I need my toe!
I can go really fast!
Because I called you fat?
I didn't mean to cut it off.
It was an accident.
That's why for an entire year
people called me Sir Limps-a-lot?
I'm sorry.
It wasn't your whole toe.
Yeah, well, I miss the tip.
It's the best part.
It has the nail.
Sir Limps-a-lot.
I came up with that.
You're a dork.
-I can't believe this.
that cried all the way home.
It figures that something like this
would happen today.
I hate this stupid day
and everything about it!
I'll see you later.
Wait.
Come here.
Is there anything I can do?
I go quack-quack.
I'm happy all the time.
Nice try.
Wait, wait, wait.
Look, Monica
This is not going to work.
I bet this will work.
You're so great.
I love you.
Nothing. I said you're so great,
and then I just stopped talking.
You said you loved me.
I can't believe this!
No, I didn't!
Yes, you did!
No, I didn't!
You love me!
No, I don't!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Gauze!
Gauze!
I need to get some gauze in here!
Can I please get some more gauze?
This is getting ridiculous.
What am I sitting on?
Top of the world?
Dock of the bay?
I'm out.
Oh, undies!
Whose are they?
-Whose are they?
Got to be Joey's.
They're mine.
See, Joey's.
They're Joe-Joe-Joey's.
Why are they here?
I don't know.
I'm Joey.
I'm disgusting.
I take my underwear off
in other people's homes.
Get them out of here.
-I got them.
You can touch them.
They're yours.
Chandler? A word?
I'm tired of covering for you two.
This has got to stop.
Tighty-whiteys?
You guys keep embarrassing me.
Yesterday, Rachel found
your razor in our bathroom.
I said it was mine, and that
I was playing a woman in a play.
Then one thing led
that is a tough spot.
It was.
All right, listen
All this lying has been
hard on us too.
Yeah, I bet all the sex
underwear in my face...
...and asking when she can
come see me star in Ugly Woman.
We'll be more careful.
We don't want them to know
because it's going really well.
And maybe it's going well
but we're so bad at relationships.
-We are. Help us!
-Help!
All right.
But you do it with me once.
-Joey!
-But I don't get it.
Does anybody else just take off
their underwear when they're hot?
What are you reading?
Wuthering Heights.
I have to finish it by tomorrow
for my literature class.
You're taking a class?
that Lamaze class I took.
I thought this time I'd go
for something more intellectual...
...with a less painful final exam.
That sounds like fun.
Oh, you should come with me!
Then I'll have someone to sit with.
Do you have time to read it?
I read it in school.
This is going to be so much fun!
I have to finish.
But what time does the class start?
What's wrong, buddy?
Someone at work ate my sandwich.
What did the police say?
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.
I can't believe someone ate it.
It's just a sandwich.
Just a sandwich?
I am  years old, okay?
I'll be divorced twice and
the only good thing in my life!
Someone ate the only good thing
going on in my life!
That's a nice sweater vest.
I have enough
for one more sandwich.
I was going to eat it myself, but....
Mon, that would be incredible.
someone ate it!
Look, I left a note and everything.
"Knock-knock."
"Who's there?"
"Ross Geller's lunch."
"Ross Geller's lunch, who?"
"Ross Geller's lunch.
Please don't take me. Okay?"
I'm surprised
Scare people off.
I learned that on the street.
Really?
What would you say, Phoebe?
Stuff like
"Keep your mitts off my grub."
Do you picture Phoebe on the street
with the entire cast of Annie?
This'll keep them away
how I stabbed the cop.
He stabbed me first!
The Bronte sisters were remarkable women
for their time.
They lived in a patriarchal society.
Sorry I'm late,
but I left late.
So, what is the book about?
Didn't you read it
there was this pep rally.
And I was on top of the pyramid.
But anyway...
...what's the book about?
It's a tragic love story
between Cathy and Heathcliff.
It takes place on these
creepy moors in England.
Which I think represent the wildness
the theme of this book?
Let's see....
Rachel Greene?
I would have to say
that it's a tragic love story.
That's sort of a given...
...but, yes.
of Heathcliff's character.
Excellent! What Rachel
has shrewdly observed here....
You completely stole my answer!
Honey, that was pretty obvious.
How would you know?
You didn't read it!
What do you think?
with many possible answers.
Would you care to venture one?
Would you care to venture one?
Are you just repeating me?
Are you just repeating me?
All right. Let's move on.
Okay, then.
Why didn't you say
you hadn't read the book?
I didn't want him
to think I was stupid.
That was really embarrassing,
touch my sandwich...
...but people at work are
actually afraid of me.
A guy called me "Mental."
"Mental Geller."
I've always wanted
a cool nickname like that.
The best you got in high school
reports for me...
...pushing back deadlines
to fit my schedule.
I tell you,
you get tough with people...
...and you can get
Give me that coffee! Now!
This was really fun.
I've been wondering
if you'd ask me out.
So you still wondering?
No. We just went out.
You're smart.
I like that.
Oh, candles!
What is that, a blanket?
A video camera?
Oh, my God!
I can't believe you thought you'd
What are you, sick?
I'm Joey.
I mean, I'm disgusting.
I make low-budget adult films.
You promised to be more careful!
The good Joey name's been
dragged through the mud!
We're so sorry.
I'm telling everyone.
It's the only explanation that
doesn't make me look like a pig!
No, there's a better explanation.
Tell them you had to make
But no!
How does that explain
my underwear at your place?
I don't know.
Get ready to come out
of the non-gay closet.
I promise to come up with something.
look really good.
And another thing
The video camera?
Nice!
May I have a word?
Of course, Donald.
We've been getting reports
of very angry behavior on your part.
-What?
-Threatening letters...
...refusal to meet deadlines.
Apparently people now
to a psychiatrist.
You don't understand.
This is so silly.
This is all just
because of a sandwich.
A sandwich?
You see, my sister makes
of gravy-soaked bread in the middle.
I call it "The Moistmaker."
Anyway, I put my sandwich
in the fridge....
Oh, you know what?
I'm sorry.
I believe I ate that.
You ate my sandwich?
A simple mistake.
It can happen to anyone.
Oh, really?
Did you confuse it with your own
or limerick of some kind.
That said it was...
...my sandwich!
Now, calm down.
Look in my office.
Some may be in the trash.
It was quite large.
I had to throw most of it away.
You threw my sandwich away?
My sandwich?!
What's this book about?
You didn't read it, either?
I was going to, but I accidentally
don't be such a goody-goody.
Fine.
All right.
So, Jane Eyre?
First, you'd think she's a woman,
but she's not.
She's a cyborg.
A cyborg?
ahead of its time.
Sorry I'm late.
Let's get started.
What did you think of Jane Eyre?
Rachel and I were discussing it,
and she had very interesting insights.
Go ahead, Rachel.
Thank you, Phoebe.
What struck me most
so ahead of its time.
If you're talking about feminism,
I think you're right.
Well, feminism, yes.
But also the robots.
Since that video camera thing
just a little preview.
You're naked!
I know!
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Why?
On account of my rage.
Which, if I may say,
right now is out of control.
He gave me a pill for it.
A pill?
When the psychiatrist told me
to take a leave of absence...
...because I yelled at my boss,
time off work?
And you're okay with that?
I don't know.
It's going to be weird
not having a job for a while.
But I definitely don't care
about my sandwich.
I hate it when they make me see
like you better if you like yourself better."
Who needs that?
-You do.
-I know.
It's so embarrassing! I can't believe
you let me go on like that!
I'm sorry.
It was so funny when you compared
You weren't taking the class seriously.
Come on!
What is the big deal?
I thought it'd be something
we could do together.
I thought it would be fun.
Fun is good.
But I also wanted to learn.
People talk about what they learned
I just wanted to have fun.
You know who should go?
I know! I know! I know!
Monica, you asked the question.
Oh, my God, that's Monica!
You get away from me,
you sick, sick, sicko!
What's going on?
Joey has got a secret peephole!
-Oh, no!
-Yes, he has a naked picture of Monica!
He takes naked pictures of us, then
to explain why he's such a big pervert!
I am not a pervert, okay?
It's just....
I just kind of....
I think I can explain this.
Thank you.
Joey's a sex addict.
What?! No, I'm not!
It's okay! It's good!
It's a disease.
I am not a sex addict!
Yes, you are!
That's the only way
to explain all this stuff!
No, it isn't. It's not.
Because you could also explain it
with the truth!
What is the truth?
-What's up?
thinks of that.
You slept with my sister?
Yes, but it was
We just did it once, in London.
This is not good for my rage.
Is this true?
Of course, it's true.
How else would you explain all the
weird stuff that's been going on?
Yes, it's true.
If it happened once, how come we
found your underwear in our apartment?
That was the underwear
just a sex addict?
If anyone's a sex addict here,
it's Monica.
She has been trying to get me back
in the sack ever since London!
That's why she gave you
to try and entice Joey.
But, sadly, I could not be enticed.
Monica, this has to stop now.
I know, I know.
I know. I will, and I would appreciate
if we all could just...
...drop it immediately, and forever.
Okay. That is, if you can resist me.
-I'll give it my best shot.
-Good luck.
Unbelievable!
You really kept Joey's underwear?
Why? Why would you do that?
I'm Monica.
I'm disgusting.
I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
I think we've all learned
to my bucket.
I'm only eating the skin,
so the chicken's up for grabs.
You were making a good point.
I mean, till you got cut off.
What's up with that girl Monica?
I don't know.
I didn't come with her.
Hey, everybody!
to give us a test.
Test?
Come on!
Tests make us all better learners!
Oh, yeah!
We should have essay questions!
-What are you doing?
meats and dairy.
Middle shelf, fruits and vegetables.
And top shelf, expired products.
Why are you doing this?
Because I'm bored out of my mind.
I've already been to the bank,
post office and dry cleaners.
Dude, you just described
seven days' worth of stuff.
Spread it out a little.
I'm on sabbatical.
Hey, don't get religious
on me, okay?
A guy in your position needs to be
better at relaxing.
That's why we have comfortable chairs.
-Oh, no, no.
We're not gonna just sit.
Watch.
-Hello, Chandler Bing.
-Hello, Mr. Bing.
I love you.
All right, whoever this is,
It's not funny!
I can see you, Mr. Bing.
You look sexy in your new suit.
Leave me alone!
For the love of God, leave me alone!
And that's Wednesday.
The One with
The lnappropriate Sister
Hey, you guys! Guess what?
The British are coming?
Oh, you and your ways.
Since it's Christmas,
and later on I get my bucket.
I'll be spreading joy
to the people.
Last year I spread a little joy,
but not enough.
So this year I'm doing the whole city.
I knew a girl in high school who
a lot like Chandler lately.
That is so not true.
So, Phoebe, where are you
doing your bell-ringing?
They gave me a great spot
right by Macy's.
They never give a good spot
"Merry Christmas" in  languages.
I lied!
Oh, my God. Here's Danny.
Just watch this.
See? Still pretending
he's not interested.
He's coming over.
Pretend we've forgotten who he is.
-Hey, guys.
She's not bad to look at, right?
Thanks, Mon.
Of course.
Do you want to go out
on a date with her?
Absolutely. Is Friday okay?
Friday is perfect.
She can't wait.
On the date, I'll be able
You know what? Don't answer me.
I have a date with Danny!
All right, it's ,
I guess my lunch break is over.
-What are you guys gonna do?
-lf you're going back to work...
...I'll probably just hang out.
ltalian actor from Queens!
Well, Talia Shire
suddenly became available.
She's a woman!
What can I say? She nailed it!
Is there anything else?
You'll just say no again, but...
...gay porn?
Happy holidays!
Feliz Navidad!
Allo and Merry Christmas!
Oh, thank you, sir!
Here's some joy.
-How's it going?
It looks really expensive.
Yeah. I guess.
Just get your nails done?
Yes, Phoebe, but this
is all I have, okay?
Thanks. Happy holidays!
Here's your joy.
Thank you! Happy holidays and
-I'm making change for the bus.
Can't you leave the
dollar for the poor?
I'm poor.
I gotta take the bus.
Okay, season's greetings and everything,
something besides joy. Just
I can't believe
I didn't get that part.
I'm sorry, man.
What you should do...
...is make something happen
for yourself.
You know, like write a play.
Or a movie. What about those
If I did write something...
...what are the chances I could
get those guys to star in it?
Wait a second.
I could star in it!
Or that.
I can't write.
that it takes. I can't do it.
I'll help you.
Yeah. I'll make up a schedule
and make sure you stick to it.
Plus, it'll give me something to do.
You'd do that for me?
Thanks.
We'll start slow. All you have
of your main character.
-Done.
-And it can't be Joey.
-It's not.
-Or Joseph.
What's up?
I just saw Danny on the subway
around her.
Honey, I'm sorry.
You should be.
This is all your fault.
You meddled in our relationship!
You had no relationship!
But I was doing my thing
and everything...
...was going according to the plan!
Oh, God, stop with the plan!
So what if you saw him
so charming he'll forget all about...
...that stupid subway girl.
She was kind of stupid.
You're right.
I'm just going to go on the date.
I'm just going to go on the date.
That is the new plan.
Hurry!
-How do you spell "suspicious"?
to be suspicious about stuff.
Chandler Bing, seven!
Chandler Bing, zero!
You're driving me crazy with that.
-I'll stop.
-Don't stop.
Move the bowl further away.
at a man's game now.
-Want to play?
-I can't play games.
Ross'll be home soon. I have to write
five pages to stick to his schedule.
So play for  minutes,
is a little lighter fluid.
But be careful.
I want our security deposit back.
We said goodbye to that
when we invented hammer darts.
Do you even remember which part
You can't
Stop that young lady!
She donated trash!
The charity's on fire!
Help!
Thank you. I need that!
What is this?
It's : in the morning!
All right. "A room.
A man enters. He looks suspicious."
That's it?
You're supposed to
"The Official Rulebook of Fireball."
That's the game we played.
It's great. You take a
tennis ball, a bowl and lighter
This is helping your career?
You wanted to be an actor.
Not the creator of
I'll get back to work.
Shame on you! You should know better!
Joey needs to work.
Now come on.
You can have this back
when the five pages are done.
-I had a nice time tonight.
but my sister's visiting.
-I think she's asleep on the couch.
-Your sister?
Your sister's asleep on the couch?
I saw you with her on the subway
and now she's asleep on the couch!
-I thought I heard you.
I'd have fixed myself up.
-Like it would help.
-You are so bad.
-You are.
-You are.
-You are.
Come here!
It's very nice to meet you.
Nobody!
Nobody respects the bucket!
You wouldn't believe
what people put in here!
Does this look like a
-Yeah, but I won't take any more crap.
No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.
Good. You're tough.
You lived on the street.
I'll go back to being
Street Phoebe.
But not totally back. Street Phoebe
but did you guys wrestle?
-Oh, yeah.
-All the time.
In fact, I was undefeated.
Well, you weighed  pounds.
Still, I was quick as a cat.
I met Danny's sister yesterday.
-That was the girl on the subway.
-You're kidding.
They were very, you know...
...wrestle-y.
But I guess that's normal?
We don't wrestle now.
Not since I got too
You wanna go?
Oh, fine.
Ready?
Wrestle!
Okay, you know what?
Actually, that helps a lot.
Thanks.
Let's go!
The puck drops in  minutes!
Joey's not going.
I didn't finish my five pages.
Finish them tomorrow.
Tomorrow he's redoing
did not reflect my best work.
Cut him some slack. If he relaxes,
he'll get some work done.
I think he's been relaxing enough,
thanks to you...
...and Fireball.
If you think Fireball's relaxing,
because you're bored.
It's not his fault
you're unemployed.
I am not unemployed.
I'm on sabbatical!
Guys, don't fight.
And I'm doing this because
you'd be doing the same.
So being a friend means
being a jerk?
If it does, then you're
an amazing friend of mine.
Let's settle this
-Let's settle this right now.
There. Now no one's going
to the game.
-I paid for those!
-You said you would, but you didn't.
Oh, yeah.
We finally get
forgets the camera.
The same thing
happened to me one time.
When did that happen to you?
Remember? We were jogging
and saw that bird.
I wanted to take a picture,
guy is not jogging.
Oh, this is so good.
You have got to try it.
-Damn. I got it on my pants.
-Here, I'll get it.
We better take them off
-Oh, great.
Okay, bye. Oh, my God!
-That was unbelievable.
-See? I told you.
Yeah. Sorry.
I don't believe they're
brother and sister.
They're brother and sister?!
I guess you'll have to cancel your date.
And call their mother.
Wait a minute. Open your hand.
Not interested in that.
What's this?
A Canadian coin?
Get out of here!
No drinks near the bucket.
Set it down there and then
you can make a contribution.
You can leave the "hurt bunny"
to get out of here!
Phoebe, we've been
getting complaints.
We're moving you to a
less high-profile spot.
-Ginger's taking this corner.
or we remove you.
Fine.
I'll give you one pointer.
Look out for that bitch.
-I thought we said .
-You know what? Let's skip it.
What? Why?
You and your sister seem to have
That "special bond" again.
Why do women have a problem
with my being close to my sister?
-I don't know, but
-Do you have brothers?
No, I have two sisters. But one
-No. They're not very nice people.
I like you.
I think this could go somewhere.
So I'm close to my family.
Don't let it stand in our way.
Well, I don't know....
When you put it that way
Danny? Hurry up.
playing in the street.
Want to go give them a project,
ruin their day?
If they have a ball,
you could stick razors in it...
...and teach them a new game:
I already finished my five pages.
Now we can go
to the Ranger game last night!
No, dude.
Ross tore up the tickets.
I guess without so many distractions
down your neck all the livelong day!
The important thing is, I finished it.
And I think it's really good.
But it would help if I could hear it.
Would you guys read it for me?
-Yeah, all right.
I was really wrong. I am sorry."
"No, it was me. I'm sorry.
I overreacted."
"Maybe it was both of us.
But we had our best friend's inter
But we had our best friend's
-I'm sorry too.
Keep reading.
The good part's coming up.
"l am sorry, Chandler."
"l am sorry, Ross."
"A handsome man enters."
"l don't know what you're talking
about, but I'd like to thank you both.
You. You wouldn't let me

It's a typical New York apartment.
Two girls are just hanging out. Go.
-"Hi, how are you doing, Kelly?"
-"I'm doing just fine.
God, Tiffany, you smell so great."
"It's my new perfume.
Why don't you come closer where
-This is disgusting.
I'm not reading this.
Wait, wait, wait!
The handsome man was about to enter!
Any entertainment there?
All right. Here we go!
, the year of Joey.
We're very happy for you.
What's the matter?
We wanted to kiss at midnight,
what are you gonna do?
Will you just trust me?
Thirty-three, , 
Who are you kissing at midnight?
Rachel or Phoebe?
You can't kiss your sister.
-Who's gonna kiss my sister?
-Chandler.
Oh, man! Really?
Would you rather
with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Phoebe! Listen.
Ross wants to kiss you at midnight.
So obvious.
Why doesn't he just ask?
-Rach! I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
You got the history.
So?
-Would you prefer me or Chandler?
-Good point.
Three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.
All the Resolutions
You know what?
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say "No divorces in '!"
But your divorce isn't final yet.
Just the one divorce in '!
I am gonna be happy this year.
I am gonna make myself happy.
Do you want us to leave the room?
Every day I am gonna do one thing
a planeload of people...
...whose resolution is
to plummet to their deaths.
Maybe your resolution should be
not to make fun of your friends.
Especially the ones who might
of flying up your nose...
...than you do of
not making fun of us.
I'll bet $ you can't go the year
without making fun of us.
Better yet, a week.
I'll take that bet, my friend.
Paying me the $ can be...
...the "new thing you do" that day.
And it starts right now!
My New Year's resolution is
I have listed on my resume?
I would love it
if one of those was true.
Want me to teach you?
I'm great.
Really?
Yeah, thanks, Phoebe.
My resolution is to be less obsessed
with being neat and clean.
Really?
Or something else.
Look. Blaire forgot her glasses.
She'll need these to keep an eye
on that boyfriend.
Who, from what I hear,
if you know what I mean!
Maybe your resolution
should be to gossip less.
What? I don't gossip.
Maybe sometimes I find out things.
Or I hear something
and I pass that information on.
You know, kind of
Is Ted Koppel a gossip?
If Ted Koppel talked about his
coworkers' botched boob jobs, I would.
They were like this!
Fine, my New Year's resolution
will be not to gossip.
-It's easy.
-Okay, let's see how you did last year.
No. No. Not my diary.
You cannot read my diary.
My resolution is to write in you every day.
See you tomorrow."
Nothing.
You know, not a lot happened last year.
All right, I will prove to you that I can keep it
said a lot of mean stuff about me...
...and I set her bike on fire.
-Wow, what did she say about you?
-She said I was crazy.
But I guess she got hers.
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.
I just asked that girl out.
Nice!
Is that part of
I've heard it somewhere before.
Oh, really? Where?
Somewhere funny, I'll bet.
Guess what.
I have a date
with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Oh, this must be killing you!
All right, see you later.
Not really.
-I haven't told you her middle name yet.
-Well, don't. Just don't.
-See you later.
I am ready for my first lesson.
No, you don't touch the guitar.
First you learn here, then here.
Lesson one Chords.
Now, I don't know
the actual names of the chords.
But I made up names for the way
my hand looks while I'm doing them.
So then this is "Bear Claw."
"Turkey Leg"...
...and "Old Lady."
What an interesting approach
I myself find it regular.
Hey, everybody!
Rachel was so good today.
She didn't gossip at all.
I didn't.
Even when I found out
Let's say I found out
so I stopped by this guitar store
Did you touch
any of the guitars there?
Did you?
No.
Give me your hands.
Strings.
Pick.
-Do you want to learn to play guitar?
-Yes.
Then don't touch one!
-Hi, Ben.
Ross is wearing leather pants?
Someone comment on the pants!
-I think they're very nice.
-I really like them a lot.
Not what I had in mind.
People like Ross don't wear
these types of pants.
You see, they're very tight.
Maybe there's something in that area?
I think they look really good.
Where'd you get them?
I needed a new thing for today.
There's this leather store
"Wow. I've never owned...
...a really good-smelling
pair of pants before."
Oh, come on!
What do you think?
You look like a freak.
Awful!
What are you doing?
-It's my New Year's resolution.
-To blind my child?
To take pictures of us together.
It's the best resolution.
I'm burning up.
Oh God! She wants to snuggle now?
Is she trying to kill me?
It's like a volcano in here!
-Are you hot?
-No.
It must just be me, then.
That was just the pants
-Thanks.
My favorite part's coming up!
Oh, my God!
Tiger.
Dragon.
Iceberg!
Joseph, did you even study
at all last night?
Yes, I did!
Then do lceberg.
G-sharp.
G-sharp?
Have you been studying
the real names of the chords?
Have you?
Oh, my God!
What? I didn't touch a guitar!
But you're questioning my method!
No, I'm not questioning it.
to try a little harder!
Maybe I need to try a real teacher!
Here! Andy Cooper.
He teaches guitar.
There's a picture of him with a kid.
And the kid's got a guitar!
Fine!
You learn from
your "qualified instructor."
But don't come crying
"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"!
Oh, fine. Take his side!
I can't wait to be with you.
I'll sneak over as soon as I can.
I'll tell Rachel
I'll be doing laundry.
Laundry.
Is that my new nickname?
You know what your nickname is,
Phoebe was a terrible teacher.
I wasn't learning anything from her
Look I feel bad, too
Forget it, we're going around in circles.
Joey, it's Ross.
I need some help.
Chandler's not here.
You can help me.
I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.
Nice!
No, I got really hot in my pants,
from the sweat.
Or my legs expanded from the heat.
I can't get them back on, Joey.
I can't!
That is quite a situation.
Do you see any powder?
Powder! Yeah, I have powder.
Good, good.
Sprinkle some on.
It'll absorb moisture.
Then you can get your pants on.
Yeah, hold on.
They're not coming on, man.
Okay, cut slits in the pants, right?
and tell her you're the lncredible Hulk.
Chandler's not there?
That would have worked,
but all right, fine.
You see any....
Oh, Vaseline?
I see lotion. I have lotion.
have made a paste.
Really.
What color is it?
What difference does that make?
If the paste matches the pants,
you can make paste pants...
...and she won't know!
Do you have a minute?
Dude, what am l
Rachel's here, so good luck.
Let me know how it goes.
Joey, I have such a problem.
Your timing couldn't be better.
I'm putting out fires
You cannot tell anyone.
No, no, no!
I don't want to know.
You do want to know.
This is unbelievable!
I'm tired of being the guy
So I pick up the phone
I'm not listening to you!
You've been in there for a long time.
I'm starting to get
kind of freaked out.
All right, I'm coming out.
Hey, can you turn the lights off?
Let's just leave the lights on.
Oh, my God!
I had a problem.
I can't talk to you. I don't have
a fancy ad in the yellow pages.
I want to apologize for saying
to be my teacher again?
I promise, I won't touch a guitar
until you say I'm ready.
You really think I'm ready?
Wow, cool!
-Was the chord at least right before
-No.
Oh, my God!
We heard about your pants.
and I'm a loser...
...with stupid leather pants
that don't even fit!
You're not a loser.
Look at me!
Hey, look!
Ben drew a picture of you.
You're a cowboy.
Because of the leather pants?
He thinks you're a cowboy,
not a loser. That's something.
-lt really is something.
You know strange things.
What is the boiling point of brain?
I used to know this.
I'm gonna go kiss Ben good night.
I can't believe he thinks
I'm a cowboy.
I would make a good cowboy.
Now that everything's wrapped up,
I'll do my laundry.
Yeah, me too.
long enough...
...someone's bound to leave
a plane unattended.
-Good luck, honey.
-Bye.
Remember that thing
But if you found out on your own...
...that would be okay
and we could talk about it.
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret.
So that would be okay.
Would you mind going
he borrowed from me?
Now? You want me
to go over there now?
-Do you know something?
-Do you?
-I might know something.
-You tell me first.
-I can't.
-Then I can't.
Okay, fine.
You don't know.
I'll walk into his bedroom
and see the thing...
...I think I know is actually
-And you know!
Yeah, I know!
Chandler and Monica?
Oh, this is unbelievable!
-How long have you known?
-Too long!
I've been dying to talk
They're so weird about that.
It's raining.
I don't like to fly in the rain.
I am gonna go for a walk
in the rain.
Me too.
That's weird.
I bet they're doing it.
Okay, look.
I can't take it anymore.
So you win. Okay?
Make it a spaceship...
...so you can get back
to your home planet!
Phone call for you. Tom Jones.
He wants his pants back!
And Hornswoggle? What, are you dating
last night.
It's not that big a deal.
So they're doing it.
I cannot believe you would say that!
Sorry. Monica and Chandler
are "making love."
No, I mean, come on.
Who initiated the first kiss?
I don't know.
God, I just can't imagine Chandler
being romantic.
Is he romantic with her?
I don't know.
Are they in love?
I don't know.
You don't know anything.
I know one thing.
They did it right there.
The One With Chandler's Work Laugh
Could I have a scone?
-Want to hear some good news?
-ls somebody else gonna give it to us?
Because you certainly don't seem like
Someone I know is getting married.
Weddings are happy occasions.
Oh, it's my ex-wife, Emily!
Sorry, man.
-Here's your scone.
-Thanks.
Stupid British snack food!
Did they teach you that
help you deal with it?
You two are in the past.
You can't be mad about the past.
Are you still mad about, you know,
the Louisiana Purchase?
Nobody's mad about that.
Exactly!
What are we celebrating?
We had a lot of liquor
left over from Christmas.
Our friends aren't here. We can be
a real couple. We don't have to hide.
I know. I can do this.
And I can do this.
We can't do that.
Hey, Bing!
Who's the pretty lady,
that very question, sir.
My boss, Doug.
-This is Monica.
-Hi.
-This is my wife, Kara.
-Nice to meet you.
Did you hear about the new law firm
come up with one too.
All right. Check me out.
He says, "$, Father.
Same as in town."
Everybody at work loved you last night.
And they like me more
just because I was with you.
You repaired the damage
He never talks to me outside of work.
Except for that time
at that strip club.
Strip church.
-I'll go find a racket.
-I thought you had one.
I used to, but then Joey thought
I've never gotten it back.
Good luck with that.
What's up?
Why are you here?
I thought you had inventory.
I do, but I decided I'd take
a long lunch...
...and spend some time
we don't talk anymore.
How are you?
What is new with you?
Not much. Work's good.
We don't have to talk about work.
Talk about anything.
You know what?
Let's talk about relationships.
What's going on?
Nothing.
You go.
There was this guy at the bank
that I thought was cute.
But I don't anymore.
That's juicy.
You know what? I actually do
not anything else?
I'm sure. Is there something
you want to talk to me about?
No!
If there was, I wouldn't tell you.
Then what happened?
You'll get your turn.
-Hey, Phoebe. What's going on?
-Nothing.
This is not over.
No, no, no!
I was up all night writing
and now it's all covered in....
Actually, thanks!
All right!
Ready to go to the movies?
Actually, I think I'll skip it.
Really?
I'll read my book.
I just want to be alone right now.
Sure you don't want to?
Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan.
of yours is a real tiger.
Are you all right?
We'll just get
a little sip of water.
Am I on fire today or what?
Those birds are browned,
basted and ready to be carved.
Okay, easy, Martina.
I think we should let them
what you just said.
Let them win one.
Are you crazy? We own those two.
Look at them!
He can't even breathe,
and she's popping pills.
You're not giving them a chance.
They have rackets.
We'll make this the last game.
Yes, sir. Put me out of my misery.
Are you sure you never played pro?
Please let them win.
I'll take it down to %,
-I got it!
Nice shot.
I got it!
Long!
I can't believe you let them win.
Well, at least you hid
your feelings well about it.
I was frustrated.
It's my racket.
Frustrated with you!
If we hadn't lost, they would never have
invited us to dinner tomorrow.
What bothers me...
...is how different
the fake laugh...
...the "See you later, Bing!"
"Not if I see you first, Doug!"
Listen, I don't sound
like some crazed, drunken pirate.
I know you don't,
The guy's a suck-up.
Because you said that...
...I'm not putting out tonight!
Something's wrong.
My brother doesn't stay out all night.
Maybe we should check
the trash chute.
Ross couldn't fit
how I got stuck there.
Oh, my God!
Where the hell have you been?
Just, you know, out.
Oh, out! God, I don't know
why we didn't think to check there.
What were you doing?
I went to a bar, and then...
...I just walked around for a while.
You walked around all night
in the city by yourself?
He hooked up!
He hooked up.
I don't have to answer your questions.
but Chandler is in Yemen.
I'm a young woman. I have needs.
I can't wait forever.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
So I'm asking you, please,
just take a moment before you judge me.
Nobody's judging you.
Mr. Right-place-at-the-right-time...
...call me.
So I guess you finished your book.
Had some time on our hands, did we?
I know what you guys are going to say.
You two would have
He obviously went crazy.
He obviously lost his mind.
Look, it's not that crazy. Okay?
But it's Janice! I mean, she's...
...Janice!
How drunk were you?
Janice and I have a lot in common.
We've both been divorced.
We both have kids.
Are you going to see her again?
-Don't put ideas in his head!
-I will see her.
Damn it, Phoebe!
I have to tell you something
even though I knew you liked him.
That feels so good to get off my chest.
Okay, you go.
My turn? What are you talking about?
I know about you and Chandler.
I overheard you
on the phone the other day.
You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doing
Is that my new nickname?"
And you said
"You know what
your nickname is, Mr. Big."
You're writing yourself
a little play there, Rach.
Let me know how it turns out.
I wouldn't know, because I got
call him Mister...
...Bigot.
Mr. Bigot.
He tells the most racist jokes.
All right. So that's it.
There's nothing going on
between you and Chandler?
Me and Chandler?
Put your $ down.
First one to find
the tasty treat wins, okay?
All right, let's get the contestants
Judge?
Judge rules, no violation.
It's so weird to say this,
but I just had a great date with Janice.
-What?
-Are you serious?
I opened up to her about all
such focused attention.
You don't need Janice for that.
You've got us.
The duck gets the Nutter Butter!
That's not a Nutter Butter.
That's an old won ton!
Judge rules...
...Nutter Butter.
Tough call.
Seriously, I strongly believe that
-A little sugar.
I'll have Monica stick her finger in it.
That will sweeten it up.
-That laugh doesn't give you a headache?
-You get used to it.
I don't think that I can.
This will be it for me
What's the big deal?
I'd rather not be with
this work-weasel guy...
...when I can be with my boyfriend,
who I actually respect.
I got to apologize for Kara's coffee.
to defend itself.
Hear what I said?
What?
It's a joke.
What's the matter with you?
Well, I just didn't think
it was funny, sir.
Excuse me?
-Well, I just
you understood the joke.
Really?
I mean, it was really funny.
I just don't think that you got it.
You see, Kara's coffee
is weak-tasting.
But what Doug did was imply
-I think I do!
-Thank you, Monica.
-I thought you could use the help.
Coffee in a fight!
You mind if I read
my comic books in here?
Sure. Why?
Chandler and Monica are over there.
she was going to be working late.
She keeps lying to me.
That's it! I'm going over there
and confronting them right now.
Panty raid.
All right, so you're telling me
that I have to tell racist jokes now?
I'm just not very good at this.
I'm a terrible liar.
-I know.
Ever since high school, Rachel was the
one person that I told everything to.
I miss that so much now.
She's my best friend.
Oh, my God, Rachel!
What are you doing here?
Well, I actually came over here
to borrow this lamp...
...to look at my books.
You know, see them a little better.
Okay, great.
Well, what I was doing
some extra pocket money.
When I said to you earlier
that I was at work...
...I'm at my new work.
Good enough. Right?
I'll go look at my books.
Go get back to my new job.
Congratulations on your new job!
Man, she is really gullible.
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
-Actually, I should get going.
sabbatical from work
Yes, yes. You did.
-Oh, man!
-What is wrong now?
This isn't what I ordered.
Man! Can't anything
go right in my life?
First, my marriage falls apart,
you lose your job...
...your ex-wife gets married so fast!
And now the coffee!
We need to talk.
-Sometimes I feel
-No, no, don't.
I'm going to talk.
I believe...
...that the sun has set...
...on our day in the sun.
You're a very sweet person, Ross.
Unfortunately...
...I just don't think I can take
I'm hearing this right.
You're ending this with me because...
...I'm too whiny?
So you're saying...
...I've become so whiny...
...that l...
...annoy you...
...Janice.
Well, yeah!
Oh, my God!
Will you be okay?
I am now.
I guess that's two out of three...
...Joey!
Dude, we got to talk.
I wanted to tell you something before
you heard it from someone else.
I hope this isn't too weird, but...
...I had a thing with Janice.
You're not mad?
Why would I be mad?
Because there's certain rules
about this kind of stuff.
You don't fool around with
or girls they're related to.
I am mad.
But you know,
I'm going to forgive you.
Because that's what friends do.
They forgive their friends when
they do everything you just said.
Thank you.
But I want you to remember...
...that I forgave you.
I also want you to remember
that I gave you...
...twenty-seven dollars.
No strings attached!
If you can't remember that...
...we should write it down.
Let's write it down!
I can't believe we've never
done this. It's so good!
It's so good for Monica.
Time's up! My turn.
-That was half an hour?
but I give the best massages.
All right, then massage me up
right nice!
It's so good, isn't it?
I don't know what
I did to deserve it.
Now stop trying to add more time
for information.
I wanted to give it up.
I just didn't know what it was!
If it hurts that bad,
you should tell her.
For the first time,
by telling the truth.
Dude, look out!
You almost crushed my hat.
Sorry.
And the bunny got away.
This would be the place
where you explain the hat.
This is called a top hat.
And why are you wearing this?
Is it "top hat"?
There's this play...
...and I'm up for the part of this
wear ultra-hip, high-fashion stuff.
And you'll make them disappear?
Like you could find something
this sophisticated.
Done!
If you want to look good,
come to the store. I'll help you.
-Thanks!
got back from the hospital.
Are you all right?
I'm fine,
but my grandma sort of died.
Phoebe, sorry.
It's okay.
She had a really incredible life.
It's not like I won't see her again.
She'll visit.
Maybe she's with us right now.
Right. She's on a new spiritual plain
in a car right outside!
Phoebe' grandmother just died.
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
Actually, it's kind of cool.
Because it's like...
...you know, one life ends
and another begins.
Not the way they're doing it.
What happened?
and never came back up again.
I'm so sorry.
The last thing she said was
"You get the eggs, I'll get the yogurt,
and we'll meet at the checkout counter."
You know what?
We will meet at the checkout counter.
Since you're returning
all this stuff...
...you'll have to wear underwear.
All right.
It's a shoulder bag.
It looks like a woman's purse.
Trust me, all the men are carrying
them in the spring catalog.
See, look.
Men carrying the bag.
See, look.
looks so good on me, a man.
Exactly. Unisex!
Maybe you need sex.
I had sex a couple days ago.
No, Joey. U-N-I sex.
I ain't gonna say no to that!
-Who is it?
-It's Phoebe.
Oh, great!
Oh, you.
What's up?
Well, I sort of have some bad news.
a memorial service tomorrow.
Okay, I know I went to that already.
No, you didn't!
Then who's been dead?
Lots of people!
Look, are you coming or not?
I thought she was dead,
so I've made my peace.
Plus I'm going to a concert.
I'd invite you,
but I only have two tickets left.
-Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
Mrs. Tribbiani.
What? Are you referring
to my man's bag?
I thought it just looked good,
but it's practical too.
It's got compartments for your
The audition's tomorrow.
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
You get mustard on that bag,
you can't return it.
Why would I return this?
I love this bag!
-All right, then you owe me $.
from the job I'll get. Thanks to you.
What's the part? Auntie Mame?
Don't listen to them.
I think it's sexy.
You-and-I sexy?
Hello, Mrs. Pinilla.
Thank you for coming.
Here's your -D glasses.
Reverend Pong will say
-Fine.
Hey, Phoebe. I'm so sorry.
You know what?
My grandma had the exact same bag!
I brought you flowers.
Oh, thanks!
Pulling flowers out
makes the bag look masculine.
Excuse me, is this the memorial?
Welcome.
Here's your -D glasses.
All right.
So how did you know Frances?
Actually, I hadn't seen her for years.
But I was pretty tight
My name, actually, is Joe.
Joe Hill.
You're Frank Buf
No! Joe Hill.
You just said
I got to go.
Thank you so much for coming.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
That was my dad.
Check it out!
It's like it's coming right at me.
-Did you catch him?
-What did he say?
He said, "Nice to meet you, Glenda."
I couldn't give him my real name.
Why not?
You saw the way he ran.
You think he'd talk
and I needed to talk to him.
I'm going to meet him
at the coffeehouse.
Could everyone take their seats?
I just can't think about that now.
I want to say goodbye to my grandma.
Let's go say goodbye.
I'm off to my audition.
How do I look?
Great!
This is a great bag.
And it's as handy as it is becoming.
Just because you don't understand
something, doesn't make it wrong.
You guys have to get used
to the fact that Joey...
...comes with a bag!
I've got to meet my dad.
Will you tell him who you are?
Not at first.
in some serious physical danger.
I'd walk in there,
I'd be like, "Yo, Dad!
You and me, outside.
Right now!"
I kind of scared myself.
Well, at least you scared someone.
You'd think I'd be angry.
You'd think I'd want to rip
Here, let me help you.
Get off!
Stop it!
Why are you doing that to me?
What are you talking about?
As a masseuse and a human...
...I'm begging you,
never do that to anyone!
I give good massages.
I gave them to Rachel
Watch.
He does not like it.
He's in pain!
-No, he's not.
-Yes, he is!
-What?
to lie to each other....
And by "we"...
...I mean society.
Anytime you're ready.
Well, you must be new here.
Maybe we get a table,
I buy you a drink.
Could you try it without the purse?
Yeah, sure.
Well, you must be new here.
Maybe we sit
Can I ask you something?
Sure. What?
Well, first,
it's a woman's bag, it's not.
It's a man's bag.
Okay. And go!
Let me show you the catalog.
Look. See?
It's the latest thing.
Everyone's got one.
Men, women, children.
Do you sell these?
No, these babies sell themselves.
Thank you.
That was great.
But I didn't read anything.
I think we've seen enough.
All right, I'll see you.
We got it. We got it.
Is Rachel here?
Listen, I just wanted to apologize
"l don't like your massages."
I don't like your massages.
See? It's no big deal.
But now you're crying!
I'm not crying about that.
I'm crying about something at work.
My boyfriend said
he didn't like my massages.
You don't have
You don't know me at all!
You give the worst massages
in the world.
I'm crying here!
Look, hear me out.
You give the best bad-massages.
If anybody was looking
for the best bad-massage...
...and they thought,
if there was an award...
...for the best bad-massage....
Who would get that?
It would be you!
You, Monica!
And you'd get all the votes.
So they could call the award,
Before we get started, I need you...
...to state for the record
that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.
Yes, I am.
What did Frances leave me?
That's why you wanted me to come.
Yes, she did. She left you...
...this lipstick.
It's used.
Cool!
I have just a few questions to ask,
so I'll get out my official forms.
So question one
You were married to Frances'
Did that marriage end
A Happily?
B Medium?
Or C In the total abandonment...
...of her and her two children?
It really says that?
Yeah, see?
I guess then I would have to say C.
Total abandonment.
Reasons for abandonment
A Top-secret government work.
B Amnesia.
Or C You're just a selfish,
irresponsible...
...bad, bad man.
I don't want the lipstick that much.
Would you do me a favor?
Would you give Lilly...
...that, please?
When you see Lilly,
give her that note.
I wanted to talk to her
the way you did, and I chickened out.
I wrote her a note.
Give it to her, please?
But you came to see Lilly?
Yeah. Why?
Lilly's dead.
She what?
She's dead.
Are you sure?
If she isn't, cremating her
was a big mistake.
I can't believe this.
Oh, my God.
How long ago?
 years ago.
What about the girls?
Well, Ursula is a waitress
and she lives in Soho.
And Phoebe...
...is on this couch.
Yep, lipstick and a daughter.
Big day for you!
Phoebe, l....
It's just, I don't know what to say.
I just can't believe that you're
here nor there.
Would it make you feel
better if I said...
...that I was very, very sorry I left?
It doesn't matter what you say.
It won't make a difference.
So you can just go.
Well, you know, in my defense,
-Yes, it is.
I burned the formula,
and I put your diapers on backwards.
I made up a song to sing to you,
but that made you cry even more.
You make up songs?
Well, no, just that one.
Joey, you were so ready for it.
I thought so too...
...but the casting people
had problems with me.
What kind of problem?
To tell you the truth...
...they had a problem with the bag!
You know what?
It was a stupid play anyway.
It's time to give up the bag.
I don't want to give up the bag.
I don't have to give it up.
as I think you are with it...
...I just don't know if the world
is ready for you and your bag.
I can't believe this!
Wait, I'm not saying
you shouldn't have a bag.
There are other bags
-What?
There's a whole series of pockets here
I didn't even know about, Rach. Look.
Ursula, I have the most amazing news.
I found our dad.
Phoebe.
Your sister.
And I found our dad.
John Glenn? John Glenn is not our dad.
No, I will not join you in the lawsuit
while we were growing up.
He's not our father.
What do you mean
that's for a jury to decide?
Guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy's
putting stuff in boxes.
I'd say our naked buddy is moving.
Ironically, most of the boxes
old squishy butt.
And we're done
with the chicken fried rice.
If he's moving, maybe I should
try to get his place!
It would be so cool
we have a can...
...and it's connected by a string.
Or we could do
the actual telephone thing.
He's got packing tape stuck
to where you really don't want it.
Get it off, fat man! Get it off!
Oh, no, he's trying to pull it off slowly.
Take it from me, if you're gonna pull tape
how great it is!
Because your eye goes
to the big naked man.
It's amazing!
Hurry up with an application,
or I'll beat you to it.
Well, I'm going to use
-I know!
-I know!
-You know?
Yes, I know it. Joey knows,
but Ross doesn't, so stop screaming!
What's going on?
-What?
that you'll get this apartment!
Looks really good.
Looks pretty good!
Get in here!
Come on!
You mean whenever
Monica and Chandler...
...were doing laundry
with Linda from camp?
Doing it, doing it, phone, doing it.
I can't believe it!
I think it's great. For him.
She could do better.
Hey, you guys.
Come here!
Phoebe found out
about Monica and Chandler.
You mean how they're friends
and nothing more?
Joey, she knows.
We saw them doing it
up against the window.
We saw them fornicating.
So they know you know,
and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but it doesn't matter
who knows what.
Now enough of us know
will finally be over.
Or, we could not tell them we know,
and have a little fun.
What do you mean?
If they say they are doing laundry,
we'll give them laundry to do.
I would enjoy that.
You know what would be even more fun?
-So we'll make it fun.
We'll do it like a barbershop quartet!
We know, we know, we know
No, I want to do Phoebe's thing.
I can't take
You don't have to do anything.
Just don't tell them we know.
I can't take anymore secrets.
I got your secrets, their secrets,
secrets of my own.
You don't have any secrets.
Well, you don't know about Hugsy,
as the roommate.
And I would use the strongest tool
at my disposal.
My sexuality.
Hello, children.
Watch. Learn.
And don't eat my cookie.
That jacket looks great on you.
-Really?
I can't tell this to.
And the one person I want to the most.
What's going on?
I just haven't been
with a guy in so long...
...and sometimes you're
looking for something...
...and it's right there
I know I will.
You are so cute.
How did you get to be so cute?
My grandfather was Swedish.
And my grandmother was
a tiny little bunny.
Now you're even cuter.
You know, that is a popular
opinion today, I must say.
The weirdest thing happened
always thought you were charming...
...in a sexless kind of way.
You know, I can't hear that enough.
I just think you misunderstood her.
I didn't, okay?
She was all over me.
She touched my bicep,
for crying out loud.
This bicep?
Well, it's not flexed right now.
Why is it so hard for you to believe
see a movie with us?
Actually, I was going
to do some laundry.
Want to do it with me?
Sure, I'll do it with you.
Okay, great.
Hold on a second.
Here you go.
That would really help me out a lot.
I don't have enough quarters.
I have quarters!
Great. Now we can do laundry all night.
All night laundry!
Hey, any word on the apartment yet?
I called there, and it turns out
Naked Guy is subletting it.
He's already had  applicants.
-Oh, man.
between them and me is?
Your history of bedwetting?
Hey, I trusted you, man!
Anyway, the difference is...
...I've got the edge.
It's not exactly ethical,
but I sent him a bribe...
...to tip the scales in my direction.
You can see it from the window.
Is it that pinball machine
with the big bow on it?
That new mountain bike?
What did you send?
A basket of mini muffins.
There's a whole table of them.
was going to get you the apartment?
Someone sent us a basket at work, and
people went crazy over those muffins.
It was the best day.
Your work makes me sad.
Oh, man, I want that place so much!
And I was so sure
that was going to work.
There's  bucks
to catch that movie.
Bye.
Bye, Chandler.
I miss you already.
Did you see that? The inappropriate,
and the pinching?
Actually, I did.
So do you believe
She knows about us!
Are you serious?
She knows, and she's trying
to freak us out!
That's the only explanation!
But what about my pinchable butt
and my bulging biceps?
She knows!
Phoebe knows about us.
I didn't tell them!
Them?
Who's "them"?
Phoebe and Joey.
And Rachel.
I would have told you,
and I can go back to knowing nothing!
Unless
Not "unless"!
This must end now!
They think they are so slick
messing with us.
But they don't know
Think how much fun it would be to tell.
We know, we know, we know
What?
Oh, that wasn't you.
Honey, you got to stop
torturing yourself.
Why don't you find another apartment?
I've already looked
at  apartments this month.
None of them even compares
to share it with an Armenian family.
Grandma really liked me.
But I want Ugly Naked apartment!
You know what?
You should find out his hobbies
and use that to bond with him.
Like if I wanted something from Joey...
...I would strike up a conversation
about sandwiches...
...or my underwear.
I'm listening.
That is a great idea!
And I know Ugly Naked Guy because
He had the trampoline.
He broke that.
-He had gravity boots.
-He broke those too.
So he likes to break stuff.
I've got to go pick up Ben.
But I will figure something out.
Didn't he used to have a cat?
I wouldn't bring that up.
that big butt coming.
Hold on a second,
she's right here.
It's Chandler.
Hello, you.
Phoebe, I've been thinking
about you all day.
You know that thing you said before?
I'll let you feel my bicep.
Or maybe more.
I'll have to get back to you on that.
He wants me to come over
and feel his bicep and more!
Are you kidding?
I cannot believe
he would do that to Mon
Joey? Do they know that we know?
They know you know.
I knew it!
I would say, "Thank God!
Trying to mess with us?
They don't know that we know
they know we know.
Joey, you can't say anything.
Couldn't if I wanted to.
Good evening, sir. I'm Ross Geller.
I'm one of the applicants.
I realize that the competition
that you're naked.
I applaud you.
Man, I wish I was naked.
I mean, this looks so great.
That is how God intended it.
Look. They're panicked!
They'll totally back down.
If he wants a date,
he's going to get a date.
I'm going to go in.
Be sexy.
Please.
I'd love to come by tonight.
Really?
Absolutely.
Say, around ?
I'm really looking forward to you
That's our friend!
It's Naked Ross!
Would you like another mini muffin?
Try the blueberry, they're delicious.
Showtime!
Rachel, get me perfume.
Joey, can you get me
a bottle of wine and glasses?
All right, thanks, but glasses that do not
have handles and that are glass.
And wine that is not olive oil.
Make her think you want to have
My team always wins.
At this?
Just go get some! Go!
Now, I'm going to try to listen
from right here.
Oh, wait.
Good idea.
Don't give away the farm.
Come on in.
I was going to.
I brought some wine.
Would you like some?
Sure.
So here we are.
Nervous?
Me? No. You?
I want this to happen.
So do l.
I'm going to put on some music.
Joey likes to scare the duck.
Maybe I'll dance for you.
You look good.
Thanks.
You know, when you say
sweater vest right off.
Why don't we move into the bedroom?
Really?
Do you not want to?
First I want to take off
all my clothes...
...and have you rub lotion on me.
That would be nice.
I'll go get the lotion.
It's way out of hand.
She wants me to put lotion on her!
-She's bluffing!
He went to get lotion.
It's Chandler. You can take him.
Come on. Don't you remember when
you made him cry using only your words?
Aren't you guys done yet?
I want to sit in my chair!
The sooner Phoebe breaks him, the sooner
it's over and out in the open.
I like that.
Show him your bra.
till she cracks!
Give me a second.
-Did you clean up in here?
-Of course!
You're going?
Not without you, lover.
So this is my bra.
It's very, very nice.
Well, come here.
I'm very happy we're going
to have all the sex.
You should be.
left for us to do but kiss.
Here it comes.
Our first kiss.
You win!
I can't have sex with you!
-And why not?
-I'm in love with Monica!
You're what?
Love her!
I love her!
I love her!
I love you, Monica.
I love you too, Chandler.
I thought you were doing it.
I didn't know you were in love!
Dude!
Hats off to Phoebe.
So that's it?
It's over.
Everybody knows!
Actually, Ross doesn't.
We'd appreciate it
if no one told him yet.
Well, here it is.
A new place for a new Ross.
I'll have you and the guys from work
back on your feet.
I am that, and the whole rage thing
is definitely behind me.
I wonder if it's time for you
to rejoin our museum team?
That would be great.
I am totally ready
in the window!
I saw what you're doing to my sister!
Get out here!
Listen, we had a good run.
What was it?
Four, five months?
That's more than most people
-I am going on the lam.
Come on, Chandler.
I can handle Ross.
Hold on!
Hey, Ross.
What's up, bro?
What the hell are you doing?
What's going on?
I think Ross knows
This is my sister!
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!
We're not just messing around.
I love her.
I'm in love with her.
I'm so sorry that you
I love him too.
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!
You guys want to probably
get some hugs in too. Big news!
We've actually known for a while.
What? You guys knew?
You all knew and
you didn't tell me?
We were worried about you. We didn't
these lovebirds get back to business.
I'm just talking here.
He's the one doing your sister.
The One With the Girl Who Hits Joey
You know what I just realized?
If you guys have kids
We're having kids?
I call godfather!
You can't just call godfather.
Shouldn't her brother be godfather?
Sure. If you cared enough
to call it first.
-You're a few steps ahead of us.
the greatest wedding gift.
I'll go in on that with you.
I couldn't decide.
Hey, Katie.
This is Katie.
You ready to go?
I'll run to the bathroom.
Where's lunch?
I was thinking Chinese food.
I love Chinese!
How did you know I love Chinese?
She is so cute.
You could fit her
in your pocket.
She could fit in that little pocket
and she's really nice, but...
But what?
She keeps punching me.
In the cute, little
sweet way she just did?
It's a lot harder than it looks.
She's hurting me.
I know what you need.
You need a bodyguard.
What is Ben doing after preschool?
Joey is having a problem.
really difficult for you, and
I'm sorry, am I hurting you?
I brought you some housewarming gifts.
Salt, so your life always has flavor.
Bread, so you never go hungry.
And a scented candle for the bathroom.
Because, well, you know.
Thanks. Thanks.
And thanks, I guess.
Welcome. I'm Steve Cera,
president of the tenants' committee.
Ross Geller.
about Howard.
He is the handyman
who's retiring next week.
Everyone who lives here is kicking in
$ as a kind of a thank you.
That's nice.
Want to give me a check?
Not now. You can
for  years.
Yes, but I've lived here
for  minutes.
Okay, I get it.
Wait! Look, I'm sorry, it's just
I've never even met Howard.
I mean, I don't know Howard.
Howard's the handyman.
Yes, but to me, he's just "man."
Okay. Fine. Whatever.
Welcome to the building.
Can you believe that guy?
I really like his glasses.
So then President Steve
with my $ bill.
You really should wipe it off
with something.
You know what?
I'll throw a party.
For everyone in the building.
And I'll sit them all down and
I'm just a guy...
...who stands up
for what he believes in.
A man with principles.
Sounds like a fun party.
If you want them to like you,
why don't you just pay the $?
The party will cost you more.
That doesn't matter!
It's my principles!
your neighbors liking you.
They'll like me once
they come to my awesome party.
I gotta get some nametags.
And that crazy party animal
will be your brother-in-law.
Very funny.
are probably already in Monica's head?
Why?
Well, because she loves you
and because you love her.
Yeah, so? What's
that supposed to mean?
Don't freak out! I'm telling you
he didn't want to have babies.
And she is a woman. And she's
almost . And, you know, it's Monica.
I don't see it that way.
I see two Monicas.
My friend who lives across
who I started to date.
Now, who is to say what she wants?
I'm right.
Am I right?
Oh, absolutely.
I'm completely different from Richard.
He's an eye doctor,
and I don't wear glasses.
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
That makes everything different.
It's not different, is it?
Not unless different
You're such a nut!
You know, bread-stick fangs
are always funny.
No, you make them funny.
You're the funny one!
Look, Katie.
I really do. I like you a lot.
But sometimes when you
playfully punch me like that...
...it feels like I'm being hit
with a very tiny but a very real bat!
Like I could hurt you.
Are you making fun of my size?
Don't make fun of me
stay like this forever?
Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Yeah, here, somewhere else.
You know, wherever.
Are you okay?
I'm cool.
Casual.
What are you doing?
Just hanging out. Having fun
with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Man, I knew it!
everybody was joking about marriage!
Well, you do want
all that stuff, right?
You know what I want?
Yes! You want babies!
You have baby fever!
I do not have baby fever!
You're obsessed
related to babies and marriage.
Why don't we turn the heat
down on this pressure cooker!
Have you lost your mind?
This isn't about me. This is about
you and your weird commitment crap!
I know you. I know the thoughts
with Rachel tonight instead of you?
And that the only baby here is you?
Did you know I can't even
look at you now?
I did not know that.
It'll be okay, right?
She won't leave me. This is fixable.
-Yeah, sure.
how to fix it and I do.
And then you think I'm cute again.
I'm really tired of being
your relationship tutor.
Figure this out for yourself.
If you're afraid
of a real relationship...
...then don't be in one.
Howard! Howard! Howard!
Hi, Ross!
What are you doing here?
I thought this was your party,
And thanks for chipping in.
Oh, sure.
You chipped in?
Yeah, $.
I can't believe you gave him money.
I thought you agreed it was unreasonable
that they asked me for that money.
But they didn't ask me.
I'm just the exotic, generous stranger.
That's always fun to be.
But you're making me look bad.
No, I'm not! If anything,
talking to me. I'm a hit.
Hey, Phoebe!
Hey, Ross.
Maybe you two could
switch apartments.
Because Phoebe is more
our kind of people.
Think about it.
Okay, my bad.
You look big.
Thanks, I've been working out.
Listen, is it obvious
so I put on some extra padding.
If she hits me when she is happy,
can you imagine how hard she'll hit...
...when I take away the Joey love?
Oh, right. I forgot that you call it that.
Hey, cute jacket.
Thanks.
-That's so sweet!
-Ouch!
Did Joey tell you to say that?
I gotta tell you...
...I think you're the one
that is too much.
Joey has the nicest friends.
And the nicest girlfriend.
You're so sweet!
You're so sweet!
She just kicked me.
Aren't you going to do something?
Do something or I'll walk
out that door right now.
Are you going to?
This is a disaster.
Get something to eat.
What did you tell them about me?
I told them about you and Emily.
Trying to get some sympathy.
But you came off as the bad guy.
I told it wrong.
We should talk about that because
I don't understand what happened there.
This cake is really good!
Things are looking up.
Oh, my God!
You ruined everyone's fun.
Isn't it time you went home?
Go back to B, B.
Everyone, calm down!
I have something that I'd like to say.
Who here likes Ross?
Of course you don't like him.
He didn't give you any money.
He raised his own hand
when I asked, "Who likes Ross?"
And he's wearing two nametags.
I'll be honest. When I first met Ross,
I saw that he is really sweet...
...and caring and very generous.
All I'm saying is, don't judge
Ross before you get to know him.
You know, I like all of you guys now.
But when I first met you, you know?
Kurt? I thought, abrasive drunk.
Lola?
Mind-numbingly stupid.
You guys. Gold digger,
they would throw things.
I thought if I kept insulting them
you'd defend them.
Then you'd look like the hero.
See, I did not get that.
Where's Monica? I need
to talk to her, it's urgent.
I'm Monica.
I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
I've been thinking...
...about us. A lot of "us" thinking.
I guess there's
to get married is because you're sorry?
The best reason is pregnancy.
Sorry is fourth, behind being ready
and actually wanting to get married.
Will you be my wife?
I want you to take a minute and think
about how ridiculous this sounds.
I'm kind of wishing
and get married!
I was really confused.
Then I talked to these guys.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?
She's right, you know?
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
You know when I said
that I want you...
...to deal with relationship stuff
if I had said yes?
I would've been happy because...
...I would spend the rest of
my life with the woman I love.
Or you would have seen
a Chandler-shaped hole in that door.
Will you pass that knife?
No, I will not.
You don't have to be mean about it.
You're right. I'm sorry.
because I didn't say hello to you.
Or ask them to move in with you.
But I'm not sure. Chandler?
How long is this going to go on?
I think the length of teasing...
...is directly related to how insane
you were. So a long time.
This is fun!
Remember that
Will you marry me?
That's not funny.
-What are you guys doing up?
-Finishing the crossword.
Do you know a six-letter
word for "red"?
Dark red.
Wrong, but there's a connect-the-dots
puzzles with you.
Me too.
Now let's finish this
and go to bed.
Only one left.
Three-letter word.
Not dog, but....
Cat.
You are so smart!
I love you.
I love you too.
The One with the Cop
We still need a tip.
All right. Hold on.
I got it.
Nickel.
-How much do we need?
This could take a while.
Wait, look it!
This is a police badge!
Cool. But why would a cop come
in here? They don't serve doughnuts.
Could you discover the badge again?
I can do better than that.
I bet somebody's
But at the police station...
...I'll check their  Most Wanted List.
My friend's been number  forever.
This could be her year!
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey, Joey.
Is that my sweatshirt?
Yes, it is. I'm sorry.
someone's sweatshirt...
...shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?
And I'm not him.
I'm sorry.
I'll give it back.
It's gonna be all
smelling like Monica.
Do I smell bad?
You smell like a meadow.
I'm sorry.
What's with him?
The last time Joey went to a meadow
It's a police badge.
What's that doing here?
I don't see any doughnuts.
Cops and doughnuts.
Come on.
If Chandler had said it
the right couch, one that says...
..."Kids welcome here,"
but that also says...
..."Come here to me."
What? You say that to kids?
The "Come here to me" is,
you know, for the ladies.
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch,
-Sure.
The delivery charge
is almost as much as the couch!
That's ridiculous.
He lives three blocks away.
I'll take it myself.
Let's go.
Are you kidding?
Come on. It's only three blocks.
It's not very heavy. Try it.
Oh, I can do it.
You two will really
enjoy that couch.
We're not together.
Something didn't quite add up there.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, you. Her.
I mean, she's very...
...you know.
And you're, like...
...you know?
Not that it's any of your business,
I'm carrying a heavy couch.
Then tell him quickly.
Fine. We went out.
Not only did we go out...
...we did it  times!
You kept count?
You are such a loser!
A loser you did it with  times!
Excuse me, ma'am. You can't put
your cigarette out on a tree.
Yeah, I can.
So don't ever do that again.
I won't. Till I have
my next cigarette.
Hold it!
N.Y.P.D. Freeze, punk!
That's right. You are so busted.
Book them.
-Who are you talking to?
-Save it, red!
Apologize to the tree or
or I am calling for backup.
Backup! Backup!
I'm sorry! Sorry!
Okay, cancel backup!
Cancel backup!
Didn't you say there was
an elevator in here?
Yes, I did, but there isn't.
the whole hiring movers thing?
No way. They're a rip-off.
They check out your stuff
and come back later and steal it.
It's true. I saw it on Dateline.
Jane Pauley is the one woman
I would kiss.
-There's just something about her.
I listened to your dumb story.
Okay, go left.
Left. Left.
Okay, you know what?
There's no more left left.
Lift it straight up over your head.
Straight up. You can do it!
You can do it!
Okay. You got it?
-Go, go.
-Good, good.
You got it, right?
it looks good there?
This guy was all
And I'm all,
"Buffay! Homicide!"
It was just so cool!
-You were supposed to take it back.
-I'm having fun doing good deeds.
You can get arrested
right now!
I'd better take it back.
I'm totally drunk with power.
Yeah. I didn't know
you guys would be here.
-Do me a favor. Taste this.
-Joey, wait a minute. Wait.
-What is with you?
-Nothing.
You're acting strange.
All right. There is something.
I kind of had a dream.
But I don't want to talk about it.
What if Martin Luther King
had said that?
I kind of have a dream.
I don't want to talk about it.
Look, it involved Monica.
You had a dream about the girl I'm seeing?
I love you. Your dream?
There was no sex.
I haven't dreamt of her like that...
...since I found out
about you two. More or less.
What was the dream about?
You were my girlfriend.
with Monica. I'll move out.
Joey, come on. That doesn't mean
you're in love with me.
It doesn't?
It could mean anything.
Like...
...you're jealous that I've become
and me being close and stuff...
...and you want that too.
In the dream
I did enjoy the closeness.
If that's what it was, that'd be great.
I wouldn't have to move.
Are you attracted to Monica?
Right here, right now,
-There you have it!
Well, sure!
I'm just wearing sweats!
But that's good!
You're not in love with me.
You just want a girlfriend.
It's not just about
We could sit and do crossword puzzles.
But could we have
the closeness like you have?
Monica and I were friends
before we dated. Maybe that's it.
Friends first?
That's interesting.
-You become friends after?
You're blocking the entrance.
Don't worry.
It's not a problem.
It's a problem for me, so it's a
problem for you, because I'm a cop.
So am l.
Okay. So you're a cop.
-I'm in Vice.
In fact, I'm undercover
right now. I'm a whore.
Who else is in Vice there?
Do you know...
...Sipowicz?
Sipowicz? I don't think so.
Yeah. Sipowicz. Yeah.
Big guy, kind of bald.
I don't know him.
Don't try to call him.
for his loss.
I sure will. Take care.
By the way, I'm sure
Sipowicz will be all right.
I heard that kid from Silver Spoons
is really good.
Where'd you find my badge?
Could you give me and Ross
But you know what?
I guess I could blow that off.
For you.
Let me ask you something.
I was talking with Monica and Chandler.
Boy, they are really tight.
I know.
That's not a bad situation
are so great...
...because they were friends first.
So I asked myself, who are my friends?
You and Phoebe.
I saw you first, so....
-What are you saying?
-Maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
You know, honey...
...as flattered as I am...
...that you saw me first...
...I just don't think we should be
friends with someone before you date.
But the way you do it is you
meet someone, become their friend...
...build a foundation,
then ask them out on a date.
Don't hit on your existing friends.
Won't that take longer?
Oh, but once you find it...
...it's so worth the wait.
I understand.
Good.
Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.
Come here to me.
No, no. You come here to me.
-I brought reinforcements.
The next best thing would be Monica!
I would be offended, but Monica
is freakishly strong, so....
I drew a sketch
of how we'll do it.
Rach, that's you.
That's the couch.
What's that?
That's me.
Certainly think a lot of yourself.
No. That's my arm.
I see. I thought you just really,
-Okay.
Here we go.
All right. Ready?
Turn!
Turn!
Turn!
-I don't think we can turn any more!
-I don't think it'll fit!
Yeah, it will.
Come on! Up, up, up!
Up! Yes!
Here we go! Pivot!
Pivot!
Pivot!
Pivot!
Pivot!
Pivot!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
I don't think it'll pivot any more.
You think?
All right, let's bring it
-I know. Me neither.
I mean, you had a sketch.
What did you mean when
you said "pivot"?
Man, I cannot figure this out.
Yeah, because it's not .
You guys, guess what?
I ditched a cop.
-What?
and he tried to bust me.
Damn real cops!
How far did he chase you?
Well, he didn't really. He just picked up
his badge and stood there.
Maybe we'll see you on
World's Most Boring Police Chases.
-Why did you run?
is like a Class E felony.
Two to four years minimum.
I am not going back to that hellhole.
If I can just get it to pivot...
...we'll be back on track.
-Rach, can I get some help please?
-Yeah.
Turn it off! Turn it off!
Maybe the firemen can help us
-It's a new couch! It's a new couch!
How's it going?
Make any new friends?
Yeah.
I met this woman.
What's she like?
Well, she's...
...really good in bed.
-You were going to be friends first.
You gave me a pickup line.
I told her I wanted to build a foundation
and be friends first.
Suddenly, through no fault of my own,
I became irresistible to her!
And her roommate.
What about the closeness?
Closeness, schmosness. There was
I found it on the second floor?
-Who is it?
-N.Y.P.D.
Oh, my God!
Just a minute, officer!
-I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay.
-My God, it's him! It's that cop!
-I can't believe he found me!
you guys go down with me.
Harboring a fugitive?
That's one to three years minimum.
Good luck, Chandler.
Arrest me, but you'll never
make it stick and you know it.
I have no choice, it's my job.
I'm calling my lawyer.
And once he puts you on the stand,
he'll make you look like a fool!
I don't like looking foolish.
Maybe I don't arrest you today.
Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
I'd love it if I weren't here!
Since you're not going to jail tonight,
I can't stop thinking about you.
You're the prettiest fake
undercover whore I've ever seen.
Nice.
I didn't see that coming.
You're asking me out.
I could've done it better,
with you, officer.
-Gary.
-Gary.
Okay, so it's a date.
I gotta ask you, though.
How'd you find me?
I ran your fingerprints
as your last known address.
Impressive.
Not as impressive as you. Your record
shows you've done some weird stuff.
We'll talk at dinner.
-So I'll come by and pick you up?
-I can't wait.
Don't worry, I won't just
I'm not satisfied with it.
You wanna return this couch?
It's cut in half.
-That's what I'm telling you.
-Did you cut this couch in half?
It's crazy, it is cut in half.
I don't understand.
This couch is cut in half.
I would like to exchange it for one
that is not cut in half.
We can't accept it in this condition.
Well, I can't accept it in this condition.
You're saying this couch was
in the amount of four dollars.
I will take it.
-Good! You guys are all here.
-What's up?
I have a job interview
at Ralph Lauren tomorrow.
Congratulations!
Oh, boy.
-Well, I got this pair marked "XS."
Let me tell you, there was no room
for excess anything in there.
I'll be the coordinator
of the women's collection.
I'll work right under the director.
you'll get it.
You want to work
on your interview skills?
Let's start with the handshake.
Very good handshake.
Good wrist action.
Let me try.
Oh, my God!
I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
The One with Rachel's lnadvertent Kiss
That's right, Ross.
I can see you in your new apartment.
Same as yesterday,
same as the day before.
Is he doing
There he goes.
Very funny, Ross.
Very lifelike and funny.
No, no.
I wasn't waving at you, lady.
Whoa, maybe I was.
This hot girl in Ross' building
is flirting with me.
Get in there, man.
I'll be right over.
Let's see,
she's on the third floor....
-She is pretty, huh?
-Tell me about it.
No, no! I'm not with her.
That's just Monica.
Hey, Joey!
Great stuff, huh?
This your place?
Yeah, of course it is.
You can pretend to be surfing.
I counted.
You're not supposed to live here!
Oh, man!
What happened?
I ended up at Ross' place.
I must have miscounted or something.
Damn! She's not there anymore.
Look, Ross is doing
he's just watching TV.
We've lost visual contact
with the suspect.
Okay, now I really have to go.
It's so unfair that
our date has to get cut short...
...just because some guy
-Then maybe I could come too.
Suspect has just emerged
naked from the sewer.
All right, you go.
-Oh, God!
-What?
Oh, I just miss him so much!
For just a week,
I can't help it. He's so sweet.
He's like this little
puppy dog, you know?
But like a really tough one
who shoots bad guys.
I love the beginning parts
off each other.
I know. It is the best.
How long did that last
for you and Chandler?
What? It's still going on.
Come on, seriously.
When did it end?
I am serious. We're all over
better than I do.
Why don't you just calm down?
Get all your facts before you tell
everybody you're the only hot couple.
God, I woke the beast.
I was wrong, obviously.
I just misspoke. It's okay.
It is okay.
As long as you know Chandler and l
and lower, doesn't it?
How'd the interview go?
Horrible! I did the stupidest,
most embarrassing thing.
Did you say you wanted to have sex
with his wife then fall off your chair?
Did you get drunk on the way over there?
Well, that explains why you didn't do
And the interview part went so well.
I even made him laugh.
He said something about a boat...
...and I was like, "Well, yeah,
if you've got enough life jackets."
Trust me.
It was actually very funny.
Anyway, we were
misread him and I....
You kissed him?
I didn't know what else to do!
You could have tried...
...not kissing him.
Thanks, Chandler.
A guy from Ralph Lauren called.
You got a second interview.
Monica, that's not funny.
Oh, okay.
A guy from Ralph Lauren called
You got a second interview
Oh, my God, Monica,
I got a second interview.
That kiss isn't looking like
such a mistake now, is it?
You don't think that's
why he wants me back?
Yeah!
No?
What are you talking about?
I accidentally kissed him
the girl who kisses everybody!"
Come on, Rach.
What if he thinks
I'll just sleep with him?
He wants you back because
you're right for the job.
Maybe. I don't know. Oh, God!
you just need a hug from Joey.
Come on. Come on.
She's back! Hot girl's back!
Well, I'm not totally back yet,
but I appreciate it.
No. In Ross' building.
She's back!
Wait there.
Got it!
I gotta check out this hot girl.
There she is!
Damn it! Did you move?
Yes.
I lived with you for a while.
Then I found this place.
I'm Ross.
Do you happen to have
a hot girl in there?
No, I'm all alone.
Yeah. Sorry about that.
Hey, little girl.
Is your mommy or sister or babysitter,
-Later, girl!
Oh, man!
Hot girl?
Hot girl!
Hi, Rachel. Come on in.
-It's nice to see you again.
-Thank you.
What?
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, let me
Okay, I see what's going on here.
the wrong impression.
But I am not some hussy who will
just sleep around to get ahead.
Even though I kissed you,
that does not give you...
...the right to demand sex from me!
I hope you're ready to put out.
I am.
You are not gonna believe...
...what that sleazeball
from Ralph Lauren did to me!
Okay, that's amazing!
How did you know that?
You got ink on your lip.
What do you say, maybe,
-We can't. We already have plans.
What are you doing?
Well, same thing we did all day.
Just hang out at Gary's apartment.
He is so amazing.
We never left the bedroom.
But have fun at the movie.
Well, we're not seeing a movie.
Then why did you ask us
to know what you were doing...
...so you wouldn't walk in
on me and Chandler...
...while we were doing it all night.
Will you excuse me?
Chandler?
Can I see you for a second?
-We have got to beat them!
they're a hotter couple than us.
So?
So we've gotta go have a lot of sex
and prove them wrong!
You've got to stop this
competitive thing. It's crazy.
Just to impress them, you want us
Get your coat!
Excuse me.
You should check this out.
Tell the other tenants.
Apparently, he's looking
for some kind of hot girl.
Who isn't?
I don't think we've met.
wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Never mind.
I actually thought it was unfair
the way everyone reacted.
I mean, you had just moved in.
I had just moved in!
Thank you!
Listen....
Jen.
I know this may sound a little....
But would you want to grab
a cup of coffee sometime?
Sure, that would be nice.
My number's on there.
-Okay.
I forgot my paper.
That was amazing.
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna
hear about this at dinner.
That was amazing.
We are the hottest, huh?
No one is hotter than we are.
-We're the best.
-No, you're the best.
-No, you're the best.
see through your sheet.
Yeah, that's her.
You know, it doesn't matter.
I'll never meet her.
It's impossible to find her apartment!
She lives in some hot-girl
parallel universe or something.
What are you talking about?
She lives on the nd floor,
th apartment from the left.
No. Those first two windows,
that's the lobby.
That other window is the stairway.
You've been counting wrong.
I did not know that!
because of counting!
-So you ready?
-Yeah, I'll just get my coat.
-Could you get that?
-Sure.
No! No!
First, I would like to say
that this meeting is being videotaped.
Well, first, I would like to start
by apologizing for kissing you...
...and for yelling at you.
Fair enough.
Now, you're probably going to hire
one of the people who did not...
...yell at you and storm out.
And I think that's a big mistake.
and I came back. That shows courage.
When I thought you wanted sex
in exchange for this job, I said no.
That shows integrity.
And I was not afraid
to stand up for myself...
...and that shows courage.
Now, I know that I've
you were making sexual advances...
...I said no,
and I was not litigious.
So there you go!
You got courage...
...you got integrity,
really good at it.
You know what?
I may regret this...
...but I'll give you a shot.
You are? Really?
Thank you. Oh, God!
Would it be inappropriate
if I gave you a hug?
Well, how about a handshake?
Oh, God! I'm sorry!
I did not mean to touch that!
I mean, you!
There!
I'm gonna leave.
after the day we had!
If you know what I mean.
Do you know what I mean?
Honey, the tortilla chips
know what you mean.
Do you like that badge I got you?
Oh, yeah, it's so cool.
Now, I gotta go.
on our way over here.
We were strolling through the park
and no one was around, so....
-You didn't.
-We did!
We violated section ,
Can you excuse me for a second?
Hi, Chandler.
Monica, this is the men's room.
Isn't it?
Yes, it is.
I've always found the men's bathroom
very sexual. Haven't you?
No.
And if I did, I don't think
we'd be going out.
Okay, I don't want
the guy in the second stall....
Sorry, man.
But come on, this is getting ridiculous.
Come on, we can't let them win!
We've proved that we are hot, okay?
So why are you obsessed about this?
Phoebe and Gary are in that...
..."can't keep their hands
off each other" phase!
So?
It makes me really sad that
this has all been about?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting
when we were...
...all over each other all the time?
Yeah, that was great.
That was really great.
But the truth is, I'm more
-Yeah.
I've never been in a relationship
this long before.
To get past the beginning and
still want to be around each other...
...I think that's incredible.
And the fact that
a little crazy...
...but I feel the same way.
You know what I just realized?
You just freaked out
about our relationship.
-I did not.
-Yes, you did!
Admit it. You freaked out!
I freaked out a little.
A little?
We have switched places.
I am the relationship king, and you
are the crazy, irrational screwup!
And now we're back.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this.
Thank God!
I can't watch him anymore.
You guys ready?
By the way, thank you for
-Oh, yes.
Is that your card?
Yes.
-Hey, guys.
-Hi there!
Guess what.
Ben is gonna be in a TV commercial.
What are you talking about?
It's not for sure, but...
...we met this guy in the park
He gave us his card...
...and told us to bring him
for this commercial he's auditioning.
This guy's the biggest commercial
casting director in town!
Ben takes one lousy walk
and no one's offered me an audition.
It's crazy. We were pushing
Ben on the swings
I'm always on the swings!
What am I doing wrong?
That.
The One Where Rachel Smokes
-Gotta go. Wish me luck.
-Good luck.
Since you work at Ralph Lauren,
stealing on my very first day.
Unwilling to steal from work.
Interesting.
If anybody gets free stuff,
it's me.
Okay, guys, way to wish me luck.
Go get 'em!
Let's discuss Rachel's birthday.
I say we throw
a surprise party this weekend.
But her birthday's
it's not a surprise.
Great! We can have a dinner party
and just invite her close friends.
Ross! We're having
a surprise party for Rachel.
Done.
Great. Wanna do it together?
I'd love to do it together!
They're gonna do it together.
That's my girlfriend.
So I gotta shut it down now?
I gotta go.
to the big audition.
It's gonna be weird seeing some actor
pretending to be Ben's dad.
Weirder than seeing his two moms make out?
Dad? There's a dad
in the commercial?
Yeah. The dad and Ben eat soup
and audition as the dad.
Who better to play Ben's father
than his godfather?
-You're not his godfather.
-What?
Are you kidding?
Of course I am.
-Okay, let's go, godfather.
has actually seen me in a play.
So I steered clear of her.
And the other one, I know from....
Well, you know.
-That kid looks familiar.
-Oh, yeah.
He's done tons of commercials.
I've seen him in Sugar Smacks, PlayStation...
...and that one
to switch phone companies.
Chandler was mad.
He's not gonna get this one.
Ben is way cuter than that kid.
I mean, look at him.
That's great.
Wouldn't it be great
if I got to play Ben's dad?
You look nothing like Ben.
I look more like him than you do.
I really don't know you
Nancy, I know you like this one.
I think I agree.
Rachel, what do you think?
Well, that one is pretty...
...but I just love this fabric.
Sorry.
Don't be. Part of your job
is to give your opinions.
Then I take credit for them.
disagree with her again.
Okay, now I'm kidding!
What a fun office.
I don't know which one.
But I do know I need a cigarette.
Let's take a break, go outside
and sort this out when we return.
-You smoke?
always tell me horror stories....
About ghosts and goblins...
...who totally supported
the princess' right to smoke.
And then they came back from smoking
and they'd made all of the decisions.
-That's not fair.
this disgusting, poisonous habit.
Yeah, it is the best.
What if this keeps happening?
They'll be smoking,
making the decisions...
...and I'll be up in my office
breathing in my stupid clean air.
And when Kim wants
Me or Smokey Smokerson?
We used to have
a smoking area at work.
It was great. There was this
big flowerpot with dirt in it.
We used to put our cigarettes out in it.
One of the old-timers told me
Say you want some fresh air.
I could do that.
Or you could do
the easy thing and smoke.
You gotta take long, deep drags.
Wow, I still don't have
my lung capacity back yet.
Rach, do you wanna go get coffee?
-I would love to.
I have so many ideas.
Me too!
Oh, look at that.
This is a little sketch
of the cake. See?
Some sample menus.
I thought we'd start with
a Tuscan-style finger food.
And for music, here's an
that'll go with the food.
-What about the intimate dinner party?
-We're not doing that.
Looks like you took care of
everything. Thanks a lot, cohost.
Wait a minute. There's plenty
in charge of cups and ice?
All right.
Fine. I will be
in charge of cups and ice.
-I can get ice at the restaurant
-I got it!
-How did the audition go?
Are you doing Joey's
"The audition didn't go so well....
Yeah, it did"?
Yeah, I am!
-Yeah, Ben got a second audition.
-That's great!
I had to teach Ross my bit because
so I thought I would come out here...
...and get some fresh air.
We're discussing the fall collection.
Oh, great.
Anyway, we really
-Sorry. We're smoking all over you.
-That's okay.
We'll move. You stay there.
I sent the designs to Ralph.
He was excited about it.
That's great!
Can I bum one of those?
Actually, this one's....
What's so funny over here?
I thought you didn't smoke.
You know, I thought you guys
meant marijuana cigarettes.
You know what I mean?
Doobies?
Actually, I thought to myself,
regular ones all the time.
We get high.
Me too.
I'm kidding.
Me too.
Oh, God! This is so nerve-racking.
How do you do this?
Fortunately, I don't get
many callbacks, so....
Is it a good sign that
to Raymond, Ben, Kyle...
...and Joey.
The rest of you, thank you.
Yes! I knew it!
Bye-bye.
So long.
Later.
I'm not married to him anymore.
He's my ex-husband. I'm totally gay!
This is great!
such different looks...
...we're putting you with Raymond
and Kyle with Ben.
So it'll either be
you two or you two.
-This is gonna be kind of weird.
That's why it's weird.
I thought we were just talking.
If Ben gets this commercial, do you
think you can get me some free soup?
Chandler, a can of soup is like  cents.
Yeah, okay, but I have been supporting
a -year-old ltalian for five years.
Is it okay if I leave this here
-Cups.
Good, because we got Rachel
 gallons of water.
That's a lot of cups.
I'm in charge of cups and ice.
And Monica's gonna rue the day
she put me in charge of cups and ice.
You know, I rued the day once.
the rest of the cups.
Ross, I'm glad you're here.
-I want to talk to you.
-What's up?
I've been thinking about this
commercial thing. Me against Ben.
The two of us competing.
I'll tell them that I won't audition.
Joey, that's great.
Thanks, man.
That's it?
You're gonna let me do this?
It's my career we're talking about!
But you just
I just said that
it should be Ben.
-What?
-Chandler, tell him!
Well, let me get the door first.
Hi, no one!
Why should Ben step aside?
It was his audition in the
first place. You tagged along.
You're like the tagalong dad!
At least I care about his feelings.
What?
You know how hard it'll be on him
he eats tortilla chips.
He plays soccer
with the cartoon tiger!
Are you saying your kid eats soup
better than my kid?
You just give him a spoon, baby.
Oh, yeah? I guess we'll see!
This commercial belongs
-Yeah? So is yours!
-How did work go?
-lt was great.
I went down there like you said.
And we talked business.
And Kim took my opinions.
You stink!
-Thanks.
and they were smoking.
This is actually the smell of success.
But there's something different
Oh, my God! You smoked!
I did not.
Yes, you did. You look
happy and sick. You smoked!
All right, fine! But I had to.
I had to do it for my career.
I wish I had to smoke for my career.
But it's so gross!
It's not that bad, you know?
Yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy
-I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm not myself.
I smoked like half a pack.
I feel a little shaky and a little weird.
But you gotta push past this, okay?
Because it's about to get so good.
You smell so smoky,
No on plaid, yes on pink.
Absolutely.
I'm so onboard.
-Didn't you just light that?
-Yeah.
But you know what?
I'm just really, really
trying to cut back, you know.
Good luck, Rach.
I've been thinking about quitting.
Every Sunday night,
Let's all quit!
It sounds appealing.
-I never could do it.
-But you could. Absolutely.
We can help each other.
We could get those patches.
We could be like the Patch Sisters.
You know, we really should quit.
Come on!
Give it! Out. Done. Quit.
My late husband gave me that lighter.
I'm not kidding.
Okay, then.
Mmm...soup.
Mmm...soup.
Would you mind watching Ben for me
while I use the ladies' room?
-No problem.
-Thanks.
So you want to be an actor?
No stability.
I mean, one day,
you're Dr. Drake Ramoray.
The next day, you're eating
ketchup out of the bottle.
It's a tough life. I mean, sure,
talk you out of this. It's a great life.
-Joey.
-Ross.
Ben.
I mean, Ben. Ben.
Raymond, Joey, you're up.
So here's what....
Are you sure that I haven't seen you
somewhere before?
No, I haven't been in any plays.
All right, let's try one.
And I've been working with tomato.
But that's okay. No problem.
Mmm...noodle soup.
You know, that's fine.
But the line is, "Mmm...soup."
-What'd I say?
-"Mmm...noodle soup."
How's that different?
All right. Let's try one.
Mmm...
...noodle soup.
Let's do it again.
Mmm...soup.
I mean, noodle soup.
We need to move on.
No, I could do it one more time.
Look.
Mmm...noodle soup.
Damn it!
So I think that if we get these samples
into the magazine by Monday, we'll be fine.
Sounds good.
So, Rach, how you doing?
-I'm great!
I ate  Mallomars today.
I mean, I have patches
all over my body, you know?
-I mean, I haven't slept in two days.
-We quit yesterday.
That's counting today.
But anyway, so these samples, I think
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry, I forgot. I have to go
and keep brainstorming.
Also, Vogue called.
And they were wondering
You know what? I'm a little hungry. I'm just
gonna run down to the vending machines.
All right.
Busted!
Come on! What are you doing?
What about all we've talked about?
You know, the disgusting place,
the ugly people.
Hey, how you doing?
We tried to quit.
But it was too hard.
If you started smoking again,
What are we talking about?
Don't you give up.
That's why we didn't tell you,
and we won't drag you down.
Wait. No, no.
Drag me down.
Forget it. We're so proud
If I catch you, you're fired.
Go on, get out of here.
I don't want you breathing this stuff.
So, okay. You'll come with me
on the Paris trip?
Oh, man!
Check it out.
that started it all the cup!
Great job with the cups.
Why don't you just go out with her?
Did you notice the ice? Look!
We have it all. We have crushed,
cubed and dry. Watch.
Mystical.
No one's eating my food.
They're eating her snow cones!
There are snow cones?
-Go, go!
-Thank you...
...for stating the obvious.
I deserve that.
I just want you to know that if we ever
cohost a party together again...
-...you can do whatever you want.
-Joey's got a birthday coming up.
-Really? What do you wanna do?
-Surprise!
What? My birthday is not
for another month.
That's the surprise.
Oh, my God, you guys!
This is so great! It's so unexpected.
I mean, Chandler's birthday
Look at all these...
...cups.
This is so weird.
I was in charge of cups.
Oh, okay. Not so weird.
-Chandler, what are you doing?
-Nothing.
-What's in your hand?
-Money. I'm stealing all the money.
Chandler.
But just one, okay? Because nobody
the audition didn't go well.
Yeah, right.
No, really. I am, Joey.
I feel bad.
Look, Ross.
You don't have to, okay?
It's not your fault I suck.
What kind of an actor can't even say,
mess up your audition because you suck.
Maybe you messed up because
you care more about your godson.
What do you mean?
I think, subconsciously
You lost me.
I think, on some level,
you sabotaged...
...your own audition
a lot better than mine.
It's not that I'm a bad actor.
No, it's just that I care
so damn much about little Ben...
...that it was more important
for me to see him succeed.
-There you go. Thank you.
-No.
What are you gonna do?
Is Rachel Green here?
I'm meeting her for lunch.
She doesn't come down anymore.
You'll find her on .
Okay, great.
So we talked
would be enough.
And I said, "Yeah, absolutely."
I'll catch you guys later.
Wow! You look nice.
What's the occasion?
Monica and I are celebrating
our -month anniversary.
Got reservations at Jean-George.
How'd you get in?
Made a few calls,
have chicken and don't get dessert.
-Hi, Chandler.
-Hey, Caitlin.
Somebody got a haircut.
I hate it. I look like
an -year-old boy.
If that was true, gym class
-Okay. Here you go.
Where's the chicken?
It's in the back.
The duck pissed him off.
He said that eggs came first.
-Thanks. I'll see you later.
-Bye.
What the hell was that?
-What?
with, let's see, my sister?
I wasn't flirting.
It was totally flirting!
"Somebody got a haircut...."
First of all, the impression?
Uncanny.
Second, that wasn't flirting.
I'll show you.
I'm good.
The One Where Ross Can't Flirt
I am so proud of Joey.
-He's gonna be on Law and Order!
-I know.
Don't you think it should
be called Order and Law?
No, because they arrest the guy
-And on your anniversary. For shame!
What's going on?
He was hitting on
the hot delivery girl.
I was not. And oh, God!
You were. If anyone
should be hitting on her...
...it's the guy who's single...
...the guy who can do
Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Is that what this is about?
You like Caitlin?
Ross, we broke up two years ago.
You've been married since then.
I think it's okay
at the pizza place.
And she was just so sexy and funny
and has the cutest little
We don't need her measurements.
Pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.
She's pretty and you love her,
but is she stupid?
She forgot my vegetarian.
This is perfect. She'll have
I will turn on the charm "au" Ross.
I am so glad you don't eat meat.
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Hey, everybody, look who's here!
You remember my grandmother.
-Big night!
-Yeah, it's so cool.
Joey on Law and Order.
a word of English.
I thought you were
Joey's other grandmother.
I've done it again.
Nonnie's my biggest fan.
She's the only one in the family
who's always believed in me.
Si. Big star.
My big fat Joey star.
Yeah, I weighed, like,
-Happy anniversary,  months.
In the shower I was thinking
about our first night in London.
Joey's grandmother's right there.
-The one who speaks English?
-The one who doesn't.
That was some hot love you gave me.
-I'll get ready.
them for something special.
-You've got to go home.
-But I like it here.
Get the earrings you borrowed.
He wants me to wear them.
I think they're in my purse.
-Thanks. Where's the other one?
Oh, what, you want both of them?
That's a little greedy, don't you think?
Rachel Karen Greene,
where's the other one?
Look, just don't freak out,
but I definitely lost it.
What'll I tell Monica?
She wants to wear them tonight.
-Tell her to wear her own earrings.
-These are her earrings.
You lent me her earrings?
-Because I lose her stuff!
You see that blind guy?
I'm gonna bash his head in later.
My big scene's coming up.
The big scene coming up.
If you said, "Big lima bean bubbling up,"
It's too scary.
It's a diaper commercial.
Yeah, well, you know me.
Babies, responsibilities....
-Pizza delivery.
-I'll get it! I will get that!
How does my hair look?
Ross, it hasn't moved since .
One vegetarian pizza.
you feel any better...
...I happen to like
-year-old boys.
What?
Your hair.
Before. Your hair.
You said you thought your hair
like -year-old boys.
All I'm looking for is the money.
Here you go.
Stop bringing us pizzas, you.
I'm gonna try.
You're welcome.
You couldn't let me have her,
could you?
This is a girl I really like,
with the hot delivery girl.
Thank you for that.
I was not flirting.
It's okay. I don't care.
That's fine.
Really?
It's no big deal.
I do it all the time.
You flirt with guys all the time?
It doesn't mean anything. Just like
You're a lot hotter.
True story.
This actually bothers you?
Yes, and I think
it'd bother a lot of people.
When you and Ross dated...
...did it bother you
when he flirted with other women?
No, it bothered me when
at the flirting thing.
What are you talking about?
It worked with you.
No, you're right.
We met, you flirted and then bam!
Nine years later, you had me.
All right.
You know what I'll do?
-Thank God! Where was it?
On your dresser.
Okay, that is the one we already have.
Here's my big scene.
My big scene's here.
-Wanna bet nobody heard anything?
-No bet.
Anybody home?
-Oh, my God.
my grandmother if she finds out.
What is it?
They cut me out of the show.
What?
-Are you sure?
-Maybe your scene's coming up.
Not likely. Because you see
that body bag right there?
I'm in it.
This is terrible.
old lady lives for my career.
When they dumped me off
Days of Our Lives, she almost died.
That's not good.
-Yeah, we had to get her a home nurse.
-Oh, my God.
Yeah, she almost died
Everybody smile!
Just tell her what happened.
It's not your fault.
If we keep talking this way,
won't we freak her out soon?
Soon. I'm gonna be on soon.
There I am!
Sam Waterston!
No, no. That's me.
but she knows Capricorn One.
I need those earrings.
We're leaving when the show's over.
But I already gave them back to you.
No, you didn't.
I already didn't gave them back to you.
That's what I said.
Where's that other earring?
It's not here, Phoebe.
Chandler's jewelry box.
Chandler has a jewelry box?
We have  minutes. Do you
want me to get into that now?
Hey, Phoebe.
How's that...
...vegetarian pizza
working out for you?
You and those vegetables
"Why are you being cute?"
Okay. I'm working on my flirting.
I did not get that.
So, Monica, do you like
Law and Order?
Yeah, it's good.
I found out all this stuff about you.
You like Law and Order...
...and you've flirted with every guy
but not for me?
I'm glad we cleared that up.
I'm sorry, but some things are
different for men and women.
Teach me about men and women.
I've already taught you
so much already, but whatever.
When you flirt with a guy,
Somebody who wants to sleep with me."
-No way!
-It's true.
-Well, that's pathetic.
-Again, true.
-This goes for all guys?
world wake up and act the same way.
It's another commercial
and I still haven't told her.
Joey, this is the last commercial.
-You got  minutes left.
-I know!
What am I gonna do?
You will not run out
Right back?
Meanwhile, let's talk about you.
So you're old and small.
-Did you find it?
-The earring, no.
But I found my sunglasses.
I've been looking for these
since last summer.
Those are mine.
Here they are.
-What do we do?
-I don't know. I don't know!
We'll just have
to tell Monica, that's all.
Oh, God! She's gonna kill me.
I could tell her it was all my fault.
Oh, that'd be great.
Mon, could I talk to you?
Yeah. What is it?
I lost one of your earrings.
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.
All right, what can you do?
I feel so terrible.
That's fine.
You didn't do it on purpose.
Look at you. Come here.
-You feel better?
-Yeah. You're the best.
Okay, wait a minute.
I can't do this.
Listen, honey,
I feel terrible too.
That is exactly why
I do not lend you stuff!
First, my jewelry.
If it's not that, it's my sweater.
And if it's not that,
-Mine, mine, mine!
Okay, here goes.
Prepare yourselves
for some class-A flirting.
Okay, hold on.
If you really like this girl, I don't
think flirting is the right way
You'll see.
What's her name?
Caitlin!
We can't keep eating like this.
It's $..
Do you make the pizzas in one
we don't have a problem.
You know that smell gas has?
They put that in.
-What?
-The gas is odorless.
But they add the smell
so you know when there's a leak.
Well, okay.
A lot of other gas smells.
Oh, the humanity!
Methane smells....
You know what?
-That's okay.
You guys have ordered so many
that this one's on me.
Was I talking to her about gas?
More so than anything else.
I found it interesting.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
In nine years, she and l
will be right there!
I'm gonna clear out
once you get past that part...
...where it feels
like you wanna die...
...he's a really good person.
The guy with the gas?
I'm telling you, he's really
sweet and really funny...
...and he's just got a good heart.
You know, actually, I did think that
-Really?
Well, we have seven people
and  pizzas. What do you think?
I thought Joey was there.
Yeah, no, but just I'm telling you
he's worth a shot.
Well, if he's so great
to have a longer conversation.
Hey, Ross?
I just ran into Caitlin
in the hallway.
You must be getting better at
this flirting stuff than I thought.
-What?
you doing me any favors.
I didn't.
She thought you were cute.
Well, that I can believe.
Hey, is the show still on?
Almost over, man.
Hey, Nonnie.
Is that the pope?
Why am I looking?
Oh, here I am!
This is my big scene.
All right, back off!
I got a gun!
I'm not afraid to use it.
That's right, Nonnie.
You couldn't have at least
filled with $ ,
Filled with $ ,
in small bills.
And if I don't get
Shoo!
And if I don't get it...
...I'll shoot this duck!
Oh, no!
I'm coming out!
And she's supposed to buy this?
Ground control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown
Engines
On
That's scenes from next week's show.
-Not as each other.
Then, no.
-Hey, you ready?
-Yeah.
You look amazing.
I'm the luckiest man in the world.
You're about to get
-Right, the earrings.
They look great.
Does your boyfriend have
the best taste or what?
My boyfriend really does
have great taste.
Thanks for picking out the earrings.
Okay, guys, listen.
Tomorrow, Emily gets married again.
So try to really keep
getting married tomorrow.
Oh, Ross! Look, look!
What? Where?
Right over there! There!
Look, look, look!
-What am I looking at?
-Somebody help me out here.
Hey!
Monica, sorry I didn't come by.
We saw and prevented crimes.
You got to go on a ride-along?
-I want to go on a ride-along!
-Me too!
-Okay.
-Yeah! Me too!
Really? You?
Yeah.
-Well, it's kind of dangerous.
-Yeah!
You didn't say
it was gonna be at nighttime.
The One With the Ride-Along
I'm so glad you're home.
We can finally organize these photos.
Oh, thank God!
Finally!
I've broken them down
birthdays, candids....
And I've cross-referenced
them by subject.
So if you're looking up, say...
...birthdays and dogs,
you get photo .
See?
Oh, it's me and LePoo.
Wow, I miss that dog.
You can also find him
That's the last one.
Oops.
Sorry.
Good thing you numbered them.
I hadn't.
Photo  was a prototype.
Honey, it's okay. It's okay.
How about I fix you a drink?
Maybe a margarita?
Ross has the blender.
Everything's just falling apart.
It's okay. I'll go to Ross',
get the blender.
-You get the margarita stuff ready.
Also, I need some cash.
Want me to stop at the ATM?
No. While you're at Ross',
if you see any lying around.
-What?
-What?
I don't do that.
That was so cool, man.
You cracked him.
He was the victim.
They're usually pretty talkative.
Okay, but it is officially nighttime.
-Want me to grab the berry for you?
-It's called a cherry.
It's called
best sandwich in the world.
Does it have meatballs?
Oh, yeah.
Melted cheese and marinara sauce?
Yep.
You can't eat that in my car.
Yeah, okay.
Even though my tax dollars
paid for this car.
Your tax dollars?
Yeah, okay.
Wow, that sandwich smells good.
Did I say you could smell it?
I can't smell it?
Half the taste is in the smell.
You're sucking up all the taste units.
Okay, I'll give them back.
What is so great about that sandwich?
Imagine the best sex you ever had.
-Are you thinking about Monica?
Please, please.
Please, please.
"Made in Mexico."
Yes!
Who would buy this?
Rach, it's me. Pick up!
What's up?
I need a few more things
for the margaritas.
I need some salt,
but I'm getting married tomorrow.
Well, maybe I am....
I keep thinking about you.
And I'm wondering if we made
a mistake giving up so fast.
Are you thinking about me?
No, of course you're not.
But if you are, call me tonight.
Okay, bye.
Where we going?
This witness won't return my calls.
make anybody mad, are we?
Come on, man.
You gonna squeeze the perp's shoes
a bit before he lawyers up?
He's a witness, not a perp.
And no one talks like that.
Yeah. No one talks like that.
-Oh, what, like you're Mr. Cop?
it doesn't sound cop.
It sounds gay.
Jealous.
-Hey, we're undercover here.
-Oh, yeah. No problem.
-Ross!
-Sorry.
There.
Hey, Gary. Who am l?
Phone home.
Look at Officer Ross riding
No, of course you're not.
But if you are, call me tonight.
Okay, bye.
No.
I know!
Thank God you were here.
We have to erase that.
What? We can't do that.
We have to.
What if Ross hears that...
...and calls her back and
Ross back with that controlling...
...neurotic, crazy Emily?
The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
No! Oh, no, no.
God, no! He should not
get back with her.
I know that, you know that.
to erase his message.
Look, I'm his sister and I love him.
I don't want to see him get hurt.
Doesn't that give me
the right to control him?
Help him?
He's not the one who needs help.
She's obviously unstable.
She's thinking about running
position she's putting him in.
And what's he gonna do?
Run over there on the wedding day
and break up the marriage?
Who would do that?
Okay, fine. All right.
But that was different.
Although it did involve
she's playing on him.
You are crazy.
She sounded genuinely upset.
I mean, listen.
Your messages have been erased.
No!
Well, that worked out well. Margarita?
Okay, but we're safe, right?
Nothing bad's gonna go down.
No. But that reminds me.
if you scrape your knee...
...or get your head blown off.
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
Here he comes.
What is he doing?
What the hell is he doing?
What is it?
-ls everything okay?
-What?
He sees us. Don't move.
It was just a car backfire.
Hey, look at that.
You tried to save your buddy.
You see that?
You see what he did?
You okay, man?
Thanks, Joey.
Hello?
Hi.
You all right?
We should go.
No, wait.
Oh, yeah. Right.
No. Monica.
Monica, we have to fix this.
What can we do?
You erased the message.
Yeah, but maybe I could call his machine
that I'm going to be getting married...
...to another British person.
And I'm having doubts and scones....
-I can't remember what she said.
-Yeah, that's the problem with this plan.
Rachel, come on. The message
is erased, there's nothing we can do.
He's never gonna find out.
I could tell him about it.
If you want to be rational,
want to be a part of it.
Maybe that's Emily leaving
the exact same message.
Hey, Ross, it's you. I just
want you to remember this feeling.
You are lucky to be alive.
So live every day to the fullest.
Love yourself, okay?
And also get stamps. Bye.
Play that message for Emily,
-Wait. Hold on.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Okay, go ahead.
So we're in the car, and bang!
A shot was fired.
And Joey, with no regard
have been a bullet.
Ever think about joining the force?
We could use a guy like you.
Who jumps at loud noises.
Wow. I could have died tonight.
Yeah, if the car that backfired
had run over you!
I'm gonna go home, before Ross starts
you weren't gonna die today.
What? You know when I'm gonna die?
-You want to get some dinner?
-Sure.
You know what? If I heard a shot
right now, I'd throw my body on you.
Maybe we should walk
and kick your ass on the same day.
Why'd you take off?
Just going for a walk.
Around the living room, whatever.
-ls something wrong?
-No. No, I'm just tired.
You know, from the walk.
You dove in front of Ross!
Ross!
That's what this is about.
Oh, my God. You hate Ross!
I don't hate Ross.
Of course you do. I saved him.
You're mad at me. It adds up.
You want Ross out of the picture.
What picture?
I don't know.
But it could've been a bullet.
And you didn't try to save me.
You're upset because you think
I chose Ross over you.
No, I knew you could
take care of yourself.
You know? I mean, Ross needs help.
before you would for me.
That's the bottom line.
No, not exactly.
All right, look.
I wasn't trying to save Ross.
Okay?
My sandwich was next to Ross.
All right?
I was trying to save my sandwich.
From a bullet?
-I know it doesn't make much sense.
-"Much" sense?
Look, it was instinct!
I just went for it.
You risked your life for a sandwich?
I know it sounds crazy...
...but this is the greatest
-Yeah.
In fact, to prove how much
you mean to me....
Here.
-Thanks.
-Easy, it's not a hot dog!
How good is that?
See?
What are you doing?
You're showing me how much
all the time!
This is just a drop
in the bucket, mister!
It doesn't matter. The important
thing is that you're here.
You're my friend and you're here.
Okay, just a little scared.
happened tonight.
I thought my number was up.
I had an actual near-death experience.
What happened?
We were on the ride-along with Gary
and somebody took a shot at me!
Really?
No. A car backfired.
But I thought somebody was taking
a shot at me. And, Rach...
...I survived!
And I was filled with
into your whole "seizing" thing...
...but Emily called you today.
-You talked to her?
-She left a message.
But it kind of got erased.
I mean, there's something
wrong with your machine.
What did she say?
Something about having second
a mistake breaking up?
And she wants you to call her.
Wow.
That was a good thing
that I told you, right?
Yeah. Yes. Of course.
Okay, thank you. Thank you.
Because
I'm gonna go tell Monica I was right.
Because she didn't want
Not important. Point is,
to get back into that?
Okay, look. Yesterday...
...I wouldn't have even
considered calling her back.
But my ex-wife calls
on the same day...
...I have a near-death experience?
That's gotta mean something.
That was not a near-death experience.
I'm supposed to seize, you know?
Okay. You know what?
Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.
Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Okay? Look at today.
I mean, you escaped...
...death.
And maybe this is a chance
for you to escape...
...getting back together with Emily.
That does make sense.
Because I do want to seize
some opportunity...
...but I really don't want
The message is blinking.
Maybe you didn't erase it.
Hey, Ross, it's you
That's an old message.
Nobody needs to hear that.
-Hey, was Monica here?
-Yeah.
I want my money back.
You probably need that
And not backfire...
...but heavy fire.
Like, if I was in a war.
Man, I would be great in a war!
I think I'd make
a fantastic military leader.
I mean, I know I'd make general
before any of you guys.
Before or after you were shot
protecting all of us.
If the foxhole was
lined with sandwiches.
Yeah, hero sandwiches.
You all know I'm a pacifist, so I'm
not interested in war in any way.
But when the revolution comes,
Want anything, baby doll?
I'm fine. Thanks.
I can't pull off "baby doll," can l?
No, I think we learned that
from the "sugar lips" incident.
I'll make some tea.
How you doing, pumpkin?
-So it's going well for you two?
-I know. Really well.
I'm gonna ask Phoebe
When will you ask her?
Tonight. But don't say anything.
I swear. I promise.
I'm so excited!
But listen, do not
get her flowers, okay?
Because she cries when they die.
Then there's the whole funeral.
-I'll see you after work, sweetie.
to move in with him!
What? Really?
He made me promise not to tell,
but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
I can't believe this.
Right? Because it's fast.
Because it's so fast. It's fast.
Relax. It's Phoebe, not you.
Good for you, Phoebe.
-So, what are you gonna do?
I don't know. I'll just handle it.
I'll ask you to talk to him!
Me? Why me?
Because you are
so afraid of commitment.
You talk to him. Make him scared
what good it'd do.
I'm less afraid of commitment
than I used to be.
That is so sweet.
Still terrified.
I'll take care of it.
The One With the Ball
Hey, Ross, is Staten lsland
Staten "lsland."
Oh, I thought it was
like Long lsland.
Also an island.
-What time is it?
-:.
We haven't dropped
but I didn't say anything.
I didn't wanna jinx it.
We are pretty good at this.
We totally forgot about lunch.
That's the first time
I've ever missed a meal.
I think my pants are a little loose.
Hey, you guys. Is Monica here?
I bought something.
I'm not sure she'll like it.
It may seem crazy, but I've wanted
show-quality sphinx cat.
How much did you pay for that?
It was extravagant,
but I got a good deal.
-How much?
-Thousand bucks.
On a cat?
It's not a cat!
For a thousand dollars,
It was the sweetest thing.
It would sit in my lap
and just purr all day long.
I would drag a string
and it would chase it.
Free cats do that too, you know.
It's not a cat!
I'm really excited about this, okay?
for Mrs. Whiskerson.
What am I gonna call her?
Fluffy?
Do you wanna get something to eat,
or see how long we can throw this ball?
The ball thing.
Wouldn't it be great if we could go
What are you in here for?
What are you doing here?
I am here to report a crime.
It's a crime that
we don't spend time together.
What's up?
You're thinking about moving in with
Phoebe, and I thought we should talk.
You know, man to...
...well, me.
Sure, okay.
Are you crazy?
Are you insane?
If you live with Phoebe, you two
It'd make me happy.
-You mean scared.
-No, I mean happy.
Scared happy.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to open your eyes!
If you live with Phoebe,
she is always gonna be there.
You get home, she's there.
someone that I really love.
I just want to be around her
as much as I can.
When you say it,
it doesn't sound so scary.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I think I do.
You know what?
Move in with her. Move in right now.
of the Mesozoic mastodon...
...they discovered what appeared
to be the remains...
...of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.
How did it get there?
Maybe this should be more
of a quiet game.
Hey, guys.
I left my watch here last night.
-lt was here. Where is it?
You don't have a watch.
Can you stop throwing the ball
for one minute and help me find it?
Oh, I don't know....
Yeah, can't do it.
-What?
feeling better, but I'm not.
Hey, Rach.
Check it out. Almost three hours
without dropping it.
Congratulations.
That's quite a waste of time.
You have scratches all over you.
Well, it's my cat.
-Oh, I got a cat.
like my grandmother's cat.
It's not sweet.
It's not cute.
I dragged a string, and it flipped out
and scratched the hell out of me.
I know this sounds crazy,
as paying $ for a cat.
You paid $ for a cat
when you owe me $?
Well, I was gonna let you
play with it.
Did you talk to Gary
a lot. You are a very lucky lady.
You are useless!
Freaking out about commitment
is the one thing you can do...
...and you can't even do that right!
Sorry. If he asked me,
I'd move in with him.
Get out of here, good-for-nothing.
Hey, Chandler.
Hey, Gar.
Hey, sweetie.
Can I talk to you for a second?
You look pretty today.
Thanks. Okay.
Here's the thing.
I really want this relationship
you're moving backwards.
No, if you're not moving forward,
you're staying still.
And staying still is good.
Watch this.
I want you to move in with me.
That is so sweet.
But don't you think
about each other.
Okay. I get it.
I don't want us to jump into something
that we're not ready for.
I don't want
to mess up what we have.
I'm worried it's gonna
for four hours?
That's right, baby.
-All right. Let me in.
-No, no! Don't do it!
What?
He's a dropper.
Oh, yeah. That's right!
I'm not a dropper!
It's really a three-person
game, you know?
It's throwing and catching.
All right.
Oh, it's so hard.
Don't worry, guys.
I'm gonna do with this thing.
Baking it didn't help?
Take it back to where you got it.
I tried. They won't take her back.
Maybe that's because she's
a minion of the Antichrist.
Why won't they take it?
They said they would only
give me store credit.
What am I gonna do?
show it, win some prize money.
Those shows cost a hundred bucks to enter,
and all you win are these ribbons...
...which technically belong to the damn cat.
You can keep it until you
find out what to do with it.
That's not the point.
that looks like a hand!
Oh, my God!
The cat's made my eyes water.
Don't throw it to me!
My vision's been compromised!
Oh, God! Okay.
It's okay. Man, that was close.
Yeah, you almost overreacted
to something.
-We have great news.
-So am l.
You're not more excited than I am.
No way. I'm the most excited.
See you at the station later.
I'll see you later.
Don't forget about the moving-in!
So you're moving in with him?
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad.
eventually, anyway.
Plus, think of all the money
I'll save on stamps.
Do you write him a lot?
I heard when people live together...
...they split the cost
of stamps, don't they?
-Yeah, yeah.
really freaked me out.
Hey, honey.
Did you find any apartments
in Brooklyn Heights?
No, nothing.
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.
-Nothing at all?
If it has a pool. I need a pool.
Can I talk to you?
Take a seat.
You okay?
You feel all right?
I feel great, because
we're moving in together.
So you....
You checked the paper for listings
in Brooklyn Heights, right?
You checked the Post?
Yeah, there was nothing.
-Can I get some water?
Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.
Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights,
Brooklyn Heights!
Oh, are these for rent?
I thought people were just bragging.
Let me tell you what's going on here.
Don't look at the table.
to move in with him.
Someone said yes,
but now she has doubts...
...because things are moving too fast.
Does that sound possible?
Yes, fine! I am someone!
You want me to say it?
we don't know about each other.
Everything I know about you,
I really like.
Things I don't know, I'll learn in
a place with our names on the mailbox.
That's so sweet.
But if it's too soon for you,
I want to move in with you.
Are you sure?
Definitely, yes! Let's live in
an apartment we both live in.
Oh, that's great.
Oh, wait, one sec.
Hey, you! Behind the glass.
Who are you looking at?
I always wanted to say that every time
-Oh, my God!
What's wrong with your baby?
That's not a baby. That's a cat.
-It's creepy-looking.
-Oh, no.
It's actually very sweet.
It's very sweet. Look.
Yeah. Do you want it?
No, I hate cats.
Then what are you doing to me?
Get out of here, all right?
You want it?
Maybe.
I was thinking about getting a cat
from the shelter, but....
-Okay. Why not?
-Oh, terrific! That'll be $,.
-What?
as more of an investment than a cat.
Okay, yeah.
I just wanted a cat.
Obviously, you know how to haggle,
so I won't try and take you on.
So $, and I don't call the cops,
Leave the money. Run away!
Run away. Damn it!
Can't you at least smile or something?
Did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
-I'm starving.
-Come on, guys. Suck it up!
We're closing in on  hours.
It's gut-check time!
I don't know who made you the boss.
We invented this game.
I made this game what it is!
Not fun anymore?
I'm still hungry.
There's pizza at my place. We can eat
-All right, let's go! Come on!
Let's go, Team Monica!
We can work out the name later.
What is your cat doing in my bowl?
I'm defrosting a chicken.
I sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Thank God!
-Get your money back?
-Yeah, $.
You made a profit?
I just came for the red velvet pillow.
-There you go.
-Thanks, Rachel.
Don't forget, you can come
I'll keep that in mind.
So is this some kind
of snake or something?
I like waking up with you.
I like waking up with you too.
Oh, it's such a beautiful morning.
I could stay here all day.
That would be great.
-We could have breakfast in bed.
-Wait, just a second.
Oh, no.
All right. Come on, Monica!
-I dreamed I was drowning...
...and not throwing this ball.
Oh, good. You're all up.
It's  in the morning.
Why aren't you at Gary's?
Oh, yeah. That's over.
Gary's such a great guy.
You can work it out.
-He shot a bird.
-That's terrible.
Are you okay?
I'll be all right.
Here, Phoebe.
I don't feel like playing.
It's okay. It's okay.
It didn't happen.
No one needs to know.
She's not an official ball player.
Only official ball players
can drop the ball.
-Come on.
the dropper over here.
How did I get this
reputation as a dropper?
I am anything but a dropper.
Ross!
What's going on?
My eye is a little itchy.
Mine too. Yeah.
It's really red.
You should go see my eye doctor.
I'm not gonna see your ex-boyfriend.
That's all I hear.
I've said his name twice.
Okay. So Richard, Richard.
It's not Richard.
It's this new guy. He's good.
I'm sorry. I'm not going
to an eye doctor.
-Oh, God. Here we go.
to touching her eye or anyone else's...
...she, like, freaks out. Watch.
Ross, come on!
I have a weird thing with my eye.
Can we not talk about it?
Hey, Rach. You know that great song?
"Me, Myself and Eye."
Monica! Come on!
All those in favor
The King and Eye?
Chandler!
Me too, me too!
Just stop it! That's enough!
-You okay there, man?
-Yeah. I got too excited.
The One with Joey's Big Break
I gotta go.
I'm taking Ben to the park.
-Give him a kiss for me.
in the middle of that.
I didn't mean to be so out there,
but I am furious with him.
Calm down?
I'm trying.
Man, that guy can push my buttons!
Why are you so mad?
-I don't wanna talk about it.
Keep talking.
Has anyone seen my list, by the way?
No. What's it look like?
-A piece of paper and it says, "Ross."
-I see.
I just got off the phone with Estelle.
Guess what?
I got the lead!
You got the lead in a movie?
It's really cool.
I meet this girl in the subway
and we fall in love in, like, a day.
And then she disappears.
But I find out where she lives.
This old lady answers the door.
for  years."
Chilling!
The best part is, we're filming
in the desert outside of Vegas.
-You know what that means.
-I know.
Road trip! We can rent a car.
Drive it to Las Vegas.
All right! Thanks!
What are we gonna do about my job?
Not go.
Great! Road trip, baby!
Is this okay?
Chandler, you don't have to ask
for my permission.
You can go.
Rach, we'll be late
for the eye doctor.
All right. Let's get this over with.
Look what I did.
I mean, look at this mess.
We're gonna probably have to
was gonna bother me, you are wrong!
All right, let's go, Blinky.
Hey, Joey. What's up?
I can't decide which route
to take to Vegas.
You've traveled a lot, right?
Yeah, I've been around.
Which route should I take?
The north or the south route?
If you take the north route,
that plays tic-tac-toe.
Well, back to square one.
I know a way that you can decide.
I'll ask you a series of questions
and you answer as quickly as you can.
Yes!
Good. But wait.
Here we go. I want you to relax.
Take a deep breath.
Clear your mind.
-Peanut butter or egg whites?
-Peanut butter.
-Be a fireman or a swimmer?
-Monica.
I always thought it'd be Rachel.
-No thinking. Tie or ascot?
-Ascot.
-North or south route?
-North.
Bam! There you go! Huh?
That was incredible!
Show him your game.
No, thank you.
What's with her?
I don't know.
I know how we can decide.
I'm gonna ask you questions
and you answer real quick.
-Action or comedy?
Monica or Rachel?
Dude, you are sick.
I'm sorry. I forgot you had
that whole Rachel thing.
Oh, my God. What does that thing do?
-An eye removal machine.
-I'm out of here.
I'm kidding.
Rachel, I'm Dr. Miller.
Monica said you were nervous.
-Almost, but first we gotta start.
This is a glaucoma test. Sit down.
Put your chin here.
Now, you'll feel a small puff of air
in each eye.
What?
A small puff of air.
Now, come on!
Here we go.
One, two, three.
I'm sorry. All right.
I'm gonna stay in here this time.
Ready?
-One, two
I'm gonna hold her head.
That's okay.
I'm sorry.
You're young.
You don't have glaucoma.
So it was very, very nice
to meet you, sir.
What are you?
in that left eye.
Take these drops for a week
and you'll be as good as new.
No, I don't put things in my eye.
We'll see you here in three months.
And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Give me the damn drops!
Dr. Miller?
P-E-C-F-D.
Very good, Monica!
-You know where they are.
are a miracle.
My eye is  percent better.
-They're still in my coat.
-Damn!
You ready to go?
How cold will it be there?
Will all these sweater vests be enough?
-What?
I'll miss him.
Thanks. I just got
that jerk out of my mind.
Is the movie putting us up
in a big hotel suite?
Not really.
I'll stay in your room.
Once you get paid,
you'll be springing for a suite.
They must be paying you a lot.
For every dollar Shutterspeed makes...
...one penny of it goes
right in Joey's pocket.
You don't get paid unless
of the movie?
"She's been dead for  years."
I'm gonna be a millionaire!
I wanted to say goodbye.
And to see if you guys would
place a little bet for me.
Twenty bucks on black .
-You got it!
-All right.
-You remember the number, right?
-You got it.
-All right. Bye-bye, now.
-Bye, you guys.
I'll say bye at the car.
Anyone wanna say bye to me
at the car?
I'll say goodbye to you at the car
It means it's healing.
Hey, Phoebe. What you reading?
Hello?
Come on!
Sorry, I didn't see you there.
Phoebe, are you mad at me
or something?
If you are, please tell me
what it is I did.
-lf you don't know, I can't help you.
I am very, very sorry. Okay?
Apology accepted.
So we're good?
I'll see you later, okay?
Bye, fat-ass.
All right!
Will you please tell me what it is
that made you so mad at me?
I don't know! I don't remember!
What do you mean, you can't remember?
I was so focused on being mad at you,
I forgot what it was I was mad about.
If you can't remember,
I know that much.
But I'm sorry about the fat-ass thing
because you have a sweet, little heinie.
I'm getting pretty tired.
You'll have to take over soon.
We've been driving for a half-hour.
You wanna eat?
My treat.
Isn't that Ross' money?
Ross' treat.
Where do you wanna eat?
I don't know.
I know how we can decide.
I'll ask you questions.
And then you have to answer real fast.
So clear your mind.
Clear it right out. Clear it out.
It's all clear except for this image
that pops into your head, okay?
-Would you rather be too wet or too dry?
-Too dry.
-Do you believe in ghosts?
-No.
-Will this movie be my big break?
-Yes.
-Dude, you said, no.
-I also said, yes.
-This won't be my big break?
-No.
I don't believe this.
Look, I just don't want you to get
I'm the lead in a movie!
They're not even paying you!
This doesn't sound like a real movie!
I don't know why you're dumping
all over my big break.
I don't think this is gonna be
to make me feel like a loser?
-I'd rather be alone.
-You don't want me here?
Not if you're like this.
The next time you ask me
a question like that, I'll lie.
I don't want you on the trip.
Why don't you pull over.
-Fine!
Wait! Wait! There's no sidewalk!
Yeah. I'm gonna die here.
Are you mad at me
because my hair gel smells?
Because I said your handwriting
is childlike?
No. That made me feel precious.
Because he's always
He's such a baby when he loses.
Okay, I'm the baby.
Hey! Stop it!
What are you doing here?
Joey kicked me out of the car
on the bridge.
-Why?
-I don't know. He went crazy.
We played that game where you
without my supervision.
I don't know what made him mad.
All I said was that
this wouldn't be his big break...
...that it wouldn't do
anything for him...
...and that it didn't sound real.
Okay, he should've
on the roadside.
-Who wants the one-legged teddy bear?
-I do!
-Not even close.
-I need help! I can't do this.
Come on. Let's do it.
Sit down.
-Okay, they are.
-How many fingers am I holding up?
-Four.
I was thinking four.
-Really?
-Yes!
Why don't we start
-Great!
On three. One, two, three.
My pillow's all wet!
Well, you said it was practice!
Why did you move?
I knew you were lying!
-Come here.
-What are you doing?
Stop it! Oh, my God!
I am going....
Turn it over!
I am going to get...
...get these drops in your eye.
Oh, my God! You really are
freakishly strong.
Stop! Stop!
Stop it!
Damn, it's empty!
If Joey and Chandler walked in now,
Joey or Ross.
Or Rachel.
It's Joey.
Chandler told me what happened.
He's really upset.
Not as upset as he'll be when he finds
out what I did with his sweater vests.
What did you do to them?
There's a well-dressed
something about the car.
Hold on one second.
-Hey, dude.
-Hey, Phoebe.
This wooden box keeps sliding out.
What is it?
My grandma.
And thanks.
He was wondering if
I guess he ran out of change.
How am I gonna apologize to him
if he won't even talk to me?
Send him something. So when he
gets there, he'll know you're sorry.
That's a good idea. I wonder where
a carton of cigarettes.
Because that way he can trade it
for protection.
No. That's prison.
I know how we're gonna
figure this out.
Clear your mind...
...and answer the first thing
-Fauna.
-Simon or Garfunkel?
-Garfunkel.
-Why are you mad?
-You said I was boring.
When did I say that?
Oh, my God! I remember now!
have never played chess.
Remember that time on the frozen lake?
We were playing. You said I was boring.
Then you took off your energy mask
and you were Cameron Diaz.
There's a chance this
angry with me because of a dream?
Well, guess what, now I'm mad at you.
I wanted to make sure this wasn't a dream.
Otherwise we're wasting our time.
Stanley!
Your leading man is here.
Let's get to work.
Slight change of plans.
We've shut down.
What? Why?
It's a money thing.
We don't have any.
You're kidding, right?
What?
It's probably just temporary.
We're hoping to get some money soon.
The money will turn up.
People always wanna invest in movies.
You're not rich?
Worth a shot.
Well, Joey, let me know
where you're staying, okay?
Hey, pal. Are you Joey Tribbiani?
These got left for you.
Thanks.
"Congratulations on your big break."
-Monica, it's Joey.
even though you're a star.
Come on. It'll be years
before I forget you.
What's it like on a movie set?
Do you have a dressing room
and a chair with your name?
Yeah, yeah, I got all that going on.
Tell Chandler he couldn't
Thanks for waiting.
Everybody smile.
Thanks a lot. Enjoy your stay
at Caesars. We hope it's toga-rific.
Kill me. Kill me now.
Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Go!
What are you doing?
Get off! Oh, my God!
Hold it open. Okay.
We'll see you in about
-Why?
Just because you're too lazy
to get up off your tushy?
No, it's just that all the people in the world
I would want to talk to are right here.
Sucker.
Hello?
-Hey, Joey!
Can you get it for me?
Sure. Where is it?
I scratched it on the ATM machine
on the corner.
So you're ---?
That's it! Thanks.
-Wanna talk to Chandler?
-Let me talk to him.
He didn't believe in my movie...
...which is a big mistake,
Break time's over.
-Who was that?
-My stunt double. Yeah.
He's getting a little too familiar
for my tastes.
I've tried to apologize.
If I can't do it on the phone,
that to you in person.
I got that. I forgive you.
Don't come out here.
You haven't taken
my calls for a week.
I'm totally over it. Friends forever.
a picture with us?
-What was that?
-Entertainment Tonight.
Good talking to you
and don't come out here.
The One in Vegas
Monica? I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm so sorry.
I ran into Richard.
-Which Richard?
-The Richard.
Richard Simmons? Oh, my God!
No, my ex-boyfriend Richard.
You know, the tall guy, mustache.
Okay, that actually
and I had lunch with him.
That's weird. I dreamed
you had lunch with Richard.
-Really?
-Again, Richard Simmons.
Go on.
The strange part was
but I didn't feel anything.
So why can't we tell Chandler?
It'll freak him out and tomorrow's our
anniversary. I don't wanna spoil it.
I can't believe you guys
have lasted a whole year!
Wow, I owe Rachel  bucks.
On a totally different bet.
-It's almost our anniversary!
your annoying friend Chandler.
Now you're just
my annoying friend Chandler.
I got you a gift.
-It's not till tomorrow.
-I know, but you have to open it today.
Okay! There you go!
It's two tickets to Vegas!
Yeah! For this weekend!
our celebration on the plane.
We can call it our "Plane-aversary."
Do we have to?
This is great, but Joey didn't want
any of us there.
He doesn't want us to go to any trouble.
He'll be excited when we surprise him.
Plus, we get to have
our anniversary.
You won't ditch me
like you did with London.
Ditch you?
You were pregnant
Great story. I'm going.
Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go
off, because this trip includes me!
I've got a presentation tomorrow.
I can't miss that.
I've got tickets to the Van Gogh
exhibit. I waited a year for this.
Art lover.
What'd you say?
I said, art lover.
-Was that supposed to be an insult?
-Sounds great.
I'll call the airlines.
That'll be nice to have
the apartment to myself.
To walk around naked.
No, so I can be by myself.
Have a little alone time.
Naked alone time.
Just because I'm alone doesn't mean
you don't walk around naked.
Why does it takes me so long
to answer the door?
So far, is this trip to Las Vegas
better or worse than the trip to London?
So far, it's pretty much
these candies?
I guess it's a little better now.
Las Vegas, .
London, .
I'll be back.
Happy Plane-aversary.
I love you.
-Can I give you your present now?
-Okay!
Oh, don't tell me I did this.
I love "l forgot the present" fake-out!
How about "I did forget the present,
when we get back.
This is the worst thing
that could happen.
You decided to tell him
about the Richard thing.
What "Richard thing"?
Oh, no.
What "Richard thing"?
Simmons. Go with Simmons.
I ran into Richard yesterday.
He asked me if I wanted to go
because you'd get mad...
...and I didn't wanna spoil
our anniversary.
I'm not mad.
Really?
So you bumped into Richard.
You grabbed a "bite."
No big deal.
Great.
Okay, London, .
This is gonna be a real horserace.
Oh, look what happened.
Check me out.
I'm in my kitchen...
...naked.
I'm picking up an orange.
I'm naked.
I'm lighting the candles.
Naked. And carefully.
Oh, my God! That's Rachel, naked!
I can't look at that.
expressive brush strokes.
Unless she wants me
to be looking at that.
She knows I'm home.
She knows I can see her.
What kind of game is she playing?
I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.
Dr. Geller.
Stop it. You're being silly.
Or am I?
Love to love you baby
Love to love you baby
Love to love you baby
Darn it!
May I come in?
Yeah, if you want to.
Do you want me to?
Yeah, sure?
So do l.
Okay, Rach, before anything happens...
...I wanna lay down a couple
of ground rules.
This is just about tonight.
I won't go through with this
just now with your nakedness?
Oh, God. You saw me?
You weren't trying to entice me
with your nakedness?
You actually thought
I wanted to have sex with you?
Oh, wow. I'm sorry. But, Ross,
-Of course. You're right. I'm sorry.
-Thank you.
-Yes.
-I guess I'm gonna go pack.
-Okay. Wait, one more thing.
Do we still need to settle
You guys.
This place is much better than London.
A lady dressed like Cleopatra
gave me this.
Ninety-nine cent
steak and lobster dinner.
You don't eat animals.
For ninety-nine cents I'd eat you.
I can totally settle down here.
It's got everything I could ever want.
I told you not to come.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Because I'm shooting a scene right now.
I play a gladiator.
Hold on a second. Can we cut?
My friends are here.
I'm gonna take a break.
Who are you talking to?
The director.
Her.
All right, it's not a gladiator movie.
Ran out of money.
I'm working here till it starts up,
if it ever does.
-I'm so sorry.
-Such a drag.
Sorry I didn't tell you.
a new policy of not sharing.
-I knew you weren't okay with that.
-So you're a gladiator!
What's going on?
-Monica had lunch with Richard.
-Dawson?
But that would've been so cool!
Her boyfriend Richard.
It meant nothing. After all this time,
and don't tell me!
You're right. I'm sorry.
I should've told you.
Thanks.
-There we go.
-Now I love Vegas.
I promise you next time
-So close.
There won't be a next time.
You cannot see him again.
I cannot see him?
You can't tell me what to do.
That's funny, I think I just did.
If you act like this,
-Happy anniversary!
Guys, please! Come on, come on.
This is obviously
a misunderstanding.
No, it is not.
Don't look at me.
I just work here.
Okay, Ross? I'm a little warm,
to the physical act of love.
Yep, that's hilarious.
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
You know, last night was
embarrassing for you too.
No, not really. You've seen me naked
hundreds of times.
But it was a first for the rest
that easily.
What? You totally get embarrassed.
No, I don't. Ross, I think I'm just
a more secure person than you are.
-ls that so?
-Yeah.
Hey, lady!
I don't care how much
with you in the bathroom!
You know, in Roman times,
this was more than just a hat.
-Really?
-Yeah, sure, sure.
They would scrub the floors.
They'd use it to get the mud
the horse would get dirty.
So they would stick it right
I can't believe this is how
I'm spending my anniversary.
I'll take you someplace nice.
A guy tipped me $.
He was playing blackjack
with a stick.
Wait! Why don't I just
do what that guy did?
I'll take this $,
turn it into $...
...and I'll turn that into enough
I've thought this through.
I see.
Thanks.
I can't believe this.
This is like the worst night ever.
You had a minor setback
in your relationship.
Big deal.
Such a stupid argument....
I don't wanna see Richard.
So go fix it.
Find Chandler.
He's probably in your room.
Tell him sorry and you love him.
You're right, Phoebe.
-Thank you.
-Sure.
Yeah! Las Vegas! Number one!
Anybody lose this?
Coming out.
Just keep walking, all right?
What are you?
I am sorry, sir.
I think he just really likes you.
You know that teacher who had a baby
with her student?
-Can I help you?
seems to have had a little accident.
-Can I change $?
-Changing $.
-Good luck, sir.
-Thanks.
That's right.
-Thirteen.
were exactly like mine.
It was like looking
at my hands in a mirror!
You sure you weren't
looking at your hands in a mirror?
Don't you see what this means?
-I don't have it all worked out yet.
But it's gotta mean big money.
Come on, identical hands!
Again, I must go back to...
...how?
This is Vegas, man.
People will pay to see freaky stuff!
How much would you pay
I just didn't get it right away.
Now I'm caught up.
Identical hand twins.
It's a million-dollar idea!
Right? I know.
Okay. All right.
What's that for?
Well, I gotta document this
before that dealer gets off his break.
I found my identical hand twin!
Oh, you're so lucky!
So where's Monica?
It's so weird.
She's probably talking to Richard.
Would you stop that?
You know what she said
after her lunch with Richard?
She didn't feel anything for him.
She loves you.
-Really?
to make up. You've gotta find her.
Good.
I should really start wearing hats.
Welcome to Las Vegas.
-Did you enjoy your flight?
-I did.
Thank you very much.
It was excellent.
-I hope you had a nice flight.
Did you go to a costume party?
Let me guess.
Pancho Villa.
And you're Bob Saget.
Pancho Villa?
What are you talking about, Phoebe?
I don't
Oh, my God! You drew on me?
Hey, you wet my pants!
What kind of party was this?
I've been walking around like this?
The men's room is that way.
It's the third time she's won
on a machine I was playing.
I bet she's one of those people.
Mole people?
What? No, a lurker.
What's that?
When you're playing a machine
and it hasn't paid out...
...a lurker waits for you
-My nana used to do it.
That's how she paid for my dance
Karate lessons.
Dance karate?
Yes, it's a deadly...
...but beautiful sport.
-lt won't come off.
-What?
It won't come off.
Oh, my God. Rach, are you sure?
I took it off
I'm sure we can get it off, okay?
-Just give me your pen.
-Why? What are you gonna do?
Well, I believe I'm going
to stab you repeatedly.
Not here. There are cameras everywhere.
You made it!
Who's your friend?
And I'm sorry about the movie.
Don't be sorry.
I don't need it anymore.
I found my identical hand twin.
Your what?
My identical hand twin.
The person whose hands are like mine.
-Were you looking for this person?
in my hand-shaped mansion.
Except you.
You can live in the thumb.
All right, baby, come on!
I am on fire!
See you later.
What are you doing?
What's it look like?
Going home.
Why?
Wait. Sorry, I was just playing
Richard again, I won't.
He means nothing to me.
Oh, come on. I was there.
I know he's the love of your life.
Not anymore.
Really?
Really.
All right?
Let's forget about going home
and celebrate our anniversary.
Okay, this is empty.
I wanted to make a dramatic scene,
but I hate packing.
Where's the other guy?
Which guy?
Tall, dark hair, hand looks
but he went to the restroom.
How you doing?
-Very busy.
-Right. Okay.
Yes, hello. I have a question.
I used your pen to draw
on my friend's face.
A beard and a mustache.
Thank you.
No, she didn't think so.
I know. It's like
everything and nothing's worked.
What do we do?
Thank you.
Yeah, it's not coming off.
What? What else did he say?
He said he thought I was funny.
Okay, look.
Let's just go downstairs...
...we'll have some fun
and you will forget all about it.
There's no way I am leaving
face doesn't mean you can't have fun.
Besides, no one will
even look at you.
This is Vegas. Hello?
There are tons of other freaks here.
There are tons of freaks here.
for that stuff.
But who cares,
because it's all on me.
That is one big drink.
Macadamia nut?
Wow! That's some pricey nut.
Really like those macadamia nuts?
Nope.
Get out of here, you lurker!
Go on, get!
You made up.
I couldn't be mad at him
for too long.
She couldn't live
-Use it.
Bye, Chandler. Bye, Mon.
Phoebe, Phoebe. Please pick up
a house phone.
You have a call from Chandler and Mon.
Hello, Chandler and Mon.
Hello?
You dirty lurker!
I'm sorry, you are the same old lady, right?
Take good care of those babies.
Excuse me?
It's me. Joey.
Do I know you?
Joey?
Yeah, the hand guy.
So, what are we gonna do
about this hand twin thing?
Nothing.
Look, you and I have been given a gift.
We have to do something with it.
Like hand modeling. Or magic.
And you know NASA's
People will love it!
And I wrote a song for us.
This hand is your hand
This hand is my hand
Oh, wait, that's your hand
No, wait, it's my hand
-That's okay.
-But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Oh, my God.
I look like my great-aunt Muriel.
All right, you know what?
We don't have to go downstairs.
We can bring Vegas up to us.
All right, come on.
We'll play some blackjack.
Here we go.
-Thirteen.
at this casino!
You win  dollars!
-I bet .
-Right.
A new pair of shoes
for the Chan-Chan man!
I've never seen a roll like this!
That's right, baby!
What do I want now?
Eight?
-Six.
-Thank you.
If you get this,
we buy everybody a steak dinner.
Eight it is.
We're not buying steak dinners, are we?
-No.
-Okay, good.
-What do I want now?
-Two fours.
Eight!
Don't you let her go.
You're a lucky guy.
Thank you, Mr. Drunken Gambler.
You get this and we get
the biggest suite in the place.
We get the biggest suite in the place.
The biggest suite in the place!
Come on!
I love you!
-Another hard eight.
Hard eight?
Let's call it easy eight!
I'll tell you what.
You roll another hard eight...
...and we get married here tonight.
Shut up!
It just got interesting!
What did you say?
You roll another hard eight,
as much as I love you.
I've never loved anybody
as much as I love you.
So if an eight comes up,
we take it as a sign and we do it.
What do you say?
That's a four.
-And where's the other one?
You look that way, I look this way.
Here it is, here it is.
That could be  or .
It's your call.
It's a four.
I think so too.
Oh, well, lost again.
That's it. You and me. Outside!
I wouldn't want you to lose a chunk
of that pretty blond hair!
Be cool.
Okay, your lurking days are over.
What?
Everyone you lurk,
I'll lurk first.
You move on,
every hour of every day...
...till Monday...
...because that's when I go home.
When do you leave?
Also Monday.
What time? Maybe we can share a cab.
Hit me.
Hit me.
We need more cards.
Yeah. And we also need more drinks.
Hold on a second.
Hello, Vegas?
We would like more alcohol.
You know what else?
We would like some more beers.
Oh, I forgot to dial.
That must be our alcohol and beers.
It's Joey! I love Joey!
Oh, I love Joey!
Joey lives with a duck.
Look, I need some help, okay?
Someone has to convince
I'm your man.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Fine. Thanks.
Hey, Rach?
How you doing?
I'm doing good, baby.
How you doing?
Don't let her drink anymore.
Here's that macadamia nut.
No, something else.
So, what do you wanna do now?
I wanna get out of the room.
I really miss downstairs.
Okay, you know what? There is only
one way I am leaving this hotel room.
Well, hello!
I'm Ross.
-Good luck to you.
This is my money.
Is that true, miss?
Sells drugs to kids.
She sells drugs to kids.
It was my quarter.
Was it her quarter?
How about we talk
about this over dinner?
-Okay, lady, you're out of here.
-No, you can't arrest me!
I won't go back to that hellhole!
I'm just taking you outside.
I need something old, something new,
I love you.
-Let's go.
-No, wait!
We need something old.
I have a condom in my wallet
that I've had since I was twelve.
That'll work.
I don't think so.
Now something borrowed.
Here, just take this.
That's stealing.
We'll bring it back.
-No, I don't really have any money.
Not yet, anyway.
Can't sit here if you don't play.
My name is Regina Falangie.

Would you like to see my card?
What did I do with my Filofax?
I must've left it
in Conference Room B.

They're identical.
I've never seen that
in the business world.
Stop it.
Miss Falangie, may I ask you a question
as an impartial person at this table?
Please stop it.
Wouldn't you pay good money
of an entertainment venue?
If you leave now, I will chop off
my hand and give it to you!
Didn't I just throw you out?
No, you threw out Phoebe.
I'm Regina Falangie. Falangie.
Come on, lady.
Please take him too.
Me? Oh, come on, man.
Come on, buddy.
Don't let him do this. Come on!
