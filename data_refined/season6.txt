Okay, this is it.
You sure you wanna do this?
Hello, Mrs. Ross.
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel.
-Whoa!
Is everybody getting married?
No running in the chapel.
Hey, don't you give me
any of your.. Hey!
Why are you here?
Ross and Rachel left a message.
They're getting married.
-Isn't that why you guys are here?
Did we miss it?
We missed it.
Maybe you wouldn't have
if you could run in the chapel!
I can't believe they got married.
I know! I didn't even know
they were dating.
I don't think they're as much dating
around in human form.
This is insane.
What's the big deal?
It's not like it's a real marriage.
What?
If you marry in Vegas,
you're only married in Vegas.
If you marry here,
-I don't know.
Do you have any clothes on?
Yes.
-Really?
-No.
But we didn't have..
...sex, did we?
I don't remember much
about last night.
It was such a blur.
I remember laughing.
it was a lot of fun.
Luckily, not too much fun, right?
-I don't think so.
-Oh, thank God.
Oh, I mean,
we were really drunk.
I'm glad we didn't
officially canceled.
Joey, I'm so sorry.
You want my breakfast?
Too depressed to eat.
I'll probably eat in, like,
five minutes.
I'll fly home with you.
What time is your flight?
-What about my cab?
You have to drive it back.
I don't wanna drive back
by myself. I get lonely.
How about if you come with me?
-It's a long trip.
-That would be great.
We could talk and play games.
This could be our chance
to have a "frienaissance"?
Sure?
All right. Although, I don't think we
need one. I never stopped loving you.
So has anybody talked
to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
They left me a message.
all my money back!
I gotta talk to you.
Sure.
What's up?
Monica and I almost got married.
My God!
That's huge!
Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited?
And who was gonna be your best man?
Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross.
I just don't think that Monica and I
are ready yet. I love her...
...but seeing Ross and Rachel
and I are moving so fast, you know.
How do I tell her
without crushing her?
Tell her she's not marriage material.
What?
Girls say it to me all the time.
And if she's anything like me,
she's just gonna be relieved.
How do I tell him that it's too soon?
He's gonna think
-Yes, I do.
Good. I was just testing you.
-Hey.
-Oh, hi.
We were just talking about bacon.
No, we were talking about tennis.
Tennis is more believable.
Thank you.
Coffee.
What?
Are we gonna talk about
what you guys did last night?
What do you mean "last night"?
our friends getting married.
Who got married?
You did.
What?
-Hello. We didn't get married.
-No, we didn't. That's ridi..
Wait, wait, wait.
I remember being in a chapel.
They would not let us get married
in Vegas are drunk.
Now, I'm drunk right now.
I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?
I'm on vacation.
What are you gonna do?
Well, I guess we find
a divorce lawyer.
Well, I think.. I think
be able to put in that pool.
Okay.
Now, this one's free, right?
Because you paid for the first two.
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you...
...because we don't need
to get divorced.
-We're just gonna get an annulment.
is the answer here.
Oh, that's your thing!
What?
Your thing. You're the guy
who gets divorced.
No, no, that's not "my thing."
I do not love getting divorced.
Yes, you do. This is
your third divorce.
You love divorce so much,
so you're gonna have to divorce it.
I'm so drunk.
-You wanna play some Pai Gow?
-Maybe.
But I kind of think we should talk
about last night.
That's a good idea.
-I see.
-So what should we do?
-I don't know.
I know I love you.
I know I love you.
Where are we on the whole
"going back...
to where they have the marriages"
up to fate again. I love you!
We don't get married
unless there's a sign.
So say...
you roll another eight,
then there's a sign...
that we should marry.
Eight we get married...
but , , , , , , , ,
-Ready.
Come on, eight.
Yes, yes, eight.
Eight, easy eight.
-I can't believe I rolled an eight.
-That was so unlikely.
Let's get married.
I guess.
Last night I rolled a hard eight.
It was the wrong kind of eight.
No wedding! Damn it!
I wanted it so bad!
Wanna go pack?
We're doing the right thing.
Of course we are.
We left it up to fate.
If we were supposed to get married,
Use them wisely.
Come on, Joey. You can't win
if you don't ask any questions!
-What?
-You promised me a fun road trip.
We've been on the road for  hours,
you are going to drive back.
That will be your punishment,
you greedy sleeper!
All right.
And until then, you are going
to sing to me...
...because the radio's broken and you are
-Sing!
I wanna rock 'n' roll all night
Man, this is a long drive.
Are my eyes open?
No!
Morning.
-Hey.
-Hey, hubby.
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about that whole annulment thing.
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
Okay.
So we'll just stay married.
Yes, exactly.
And I will make everyone
talk you into this more.
Now I'm scared because I don't
actually think you're kidding.
I'm not kidding.
Look...
...I can't have three
failed marriages.
I can't, okay?
I am not gonna be that guy.
Okay? No, no. That is not gonna be
stay married forever?
I don't know.
I mean, I haven't worked it all
out yet, but....
Okay, I know it's a bit crazy..
How is this going
to affect you, really?
I mean, you fill some form out
you check the box that says, "Mrs."
It's right next to it.
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
You know what?
We can stay married...
because I thought that the boxes
were far away from each other.
-No, they're right..
Just...
please take a moment here...
and think about what
you're asking of me. Okay?
I am asking you to do me a favor.
You are asking me to be your wife.
And as my wife, I think
you should grant me this favor.
We did make vows.
That kid kicked me really hard.
Well, you did pull his hair.
-He took my snack.
Hurts really bad.
Well, I told you not to walk. Here.
There. There. Okay.
-This doesn't mean anything, does it?
-No.
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?
He could be a rap.. He could be
a rapist or a killer or something.
Don't you think I asked him that
You go back to sleep.
-And, you, are you a rapist?
-No.
Do you like car games?
Yeah, you know
the license plate game?
I love the license plate game!
I'll play. I'll play.
No, you need your sleep.
to talk to me...
but I have an idea that may
make you wanna stay married.
We register...
and you get to keep
all the presents.
No, Ross, come on. No, listen.
I've thought about
about a little goldfish...
in a pond that freezes over
in the winter...
but I realized that was a story about
what to do when people pick on you.
So I'm gonna actually save that
-Oh, sorry.
The bottom line, Ross...
is we cannot stay married.
-I don't know if that's true..
-Oh, but it is.
Okay. You know what this is?
This is a difference of opinion.
-When that happens in a marriage..
-Ross, come on!
This is not a marriage!
get this annulment, I will.
All right.
All right, I'll do it.
Thank you.
Hey, hey...
is there any such thing
as an annulment shower?
There's the train station.
and phone number.
I have your name and the fact
that you're a drifter.
So ball's pretty much
in your court.
All right. See you, Phoebe.
Come on, Phoebe, I can't
Engines on
Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on
-This is..
-Stop it! Stop it! No!
That's not fair. You know I can't
resist that beautiful voice.
Phoebe, look, I am so sorry.
I promised you a fun
is an important part of friendship.
So I will strive to stay awake
for as long as I know you.
You can still sleep
at night and stuff.
Thank you.
So can we play  Questions now?
I got a good one.
-Well, you didn't have to catch them!
-You look like you're..
-Don't say it!
Don't even think it.
All right.
Chandler, enjoy your handful.
Should we just get married?
All the signs are telling us to do it.
I'm sick of the signs.
-I'm happy the way things are.
-Me too.
-I don't want change, do you?
Everything stays the same!
Go unpack. It's been three days,
and it drives me insane!
Jeez, relax, it's not
like we're mar..
You know, I was thinking,
and forth all the time.
Doesn't make any sense.
Okay.
What if we live together,
and you get what I'm saying?
Live together?
There've been no signs for that.
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Okay. Okay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Here's your key. Here's your key.
Now go out and christen it!
Go out and come back in!
Door hasn't been locked
-Ready!
The key broke in the lock,
and I can't get in.
Wait. Oh, my God, I can't get out!
-This isn't a sign!
-No, it's a very old key!
-It's an old key!
with the annulment?
Oh, yeah. No problems.
It's all taken care of.
Ross, thank you.
Do you wanna go see a movie?
-Yeah, why not?
-Phoebe?
No, thanks.
You're quite the craftsman!
Did everything go okay
with the annulment?
No problems.
It's all taken care of.
Ross, thank you.
Want to go see a movie?
Yeah, why not?
I'll get my sweater.
Want to hear something weird?
Always.
I didn't get the annulment.
What?
We're still married.
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Do you have any gum?
Wait! Wait! Ross, can I just
There you go.
We're gonna walk.
It's right at the Angelika.
The Angelika! Go! Go!
You didn't get the annulment?!
I know.
I tried, but when I got to
my lawyer's office, all I heard was:
"Three divorces! Three divorces!"
Yes, in that high voice.
I just don't want my tombstone to read:
can say whatever you want.
It can say,
You know? Mine's gonna say,
"Phoebe Buffay Buried Alive."
All I know is, I can't have
a girl who doesn't even know about it?
Woman. Sorry.
Okay, so I don't have it all
worked out quite yet.
Just don't say anything to Rachel.
Rachel is one of my closest friends.
But being the only one that knows
about this makes me feel special. Okay.
Okay, stop, stop! Phoebe?
Hey, Rach!
What was that?
Sorry. Mix-up.
How was the movie?
I haven't seen it yet.
You'd better hurry.
can I get a gumball machine?
Of course. Joey wouldn't
let you have one?
No, when it comes to sweets,
he's surprisingly strict.
Did you tell him you're moving out?
No, I keep trying.
with, "go to the bathroom."
He may think I'm sick.
I have to tell Rachel, but....
We just gotta get it over with.
Next time we see them,
we'll just tell them. That's it.
That's how it'll work now?
-All right.
Hey, man, you feeling better?
We have something to tell you.
Oh, my God!
You're pregnant!
No!
Look, Joe, here's the thing.
Monica and I have decided
to live together, here.
I'm gonna be moving out, man.
I'm really happy for you guys.
Congratulations. See you later.
Are you okay?
I gotta go. I've got an acting job.
Like you'd believe that.
This sucks!
I'll be across the hall.
I'm moving right back in.
Maybe that's now.
If you're gonna move in with him...
I feel it is my responsibility
to tell you the truth about him.
He's a terrible roommate. Terrible.
He forgets to....
He always, he always....
Who am I kidding?
He's the best roommate!
-Hey, Phoebe.
who marry people and don't tell them.
-Really?
-Yeah, I'm reading Ross Geller Magazine.
Have you seen Rachel?
-No, why?
-I have some exciting news.
You're pregnant.
No!
Chandler and I are moving in together.
Oh, that's good!
But if you were pregnant,
and my best friend...
shacking up.
That's great. That's great.
Guys, I'm happy too.
Okay, come here.
Big day, huh? People moving in.
People getting annulled.
I gotta go find Rachel.
If you see her, give her some really
bad news, so mine doesn't seem so bad.
Something bad to tell Rachel.
Bad news for Rachel.
just go live under somebody's stairs.
It's not that big a deal.
You'll have been divorced three times.
You'll have a life, you'll date..
No, I won't. I'll be at the bottom
of the dating barrel now.
The only guys below me
You are cute and smart and sweet.
That is much more important
than three stupid divorces.
Have you dated anyone
who's been divorced three times?
That's not fair. Most guys that have
all in your head.
-Here, I'll show you. Come here.
-What?
Hi. My friend Ross is about to be
divorced for the third time.
But wouldn't you date him?
And if you wait right here,
She's the only one left.
It's official.
We're moving in together.
No turning back.
Are you scared? Are you?!
No.
That was my scariest voice.
then your boss calls you Racquel.
Listen, for the first four years
of my work, everybody called me....
-Seriously.
-I believe you.
It was in the middle of a meeting,
guys were calling me Rocky.
Well, I still think you're
very, very nice and very pretty.
What?
All yours, babe.
Have a seat.
Listen, Chandler and I...
are going to live together.
Here.
Oh, my God.
That's so great!
I'm so happy for you guys!
Really?
And that was so sweet of you to ask.
The three of us are gonna have
such a good time living together!
Yes, we are.
Chandler, you'll have to watch
Racquel can't be late.
He'll work on that.
This is so exciting!
Come and knock on our door
We'll be waiting for you
See? Once you know the stories,
it's not that bad.
sexuality. Not my fault.
Second marriage
let you get married...
when you're drunk
and have writing on your face.
Nevada's fault.
So what do you think, ladies?
Who wouldn't want to date him?
The divorces don't bother me.
that were bad for me.
So I decided that..
Good. Good. Whatever.
And you, Meg?
Well, I don't care about
the divorces, either.
But I wouldn't date him.
Normally, he doesn't sweat this much.
It's just that he's obviously
still in love with this Rachel girl.
What?
She said, "He's obviously still
Rachel is my good friend.
And I have loved her in the past...
but now, she is just my wife.
Phoebe, will you help me out here?
Well, I thought you loved her
when you married her.
We were drunk! I would've married
Joey with that amount of alcohol.
You could do a lot worse
to be divorced three times.
Now he's using
this three-divorces reason...
because he wants to stay married
to her because he loves her.
I must say, well done. Bravo, Meg.
Fine. If this is what you think,
and get this marriage annulled.
She means nothing to me.
Nothing!
Okay, now I wouldn't date you
because you seem a little creepy.
I am so attracted to him right now.
When will we tell Rachel
what actually will happen?
Soon.
I just couldn't before.
She's my best friend.
Joey's my best friend.
I'm not your best friend?
You just said..
Of course you're my best friend.
Would you tell Rachel?
All right. At least I'm prepared.
Oh, yes.
-They're not for you. Are you upset?
-I am now.
Hey, roomie.
Okay, bye.
There's something important
I have to tell you.
Are you pregnant?
No, but I'm throwing this shirt away.
I think there was a little
wanted to live together...
we meant alone together.
Oh, my God. That's funny.
I can't believe I did that.
No, sweetie. You know what?
This is my fault.
I wasn't clear.
I'm really sorry.
Listen, you take as much time
-I made them.
Oh, God, they're so yummy!
-Okay, whose is this?
-That's mine.
-And what about this? Whose is this?
-That's mine.
Okay, whose dishwashing soap is this?
That was here when we moved in.
Oh, I guess it really is concentrated.
It's gonna be weird when I come home
Can't. It's not there.
I'll be across the hall.
We can still do all the same stuff.
We won't be able to have
those long talks at night...
about our feelings and the future.
Not once did we do that.
Don't you remember that night,
I would feel better tomorrow?
Oh, yeah. I remember that.
I don't know.
I'm just gonna miss living with you.
Yeah, me too, man.
-What the hell is that?
-That's disgusting.
I told Rachel that it's just
She wasn't angry or sad.
And you're upset because you
didn't make your best friend cry?
All I'm asking for is
a little emotion.
Is that too much to ask
not as close as you guys?
I mean, did we not have as much fun?
Don't I deserve a few tears?
When we told Joey,
he cried his eyes out.
I did not cry my eyes out!
Come on, it's like the end of an era.
No more J-Man and Channy's!
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?
You got married again?
Yes.
So that's your second marriage
for  years...
and never have I had
so much business from one client.
Why don't you tell me what happened?
Basically, Rachel and I were
in Vegas, and we got drunk.
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel
in the second marriage?
Yes, yes, yes.
But I do not love her.
That's better then.
This was just a drunken mistake,
and I need to get it annulled.
I see.
Have you considered therapy?
I think just the annulment for today.
-There are some forms to fill out.
-Easy.
We'll need witnesses who can testify
to testify before a judge.
There's no way to do this without her?
Because I kind of already told her
it was taken care of.
Of course you did.
Look, you can't get an annulment
unless you and Rachel are both there.
What about someone
should start dividing up our stuff.
Okay.
No point in dragging it out.
Dragging out the long process
of you moving out...
and us not living together anymore.
What about this? Who gets this?
I don't know if I want it because
it might be too many memories.
-What is that?
I want you to have the big plate.
Wow, Monica, thanks.
I love this plate.
Something to remember me by.
Mon, you're not dying.
I'm just moving out.
We're gonna see each other
how it's an end of an era.
Oh, all right.
But I gotta say, I don't think
six years counts as an era.
An era is defined as
a significant period of time.
It was significant for me.
-What is the matter with you?!
Why aren't you more upset?
Aren't you gonna be sad
that we're not living together?
Aren't you gonna miss me at all?
Monica, all right.
But don't get mad at me.
It's just a little hard to believe.
What's hard to believe?
I mean, it's you guys.
and then you backed out.
I'm not upset because I don't see you
going through with it. I'm sorry.
It's going to happen.
Chandler will move in here.
-But I..
-I know, just let me finish, okay?
This isn't something that we just
that we both really want.
And it is going to happen.
It is?
Really?
Yeah, sweetie.
You mean, we're not gonna
live together anymore?
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
I'm gonna miss you.
I mean, it's the end of an era!
I know!
-Okay, bye.
-I knew it. Because you love Rachel.
It's not that.
Annulments are more complicated..
Complicated because of the love.
I do not love Rachel.
I'm telling her
about the whole thing...
so we can get this marriage
of your love for her.
I do not have feelings
for Rachel, okay?
Oh, what's wrong?
Monica and Chandler are
moving in here...
and I have to move out
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
-Thank you.
-Of course.
So Ross and Rachel got married.
Monica and Chandler
almost got married.
You think we should hook up?
Oh, we do.
But not just yet.
Really? Well, when?
Well, first Chandler and Monica
for the money.
And you'll marry Rachel
and have the beautiful kids.
Great.
But then we ditch them
and we get married.
We'll have Chandler's money
because of Rachel's drinking problem.
What about Ross?
I don't want to go
into the whole thing.
But we have words and I kill him.
Check it out, this is unbelievable!
Joey's been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.
You trying to kill me?
-I want to ask you something.
and you're so beautiful...
how about I move in with you?
That would be great,
but what do we do about Denise?
-Who's Denise?
-My roommate.
Your roommate?
Yes, Denise. Denise!
What is with the secrecy, Phoebe?
What about Denise? She cute?
How can you have a roommate
to what I say.
I talk about her all the time.
Denise!
I'm gonna have an extra room
over at my place.
-That's true.
and watch movies.
You know about
naked Thursdays, right?
Yeah, yeah. I think
I'll find my own place.
Hey! I thought naked Thursdays
you were still married to her?
Oh, that.
She took it really well.
-You didn't tell her, did you?
-No.
Because you're in love with her.
I am not in love with her. She was
upset about having to move out.
If she knew we were still married,
As a friend.
You "comforted her"?
Nothing.
I just gave her a hug.
A classic sign of love,
the hug.
It's also a sign of friendship.
Not in your case, "Lovey Loverson."
It was a hug. Okay?
A simple hug.
I was a friend being a friend
smell her hair?
Smell her hair?
What if I did?
Ninety percent of a woman's
pheromones come out of her head.
That's why women are shorter.
So that men will fall in love
when they hug them.
Come on, Ross,
her hair got in my face.
She's got a lot of it,
and it smells all... all...
coconutty.
What? It doesn't mean
I have feelings for Rachel.
Maybe it means
in the same place you are.
If the place you're
referring to is being in love...
she is in the same place as me,
because I am not in that place.
I didn't understand that.
Maybe that's because you were
-Who was it?
I don't know. How about
"Thanks for taking the message"?
When you move in...
Rachel's room will be empty.
Let's talk about what to do with it.
I think we should have
bedside tables with fresh flowers.
And comment cards so people could
tell us how great their stay was.
I really haven't
thought about it that much.
Well, I like that idea... obviously.
I was thinking maybe...
Space lnvaders and Asteroids...
for $. The real ones.
The big, big, big ones!
No.
"What an interesting idea. Let's
discuss it before we reject it."
I'm sorry.
Interesting idea. But no.
So that's it?
I just don't think arcade games
perfect. It's the oldest game.
What's wrong with
a beautiful guest room?
I'm not against it.
Especially since everybody we know
lives about  seconds away.
Are you mocking me?
No, I'm not mocking you
had a stupid fight.
You're still moving in together,
right? My ad came out today.
nonsmoker, nonugly."
Nice.
I figured it'd be more interesting
Someone who's different than me.
And what's more different than me,
a guy who's not ...
than a girl who is ?
Not just a hatrack, my friend.
Phoebe, I have to ask you..
I'm swamped right now.
You're just staring into space.
I'm trying to move that pencil.
-This one?
-lt worked!
Phoebe, this whole apartment thing
a roommate who is a freak. Look.
"Wanted Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly."
That's probably some -year-old kid
trying to get girls to call.
There's nothing. This city is full.
Wait! Look at this!
"Two bedroom, two bath. Must be
-Yeah, why?
This guy, Warren, from the museum
is going on a dig for two years.
He's got this great place he needs
to sublet. You interested?
Great! I'd love to live at Warren's.
for naked pictures of me?
That doesn't matter,
he won't be there!
-Thank you!
-Don't thank me.
Thank the volcano that erupted
an entire civilization.
Here's Warren's number.
This is great. I'm gonna
call him right now! Thank you!
Okay, you go call him.
I saw it.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about what you already
know but won't admit.
You love her again. You re-love her.
I do not re-love her.
I can't believe
you won't do anything stupid.
We're just friends now.
Why would I do anything stupid?
The apartment
is already subletted.
It's hopeless.
-What?!
What?
Are you serious?
I would love to live with you.
That's great. Thank you.
I'm just glad I could help you out.
Wow, I'm so happy for you guys.
This is so, so, not stupid.
Ross, you have no idea
You just saved me. You're my hero.
Hero? I don't know.
Well, all right.
I have to go tell Monica
what a wonderful brother she has.
Oh, please.
You're gonna say things now,
roommate, Denise.
She moved in with a guy
who was secretly married to her.
He said he didn't love her, but he
really did. And it just blew up.
And that's how she ended up
-Denise!
No one ever listens to me!
Listen, I'm sorry about before.
I don't need a game room.
I only played those games because I
couldn't get girls. Now I can get..
Now I have you.
No, not that I think I have you...
or think of you as property
-Yeah. Oh, yes.
We can think of something
to do with the room together.
Great idea. We can easily think of
a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Totally.
-We don't have to decide now.
we can make in the living room.
Changes?
We'll have to move some
furniture to make room for my chair.
You're bringing the Barcalounger
over here?
Is that a problem?
It's just that they're a set
I'll bring them both over.
You're taking them away
from their home.
I get it. I get nothing. Nothing
here is mine. Everything is yours.
I'll get up in the morning, put on
Nothing will be yours.
I'm talking about the Barcalounger.
It doesn't match.
Where will it go?
In the game room!
It is not my fault your
chairs are incredibly ugly.
That's fine.
I won't bring the chairs.
over here at grandma's place!
Everything on your application
looks really good.
Just one last question.
Will your friends be over here,
partying and hanging out?
Don't worry.
about your answers.
Call off the roommate search.
Hi. I'll be living here.
Ignore him. He's just some
guy who wants the apartment.
But he's not going to get it.
You took down the shower curtain?
That thing was a hazard!
I'm very safety conscious.
I was just clearing some space
big fight and they're not moving in.
What do you mean, not moving in?
They're still moving in, right?
No, they just had a big blowout
over what to do with my room.
Over a stupid room?
I feel kind of bad for them, but now
about you guys fighting?
Is this really over a room?
That is so silly.
-We can handle this.
-Apparently not.
And I can't stand by and watch
two people I care about so much...
be hurt by something
one-millionth as happy...
as you've been
since you got together.
Do you really want
to throw that all away over a room?
That is so silly.
What's more important, love...
or silliness?
Well, we are fond of the silliness.
But we also have a soft spot
-That's "laughter."
-Why do you do it?
-I don't know.
Now, Chandler, you want
to live with Monica, right?
Yeah, I do.
And, Mon, you want
in the state of New York!
So I understand you're
looking for a place?
No, I'm staying put.
I was going to offer you
my apartment.
Why? Where you going?
I don't know.
You won't believe it.
Monica and Chandler
I mean, for them, right?
But on the bright side,
we get to be roommates again.
Yeah. You know, about that....
I really appreciate your offer
to let me move in and everything...
but don't you think
Why would it be weird?
Well, you know,
because of us.
Because of our history.
No!
No, no!
It would only be weird
if we were still in "that place."
Are you still in that place?
-No, not at all.
who happen to be roommates.
Okay, but eventually
you and I will be dating.
Really? We are?
Yeah. I'll have a boyfriend
and you'll have a girlfriend.
That'd be great.
But if you think it'll be okay,
I'll hang a sign on the door
"Come back later.
I'm getting lucky."
Yeah, I didn't think of that.
So are you sure about
this whole moving-in thing?
It's a really big step.
he knows we enjoy the silliness.
No, I'm serious.
Think about it. You move in.
You start fighting over game rooms.
Next thing you know, you break up.
It was just a stupid fight
what the room represents.
And unfortunately,
this room could destroy you!
-I'm not so worried.
-Me neither.
Fine. It's your life!
I just don't want
if you move in together.
But if that's what you want,
there's nothing I can do.
Don't do it!
-You still want to move in together?
-Of course.
Ross didn't scare you?
Scared me out of wanting
-Okay.
Oh, my God!
Someone's killed Square Man!
The Barcalounger can go here.
You can see the TV, and it's still
walking distance to the kitchen.
Oh, that's so sweet.
I want to show you
that say "merge"?
I thought we could get one of those
signs and hang it over our bed.
Because that's you and I together.
"Merge!"
-I love that!
-Really?
"No!"
I found you in my bed
How'd you wind up there?
You are a mystery
Little black curly hair
Little black, little black,
about my upcoming shows...
please give me money
so I can buy a computer.
Where are the other guys?
Well, Monica and Chandler
are occupied.
-Fighting?
is there?
Can I borrow the key to your house
so I can go make a copy?
-Here.
-Thank you.
Are you sure? Once I make
of here before I change my mind.
You think moving in
with Rachel is a good idea?
I've been back and forth.
Well, maybe you should go back.
She moves in,
and before you know it...
you're right where you don't
talking about dating other guys.
That's not going to work out.
She'll come home all weepy...
and you'll be telling her, "Oh,
that's okay. You'll find someone."
And then, bam! She finds you!
Maybe you're right.
Ross, she is definitely
make your life much easier.
The place was closed,
so I'll copy it later.
Or not.
Why don't you move in with me?
Whoa, Joey!
Look, I know I scared you with
that whole naked-Thursdays thing...
but we don't have to do that.
It would be easier
naked Wednesdays.
Thursday's clearly not good for you.
Pick a day!
Come on in.
Thanks for coming back.
There's a lot of people
and you're one of the finalists.
-Great!
-Before I decide...
I want to be sure
our personalities match.
So I made up a little test.
I'll say a word, and you say
-Okay, here we go.
-Pillow.
-Fight.
Very good.
"G."
-String?
-Excellent!
Doggy.
-Kitten?
kitchen stuff is mine?
This bottle opener.
-And...?
-And it's a magnet.
Look at that!
How weird is that?
You're moving in with me...
and you have the one thing
you complete me.
-Kitchen.
-What?
You complete me kitchen, matey!
I know what you're thinking.
That she'll move in with you, then
fall in love with you, and then...
when she finds out you're already
You are in love with Rachel!
It all adds up! You're obsessed
"What will you do about Rachel?
Why are you moving in with Rachel?
When will you confess your secret
And thank you again.
That was the head
of the paleontology department...
at N...
Y...
U.
Wow. What...
did he...
say?
Remember that paper I had published
last year on sediment flow rate?
-They loved it.
to be a guest lecturer.
It's temporary, but if they like me,
it could lead to a full-time job.
How great would that look
on the mailbox? Professor Geller.
Professor and Mrs.
And Mrs.?
You and Ross are still married.
What?
Just kidding!
Oh, God!
Saved your ass.
The One Where Joey Loses His lnsurance
What's the matter?
You know that psychic I see?
She told me I'm gonna die this week,
but that's the worst you can get.
That's crazy.
She'd say that to you?
You don't believe her, do you?
I don't know. She said
that I'd have triplets...
but she also said one of them
would be black.
Just out of curiosity,
till the end of the session.
I wasn't gonna waste
a whole other hour there!
I've only got a week left.
I've really gotta start living now!
Hey, everyone.
Well, today's my first lecture...
and I wanted to try it out
on you guys. Do you mind?
No, that'd be great!
"There are three primary theories
subcategorized into two..."
This is it.
This is what's gonna kill me.
"...subcategories. The first
of these subcategories is.."
Are there naked chicks
something that didn't have chicks on it.
"There are three primary theories...
concerning sediment flow rate.
Each of these theories...
can be further subcategorized...
into.."
Why don't you open with a joke?
Open with a joke?
It's a university, not a comedy club.
Wait a minute, hold the phone.
You're not talking
about Chuckles University?
Come on, we're kidding.
You know what might make it
-Don't say naked chicks.
Why not?
I don't even know why I talk
to you guys about it.
I'm just gonna do it on my own,
with no naked chicks.
That's the way I did it
the Screen Actors Guild.
It's probably a residual check.
Can you open it? I got....
"Benefits lapsed."
That's weird.
I don't remember being in a movie
called Benefits Lapsed.
It's not a check. Your health
-Let me see that.
Oh, I can't believe this!
This sucks!
When I had insurance,
I could get hit by a bus...
or catch on fire, you know?
And it wouldn't matter.
Now I gotta be careful?
I'm sorry. There's never
before you cross the street.
"Make sure to look both ways
before you cross the street."
Hey, you're still alive!
How are you feeling?
It's so exhausting, waiting for death.
Oh, by the way, do you think you..
What are you doing?
Preparing you for..
Didn't you think I was dead?
Did that not come off?
Yeah, scared the hell out of me.
-Yeah, thanks.
Can you do me a favor?
Wake me up in a couple hours.
You know, if you can.
Did you take these back?
I liked them so much
that I bought some for myself.
They're really great, aren't they?
I love them.
Nice try.
How'd the lecture go?
It went great.
And I didn't need any jokes
or naked chicks either.
That's great. I'm sorry
the material speak for itself.
Everyone's all, "Ross, you have
to be funny and sexy."
Well, I proved them wrong!
And now I'm gonna pass
the news on to Joey and Chandler.
-That you're not funny or sexy?
-Well, well, well.
Joey Tribbiani.
So you came back, huh?
They think they can do better,
but they all...
come crawling back to Estelle.
What are you talking about?
I never left you.
You've always been my agent.
Really?
Oh, well, no harm no foul.
Look, you gotta get me some work.
damage control.
-Why?
-Well, I think...
someone out there...
may have been bad-mouthing you
all over town.
The bastard!
We're early.
-Yeah, we could.
Hey, look. There's some
Kappa Kappa Deltas. I was a Kappa.
Hey, sisters.
Wow, we really are bitches.
Right. So when Rigby got his samples
back from the laboratory...
he made a startling discovery.
What he believed to be igneous
of auditions for me tomorrow.
And I'll have my health insurance
back in no time.
That's great, but shouldn't you
be on the toilet right now?
-What's wrong with you?
when I was lifting weights before.
And then I passed out...
and I haven't been able
to stand up since.
But I don't think
it's anything serious.
This sounds like a hernia.
this thing sticking out of my stomach!
That's a hernia.
Why'd I have to start
working out again?
Damn you, s!
What the hell are you doing?
Look, I was nervous.
You guys had me all worried
I was gonna be boring.
I got up there and they were
British accent just came out.
Yeah, and not a very good one.
Will you, please...?
Dr. Geller? Kurt Rathman.
I'm a paleontology professor here.
Do you have a moment
to talk about your lecture?
I'm sorry, I've got plans
with my sister.
Monica Geller.
Right. Will you excuse us
-You can have an accent, but I can't?
Top of the morning to you, laddies!
Would you just please stop?
Yes, yes, Bombay is very, very nice
this time of year.
Hey, will you grab me a cruller?
Sit down!
Will you go to the hospital?
Hernia operations cost...
a lot probably, okay?
Besides, it's getting darker and more
painful. That means it's healing.
Look, I'll loan you the money.
Just go to the hospital and
forever to pay you back.
I don't want that
hanging over my head.
Besides, when my
insurance kicks in...
I can get all the free
with that laser eye surgery.
What's going on?
Joey's got a hernia, but it's nothing
a little laser eye surgery won't fix.
I'm telling you,
if I put my hand on my stomach...
it doesn't hurt that bad.
Hey, maybe you'll die!
Chandler, I'm scared.
No, we can go together.
Just don't wait too long, because I'm
and haunt these guys!
Wait. Could I come back and haunt Monica
and Rachel when they're in the shower?
-That's my girlfriend.
-Hey, I'm dead!
-Give me them!
-You stole them from me!
Give me them!
Just wanna each take one?
Yeah, that seems fair.
We never use them.
Look, I really need
some help, okay?
Why did I have to speak
Mummy and Daddy?
I'm serious! Someone's gonna find out and
then they're never gonna offer me a job.
Why don't you phase it out?
Yeah, phase the accent out.
People will think you're
No one will even notice.
They're probably not even
listening to you.
They're not listening to me?
Of course they're listening to you.
Everybody listens to you.
Monica, do you think I should
try this phasing-out thing?
I think you look fine.
Whenever you're ready.
Hey, Timmy.
I've got a surprise...
for you.
Hold it.
If you could play it less intense.
Oh, yeah. Sure, no problem.
Just hold on one second.
Hey, Timmy.
I've got a surprise for you!
Oh, my God!
So that's why I feed my dog
Purina One.
Pick up a bag today.
-That's where you pick up the bag.
-Exactly.
The line is, "Pick up a bag,"
-Really? Really? Okay.
Hello, Ross? This is Dr. McNeely
from the Fake Accent University.
We'd like you
to come onboard full-time!
Listen to this!
My reading was wrong.
the cards wrong.
I'm sorry.
Better her than me.
Hey, let's bake cookies!
Listen, I'm really glad
you got the part.
Are you sure you can do this?
And thanks for coming with me.
And thanks again
for helping me take a shower.
Now, is that
He'll be playing your son.
Hi, Alex.
As you can see, my hands
are not in my pants.
All right, Alex.
Now, when Joey says his line...
"Take good care of your mama, son,"
supposed to cry.
Can you cry for us this time?
All right. From the top.
Scene five, take two.
Take  is up.
Let's try this again.
You ready, Joe?
One thing, is it all right
if I scream...
right up until
you say, "Action"?
Sure.
-Action!
shirt? Take a look at this, kiddo.
We have a crying child!
Roll the damn cameras!
-Hello, is Ross there?
-No, he's not. Can I take a message?
Yes, this is Russell,
assume he's giving the marriage a try.
Ross got married again?
All right, keep going.
We are phasing the accent out.
Phasing it out.
"So without retesting their results
in the laboratory...
the team would never
in their carbon dating...
analysis."
Were there any questions
at this point?
What's happening to your accent?
Come again? What's this nonsense?
All right. I'm not English.
I'm from Long lsland.
I was really nervous,
and the accent...
just came out.
I'm sorry.
So if we could just
a good first impression.
Obviously, I screwed up. But what
you guys think of me is important...
because I'm hoping to get
a permanent job here.
So if you'd just give me another
Were you just never gonna tell me?
What the hell is wrong with you?
I could just kill you!
Well, hello, Rachel!
You've really done this before?
You just take a big, big swing, okay?
Now, don't hold back.
What are you doing?
We're just celebrating that Joey
got his health insurance back.
Oh, all right.
See? Now let's try one without the helmet.
I cannot believe that you didn't
tell me we are still married!
Look, I was going to tell you.
When? After the birth
We are still married!
-You're kidding.
-Oh, my God!
It wasn't my best decision, but I
couldn't face another failed marriage.
At what point did you think
it's actually kind of funny.
Maybe it's best not to think about it.
This is inexcusable.
I'm shocked to my very core.
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Another lie. You have a sickness!
For my own peace of mind,
are you married to any more of us?
Look, Rach, I was going to tell you.
I just wanted to do it in my own way.
Yes, silently, with no words.
Look, in Ross' defense, okay....
The One With Joey's Porsche
Someone left their keys.
To a Porsche.
-Are these yours?
I saved up for  years.
Did anybody lose their keys?
Put them in the lost and found.
There's a lost and found?
My shoe!
You left a shoe here?
I didn't realize till I got home.
I wasn't gonna walk back with one shoe.
I'll go find that guy's car
and leave a note on the windshield.
When he comes back for his keys,
Listen.
How would you like to spend tomorrow
taking care of three cute puppies?
My God! What a fun day!
Sounds great!
Yeah, all right.
I'll bring them by tomorrow morning.
By the way, they're not
See you.
What?
Please, please, please?
Frank and Alice...
asked me to baby-sit them.
I'm nervous. I've never done that.
Don't worry. We'll do it.
I'm gonna pass, because I was
great practice for when...
people with babies come to visit.
So I still have boxes here.
I still have boxes at Ross'.
And I have nowhere to live.
I could so easily freak out right now.
What about me? Denise is leaving town
for a while. I don't have a roommate.
Well, maybe I could be
your roommate, Phoebe.
Maybe you could be my roommate!
Well, there's an idea!
That would be great!
-How long is Denise gone for?
My husband, the apple of my eye.
Okay, I got us a court date
for tomorrow at ...
and I picked up all the forms.
I'll take care of it.
Sure, if you say you'll take care
of it, I have no reason to doubt you.
Give me those forms.
I'm gonna do this my way and I
-You're peeping!
Ross, I just got..
-Why did you do this?
-I told you..
I don't wanna hear
"three failed marriages."
If you'd had two failed marriages,
I've ever been this angry!
What about when I said
we were on a break?
-Nice car.
-Yeah, it's not mine.
-I love your car.
-Me too. Yeah.
And comfortable.
-You like leather seats?
-Yeah.
It's got them!
Phoebe, how's it going?
I'm okay. Are they having fun?
Am I talking too fast?
No. You sound like me.
It's going great. Look at Chandler
I heard that before? Oh, Coach Rubin.
Phoebe, when you're done over there,
we've got a situation over here too.
No. We are all responsible
for our own babies.
That's where you're wrong.
a zone defense.
What do you mean?
Things'll go smoother if we each have a
zone. Phoebe, be in charge of wiping.
Mon, be in charge of diapering.
I'll be in charge of looking at how cute
they are when they put their hands...
Sounds great, but you should be
I should not be in the end zone.
This is so great. This is exactly how
we set the plates at the restaurant.
Yeah? Well, this is not
what I ordered.
Hey, guys.
Hey, babies.
I'm having the best morning.
That Porsche I've got the keys to?
still have the keys.
You should see the treatment I get
with that car.
People are friendly. They wanna talk.
And not just about the car.
One guy advised me
Will you keep up?
If people see me just standing there,
they're gonna think I don't own it.
So I figure I'll wash it.
Monica, you got a bucket and soap?
Oh, yeah. I got soap
and polishing compound.
You don't even have a car.
I know. Once there was a dirty car in
front of the building, so I washed it.
-And?
-And six others.
There you are.
Yeah, she tops out at .
That's just in the city.
-Okay. Take it easy.
Hey. That's my car.
Really?
Just give me five more minutes.
What are you doing?
I found the keys and now
I'm just polishing her up.
-But it's my car.
-Yeah, but it's my wax.
Listen, I don't come to the city much.
I don't know if you're crazy or
I'll save your parking spot.
I'm not coming back.
-Why not?
-I live upstate.
Yeah, so did I.
I don't know why I was so nervous...
and why Frank and Alice complain.
This is easy.
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime,
When the babies wake up...
they can meet Krog!
That thing could put
someone's eye out.
He can do more than that.
He can destroy the universe.
They could swallow
That's just gonna mess them up.
It's just not an appropriate toy
for -year-olds. Or -year-olds.
They won't swallow anything.
You're too overprotective.
When I was a kid, my mom used to throw
-Glass, sand, whatever.
Look at little Leslie stretching
in her sleep.
Oh, it's so cute.
I wonder when you stop putting
both legs behind your head.
I can still do that.
How are you still single?
I thought about it and maybe you're
-I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.
How did that happen?
I was trying to prove
that I was right.
And it turns out I was wrong...
and now it's lodged in my throat.
This whole time we were
concentrating on the babies...
and no one was watching Chandler!
You are asking the court
our forms, all filled out.
So based on your petition...
you are seeking an annulment
on the grounds...
that "Mr. Geller
is mentally unstable."
Fine. I'm mentally unstable.
And based on the fact that "Mr. Geller
-Yes. Heroin and crack.
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.
Well, you would know.
Now, it also says here that you...
"lied about your sexual preference
before marriage."
Oh, come on.
Ross, please. I found the magazines.
And finally, that you were
"unable to consummate the marriage."
Well, that makes sense since
I'm not gay and there is no problem...
with my ability
to consummate anything.
I'll consummate this marriage
right here, right now!
That won't be necessary.
And when we were dating,
relationship, that creates a problem.
Rest assured, that relationship
ended two years ago.
Strike "consummated like bunnies"
from the record.
Is there anything in this record
the legal system works.
This process is based on an objective
review of the facts, not of the lies.
Objection!
-It doesn't work like that either.
-Overruled.
Oh, stop it.
Based on what I've heard, you certainly
file for divorce.
That's great. You happy? Look what
you did with your funny, funny form.
What? Me? What about you and your
"consummated like bunnies" nonsense?
What are you typing that for?
keeping me married to?
Get out of my chambers.
Lady, here's the deal.
I came here for an annulment and
I'm not leaving here until I get one!
-Would you like a night in jail?
-Thank you for your time.
That Porsche guy took his car back.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
No, I just love the way it feels
because of the clothes?
Of course.
Only an idiot would wear this stuff
if he didn't have the car.
That is true.
Yeah, but only a genius would
swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Oh, I've been there.
I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
You know you don't actually have one.
What are you doing? I'm in character.
It's poking me.
We'll go to the emergency room.
No, you can't leave me here with them.
We're babysitting.
The babies are asleep.
You'll be okay on your own.
You can't leave me with them.
They'll triple-team me!
He's got plastic in his throat.
We gotta go to the hospital.
But a doctor won't be able to help him.
And it's just gonna...
naturally pass through
-I'm pretty sure it's gun.
This really hurts. Let's go.
But no! A real man wouldn't
just run to the hospital.
No! What would Krog do?
Why isn't that valet back
with my Porsche?
Maybe because you've got the keys?
-That was totally your fault.
of the court reporter's machine!
That was the only way I could
get him to stop typing!
Hi. How are the Gellers?
Don't call us that.
The judge wouldn't let us get an
annulment. Now we gotta get a divorce!
Did a Porsche throw up on you?
It's "Porsche-a"!
Me taking care of you
as a "Yeah, I do!"
Let's get rid of this dirty diaper.
I'll set you up with a clean one.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
I just have to clean that up.
Because, let's face it,
Well, that's just the way things go.
Okay. Good.
Why are there only two of you?
Where's Leslie?
Well, you can't answer.
Leslie? Where are you, Leslie?
Now would be a good time
for your first words.
Well, look at you!
You are a little bit mischievous.
and sister now...
who aren't there.
How do you feel?
Let's just say Krog will be equipped
to destroy the universe again...
in  to  hours.
I totally took care of the babies
all by myself.
I fed them, bathed them
of the babies all by myself.
-But my apartment!
-Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
But the mess!
Is not as important as the fact
that Phoebe took care of the babies.
You're right. I shouldn't freak out.
This is what it'll be like
I was getting worried.
I picked up the divorce papers.
I've already signed everything.
I put little X's where you need to sign.
Little X's. Great!
That makes up for everything.
You know, you've done
as stupid as this one.
How about you flew to London
to stop my wedding?
You told me you loved me
after I was married.
Wait, that was different. I did those
this whole marriage thing.
Kind of my idea.
Excuse me?
Remember how we were too drunk to
remember anything when we were married?
I didn't really wanna say anything,
but it just kept coming back to me.
We were in the casino and you thought
if we got married.
So as a compromise we decided
first to get married and then...
to eat a lot of grapes.
Sorry I got us into this whole thing.
So then if you think about it...
this is all your fault.
Yeah, don't push it, though.
I gotta say...
I know I divorce a lot of women.
Never thought I'd be divorcing you.
I know.
I always thought if we got married,
that'd be the one that stuck.
And it wouldn't be a secret...
and we wouldn't have our
It was a newlywed special.
That may be the most depressing thing
I've heard.
I should get these
to my lawyer's office.
Thanks for taking care of all this.
No problem.
-I'm gonna need a copy of those.
under there.
I'd show you, but I just tucked
her in. She's sleeping.
Would you like to go for a drink?
I'm moving out, so you're
in charge of paying the rent.
-When's it due?
you want to live here.
Okay, here's the phone bill.
Oh, my God!
That's our phone number.
I know I kind of sprung this
me-moving-out-on-you thing.
-Why don't I cover you for a while?
-No way!
Joey Tribbiani does not
-Forget it.
Thanks, but I'm done
taking money from you.
I can take care of myself.
What's next? Come on.
Here's the electric bill.
-This is how much we pay for electric?
the rest of the bills later, then?
The One On The Last Night
Will Joey have to give up
the apartment?
I offered him money,
but he wouldn't take it.
How much does he need?
$ would cover him
taking it so I don't hurt his pride.
Why don't you hire him as an actor?
You could have him dress up
and put on skits whenever you want.
Well, that would help the pride thing.
Wow, you look great! Do you wanna
move in with me tomorrow?
Any plans for tonight?
Instead of being sad on my
Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.
-And also my birthday.
-It's not your birthday.
What a mean thing to say! I'd never
tell you it wasn't your birthday.
You guys have anything planned
we figure we'd do nothing.
Knicks' season opener tonight.
I thought you'd come and watch it.
I don't know, Ross.
Not if you talk about how you gave up
basketball to become a paleontologist.
I did give up a career in basketball
-You're not dressed yet?
We're supposed to start having fun
in  minutes!
And clearly, not a minute sooner.
You are packed, though, right?
Please tell me you're packed?
Of course I'm packed.
what I should wear.
My God, I can't get a minute of peace.
Oh, my God!
Monica's just gonna kill you.
I know.
What you're wearing is fine
for that.
You're not packed!
You're not packed even a little bit!
Surprise!
Don't get mad,
because this is what happened.
I started packing,
on our last night....
I'll be coordinator!
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I didn't get you anything.
Everybody has to help.
Phoebe, can you help?
I have plans.
-You have plans with us.
wrap and Joey can lift.
Tell the guys
they have to help out.
My God, thank you!
Monica's gonna make you pack!
She's got jobs for everyone!
Now, it's too late for me,
Rachel hasn't packed.
Now, everybody has to help.
Chandler..
I have plans with Joey.
-You said you were doing nothing.
-Yes, but for the last time.
Fine. Now, Ross..
-I can't do it.
-Because I have Ben!
It's almost past his bedtime.
Where is he?
He's at a dinner party.
He's really coming?
I can see in your apartment.
Of course he is. What?
You think I'd use my son as an excuse?
What kind of father do you think I am?
All right. Sorry.
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Here it is.
Our last pizzas together as roommates.
I wish I knew that.
You know?
Our last dinner together. Me,
bringing the food of my ancestors...
you, the food of yours!
I had an idea for what to do
on our last night.
What do you say we play a little
since my injury-plagued ' season.
-It'd be easier to give me your money.
-Yes, it would.
What do you say to $?
" dollars, you are more than I have."
If you know that you'll win,
-Okay, let's play.
The big game. Italy versus...
China, apparently.
Look, it's the Rollerblades.
Oh, God!
You remember when we got these?
I guess you weren't there.
You guys,
we said we were gonna have fun.
Come on. Hey, remember the time....
You don't remember?
Sorry, Phoebe. I'm just really sad
that I'm leaving.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
This doesn't have to be so sad,
how you'll miss each other...
you should think of the things
you're not gonna miss.
I don't think there's anything.
Come on, there's gotta be something.
She's perfect.
I have one.
Okay, you can go first.
I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact...
that you're never allowed
to move the phone pen.
That's a good one.
does Rachel move the phone pen?
Sometimes.
Always, actually.
There you go.
Doesn't everyone feel better?
Not just the phone pen.
I never get my messages.
You get your messages.
It doesn't count if you have to
read them off your hand...
after you've fallen asleep
Chandler?
Or your mom?
Or Chandler?
Or your mom?
It worked! No one's sad!
I win again!
That's, like,  bucks
you owe me!
Man! Five hundred dollars.
That is a lot of electricity, huh?
I gotta buy some food.
Give me a chance to win my money back.
Sudden death...
one goal, $.
-You serious?
are supposed to do the kicking.
Hi, Ross.
See, other people call me!
Oh, your brother. Score!
What's up?
I'm here with Ben.
Thought we'd say hi.
-Put him on.
-Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.
I guess he doesn't feel like
a basketball player.
I think it was better
when you guys were sad.
Hey, remember the Rollerblades?
You know what else I won't miss?
"I'm Monica.
I wash the toilets  times a day,
Is my sweater too tight?
I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
"I'm Monica. I never get messages
from interesting people."
I call her.
"Oh, my God! I love Ross. I hate
Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross!"
"My God!
with the first guy I find there!"
You guys, come on,
this is the last night!
Yeah, you're right, and so for the last time
I would like to ask you:
Boo-hoo. Get out of my room!
We should get a move on if we want
most important things
The foosball table...
and $.
There are other ways to win back
your money. How about blackjack?
Not my game.
You know what?
We can play a new game.
-It's fun!
-I'll teach you. It's easy and fun.
-All right.
-Here you go.
I have two queens.
What do you have?
-A  and a .
-Let's play again.
-What have you got?
- and a .
You're kidding, right?
-No. Why?
-That's a full cup!
Damn, I am good at Cups!
I'm not talking to her.
You have to take the first step...
because she's the one who's
I can hear her.
She's not crying.
She's holding it in.
She's so brave. Go.
I feel bad about what happened..
-What are you doing?
-I'm unpacking.
I'm not moving.
to the left.
You're the one who wants this
big change and to move in with Chandler!
You should go!
Why do I have to leave?
-It's my apartment!
-Great. Monica's moving.
I am not!
Really? How come all your
stuff is in this box?
Okay, you guys,
I think I know what's going on here!
You guys? Stop!
I know you're acting mad because
Deep, deep down.
-No, Phoebe, I am mad!
-Well, deep down!
I'm just mad.
Then keep running.
You win!
-What did you have?
-Nothing beats...
a three and a six.
That, my friend, is "D Cup."
How much have you won so far?
-.
you have to double it.
I didn't make up the rules.
Now, after you receive the doubling
bonus, you get one card.
That one card could be worth $,
which brings your total to $.
Don't get excited, that won't happen
"What were you thinking?"
I was just gonna go across
the hall and write that on Chandler.
Guys, I don't wanna make
things worse, but...
I don't wanna live with
with Rachel. I still like you.
That's fine because I'm not moving.
Phoebe, you gotta take her.
I said some bad stuff...
but Rachel has qualities
that make her a good roommate.
Like what, Monica?
She has , pair of boots.
Good start, Mon.
She lets you borrow them.
And you stretch them out
with your big old clown feet.
Do you wanna live outside?
down the pages of things I'd like.
What else?
When I take a shower...
she leaves me notes on the mirror.
I do. I do do that.
That's nice. I like having things
to read in the bathroom.
When I fall asleep on the couch...
she covers me with a blanket.
Well, you know,
I don't want you to be cold.
And when I told her I was gonna
We'll have so much fun!
I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Oh, that's right.
You're still set on that?
Kind of.
Oh, my God!
How's the packing going?
Ben? He's fine. He's right..
Oh, my God!
Get your head out of your shirt
-Ross and I were helping pack...
took a little break.
I lost $ to him in Cups!
How did you lose at Cups?
The same way you lost!
I started out with the king and the
queen. Bam! Ross gets a  and a .
Then I get a jack and a king.
the D Cup...
the sitting-down bonus. I didn't
even get half a cup! Nothing!
Oh, man!
He never played before either.
I think beginner's luck
is very important in Cups!
Let's play one more hand.
I'm serious this time.
In fact, look.
I wanna give you something.
Let me give it to you before
I pawn it for Cups money.
I want you to have
the big, white dog...
as a thank-you for being
You love it.
It's "him." Not "it."
What if I bought it from you?
Then your nice gesture would be
giving it to me at a reasonable price.
Say $?
Wait a second.
I see what you're trying to do here.
You're trying to give me money again!
When did I try to give you money?
Over there with the bills!
You tried to give me charity,
tried to give anybody any money.
Now you start with the
charity thing again!
I'm trying to help you out.
I wanna make sure that you're okay.
I will be okay.
You gotta get it out of your head
out with money.
The only thing I'm gonna miss...
is you.
And now the dog.
-Call me when you get there, okay?
-Okay.
I'm really gonna miss you.
I have your key.
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
God, this is silly.
-I know.
-Thank you.
-No problem, roomie.
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.
What the hell is that dog doing here?
I invented the game of Cups
-Exactly.
What kind of idiot do you
take me for?
It's not a real game.
I made it up.
I'm sorry you lost your money.
make some of it back...
I'd be glad to play you for it.
But I should warn you.
I am very good at Cups.
I assume the saucer card
came up when you played last.
Let's see if it comes up this time.
Ready?
Hi, it's Rachel and Phoebe's.
-Leave.
But I just said "leave."
I know because you have
all the good words.
What do I get? I get "it's," "and."
Oh, I'm sorry, I have "a." Forget it.
-That's silly.
We can switch.
- Hi...
-everybody...
-It's...
-Rachel...
-and...
are you?
This is gonna be interesting.
Can we finish this later?
I'm going running before it gets dark.
-Why don't you come with me?
-Really?
It'll be fun! We'll run in the park.
-Let's run towards them!
Wait just one more second.
Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's.
Please leave a message. Thanks!
Wait a minute.
You took all the words!
You've met your match, Rachel Greene!
The One Where Phoebe Runs
I just finished this
there'll be computers...
that can carry out the same amount
of functions as a human brain.
So, theoretically,
you could download...
your thoughts and memories
with my eyes open.
Honey, it was a great idea,
nailing the boxes to the floor.
-I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
-So you can move them!
And while I'm doing that, Ross has
I'd like you to meet Janine.
She's gonna be my new roommate!
And she's gonna live with me!
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Le Croix.
I didn't know that.
What a pretty last name.
So where are you from?
Australia.
I just moved here.
From the land down under?
I didn't know that either!
So what do you do?
-I'm a dancer.
before you asked her to move in?
Of course!
What did you ask her?
When can you move in?
Thank you for bringing her
into our lives.
Unbelievable.
Down, boy.
Oh, no, no, no. She's not my type.
Not for me, she's not my type. She's too..
Beautiful, tall, sexy,
You can't. She's your roommate.
It'll be too complicated.
Yeah, don't do it.
I mean, if you date her,
then I can't date her.
What if you started going out with her
and it didn't work out?
That's when I make my move.
Remember when you broke up
bumped into her at the supermarket?
Oh, God, yeah.
Now imagine you live
at the supermarket.
Okay!
You're right! I don't want that.
I can't date her.
You'd better watch the flirting too,
an attractive woman and not flirt.
You're around me all the time,
and you don't flirt.
A little sad about that, sweetie?
I have to tie my shoes, so you
go ahead. I'll catch up.
Come on, that's not running!
every night before she went to bed.
I used to do that too!
Did you also have his album,
"It's Not Easy Being Green"?
Oh, Mon.
So Phoebe runs weird, huh?
Yeah. And I know she'll
want to run again.
I don't know how to get out of it.
Tell her the truth.
You're right.
I should just tell her the truth.
Phoebe, Monica tripped me. I don't
think I can ever run again, ever!
But we were having so much fun.
-We'll see.
Okay. I am officially unpacked.
Thanks for helping me, man.
Joe?
Well, I guess Joey went home.
And look, there is still one box
I have to unpack.
I got you!
Oh, my God, you almost gave me
a heart attack.
It was so hard not to laugh.
Hey, the place looks great.
Not bad, right?
Monica's working late,
and get her some flowers.
Who wouldn't want to live with me?
I don't.
No, I want to live with
the super-hot Australian dancer!
How's that going? Are you okay
with the not-flirting thing?
So far. But it's tough.
I've got this built-up flirting energy,
more room out here.
No, you just reminded me
that I have to do my stretches too.
Why don't you try to be...?
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.
I didn't want you to touch me...
because I'm all sweaty
hanging in there.
It's just my thongs are
too delicate for the dryer.
Oh, yeah, it's me.
I saw you grab your running shoes
this morning and sneak out.
You lied so you could run by yourself.
No, Phoebe, no. I was....
I was actually just checking...
to see...
if I could run. And I can!
Please, I'm not an idiot.
No, wait. Phoebe?
Wow. Couples who live together
have to say and leave me alone!
Sound alike too.
So, Mondler....
What are you doing?
What does it look like?
I am cleaning.
Did you get Monica's authorization
to move all her stuff?
I don't need that.
where you found it?
Yes. I'm gonna put it back
exactly where I found it.
First of all,
that attitude is not helping.
She won't care if I put her stuff
that I did a nice thing...
and appreciate it.
Actually, this will work out well.
Because when you move back
with Joey...
Joey's hot new roommate
can come live with me.
Oh, I see. You're trying
about this kind of stuff, all right?
Believe me, I lived with her for
 years. She's going to freak out.
Oh, my God.
She's going to sit on you.
That probably won't hurt as much anymore.
No, she is not.
-Terrible.
If I want something done right,
I have to do it myself.
Other people just wreck stuff.
I think I might kill someone tonight.
Come on, it can't be that bad.
The only thing getting me through...
is knowing I'll see you soon.
I might even try
to get out of here early.
It sounds like they need you there.
-You're just hanging out with Ross?
We should start with the big stuff.
That'll be the easiest.
Let's start with the couch.
I got it.
That doesn't look right.
What are you talking about?
The couch is in line with the carpet.
Then I can just walk over here
closer to the coffee table.
But then the back of the couch
won't line up with the carpet.
Well, we'll just move
the coffee table...
closer to the couch.
But then the coffee table
match the table!
Look, what am I gonna do?
I'm not flirting, but I'm drawing
her to me like a moth to a flame!
What the hell's going on over here?
Monica's gonna kill you!
I need your help.
I have to do something
to repel this woman.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You guys repel women all the time!
Hey, I've been married three times.
No, I've seen it happen.
You get a rapport going with a woman,
you liked and talked...
about the lrish potato famine?
What about you?
You weren't so hot either.
After everything he said,
he'd go..
Monica doesn't like that either.
I start talking about science.
That's not specific to girls.
This is great. What else?
They don't like you correcting
their grammar.
And they don't like it when you
explain why your jokes are funny.
They don't like it when you
-I'm never gonna find love again.
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.
Phoebe, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, okay?
I handled the situation horribly.
And I should not have lied to you.
So what should you have done?
I should have told you the truth.
Which is?
Well, the reason I didn't
is just a little....
-So?
-It's embarrassing.
People were looking at us
like we were crazy.
-Why do you care?
and will never see again.
Yes, but still they are people...
with eyes.
I didn't get embarrassed
running next to Miss....
But okay.
I can see why running with me
would be embarrassing to you.
Okay. You're uptight.
What? I am not uptight.
I am not uptight, man.
That's okay. I'm not judging you.
I run like I did when I was a kid...
because that's the only way
it's fun, you know?
Didn't you ever run so fast
you thought your legs would fall off...
Like when you were running towards
because she's allowed to see me naked.
Why does anyone have to be naked?
Why is Ross naked?
I had to show Chandler something.
Naked?
I guess I have...
a "guy" problem.
Is it the same thing
Chandler had?
We'll get everything squared away,
and you can come back later!
There's still some of Chandler's
-Bye!
Thank God.
Dude, what'd you have?
We have no time, okay?
We must focus.
We've got to get everything
back into its original place.
The photo album!
There were millions of pictures
to the pictures!
That's perfect! That's brilliant!
What'd you have?
I've got some beer for you.
Don't you mean "for whom"?
Sure.
I was gonna order some pizza.
You wanna share one?
Pizza? It's not like I never
had that before.
Is something wrong?
Yeah. I'm depressed about that
to be acting really weird around me.
All right, all right.
Let's just get this
out in the open, okay?
You're hot.
I'm lovable.
Clearly, there's a vibe
going on between us.
But we're roommates...
and it's a huge mistake
what do we do?
There isn't anything to do.
I think you're really sweet.
But I'm not interested
in you like that.
No, I mean....
You're a nice guy, and I'm happy
to be your roommate and your friend.
I'm just, you know, I just...
don't feel that way about you.
I see what happened.
It's because I was trying
a lot different if I turned it on.
-I don't think so.
-Oh, I do.
How you doing?
I'm okay.
What?
What?
Oh, dear God!
I'm so sorry. You're right.
This feels great!
And you don't care if people stare.
I feel so free and so graceful!
Watch out for the horse.
Can I come in now?
-Why is everything different?
-Bye.
I don't see anything different...
other than the fact that the room
got brighter when you came into it.
The end table is wrong,
on the refrigerator magnets.
Okay, don't be mad, okay?
After I unpacked the boxes, I wanted
to do something nice for you...
so I cleaned the apartment.
So I moved everything around,
and then I forgot...
where it went back.
is a wonderful thing...
and I really appreciate it.
I have this thing where I want
everything in the perfect place.
But I'd never expect you
to worry about that.
Really?
Of course.
Oh, you're the best.
You come here to me.
Hold on, okay?
while he was naked?
It said that by the year ...
there'll be computers carrying
out the same number of functions...
as an actual human brain.
So, theoretically, you could
download your thoughts...
and your memories
what we're doing right now?
You and I, we're interfacing.
I gotta go.
Hi, my name's Chandler.
I just moved in next door.
Would you like to battle me
in a post-apocalyptic world...
for control of the galaxy's
She gets really mad.
Oh, my God!
It's like a guy never lived in here.
You gotta be careful. This girl
thing is dangerous. It's spreading.
It is?
Is this your pretty pink pillow
on the couch?
Is that your tiny little box that's
You are a guy, okay?
This is a "guy's" place.
Soon, you'll be soaking
your fingers in stuff.
And your head's gonna be under a big,
brown, drying, big, drying.. It's not good.
-You're right. I'll talk to her.
-Defend yourself!
We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Be right there, sweetums.
Totally different situation.
The One With Ross' Teeth
Hey, guys.
-How was breakfast with Hillary?
-Okay.
She's still depressed because
she broke up with her boyfriend.
Is this Hillary, your
when I come in?
The one who looked at you once
because you got in her way.
Still, I could tell. She was into me.
Why don't you set us up?
Are you setting Ross up with someone?
Does she have a wedding dress?
Come on, I'm serious.
Okay, I'll do it, but as long as
What if she's the one?
Man, you have a problem.
Rachel?
I'm making up flyers to try
to get new massage clients.
Can I come to Bloomingdale's
and use the copier?
Sure, but they might think it's weird
where I actually work.
But come by at lunch
so my boss doesn't see you.
Kim will freak out.
She doesn't like me.
-I don't think my boss likes me.
around here at  on a Wednesday.
Let's head off to work.
-Thank you.
-Sure.
You will not believe this.
I was making copies,
and Ralph Lauren came in.
Oh, my God. Did you talk to him?
A little. He seems really nice.
-Good kisser.
-Totally.
Phoebe, are you serious?
He came in and introduced himself.
The next thing I know,
we're making out!
Phoebe, you do know he's married?
Phoebe.
I'm supposed to ask every guy
I make out with if he's married?
No, yeah, I should.
Hey, Joey.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Is it a relative?
No. I just thought it was cute.
That's what I was afraid of. Okay....
I really want you to feel
at home here, but...
some of this new stuff,
it's too girlie.
Like what?
Like this.
She's a famous artist.
I don't know this baby. I don't know
if she's a famous artist or not.
I don't want to be a jerk, but
you're changing too much around here.
I'm sorry. I wanted to make
the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.
Over here, you got
a picture of a watering can.
I just thought..
I'm sure it's a famous watering can.
But come on.
And what is with the really hot stick
in the bathroom?
It's a curling iron.
Well, that's okay then.
Okay, my towels, for instance.
where I keep it.
It's up here on some hook.
And it smells different.
-It's clean.
-It feels different.
It's dry.
All right, I can make my peace
these chips you bought?
It's potpourri.
You're supposed to smell it.
Well, that's like summer in a bowl.
Kim, hi.
I handed in that marketing report, and
I never got to hear what you thought.
I didn't read it.
The spring line's really gonna be
with someone in the copy room.
Tell me everything.
Hey, guys.
What's up?
You know....
Oh, my God.
What happened to your teeth?
I whitened them.
Really?
What do you think?
I think I shouldn't look
directly at them.
Come on, seriously.
-They're really, really, really white.
-What was wrong with your old...
human teeth?
I did leave the gel on
-A day.
Tonight is your date with Hillary.
I know. That's why I did it.
Are they really that bad?
You'll be fine.
Hillary's blind, right?
She will be after tonight.
Oh, Rach.
Yes, I saw them from outside.
You guys are never gonna
believe this...
but Phoebe made out
with Ralph Lauren.
-What?
and they just made out.
The craziest thing is,
now my boss likes me because...
it's the best gossip
she's heard all year.
I am proud of all my friends today.
I can't believe Phoebe made out
your live-in boyfriend.
Chandler, please. Come on.
Look at him.
Well, I am no woman,
but that is one tasty dish.
Here.
Who's the silver fox?
That is your make-out buddy.
Don't you recognize him?
Oh, wait.
"Phoebe, I love you.
It sounds like him, though.
-What?
-Ralph doesn't look like that guy.
He's young, and he's got long hair
and a beard and a Hacky Sack..
Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren.
made out with Ralph Lauren.
If she finds out that I lied to her,
she'll hate me even more. Phoebe!
Why would the copy guy say
he's Ralph Lauren?
To get you to make out with him!
This will make them look less white.
Nope.
Colors that don't work are...
blue, yellow, green, red, black,
What am I'm gonna do?
Maybe if your skin was lighter,
your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
Oh, great! So all I need to do
is get some new skin. Thank you.
If we put just a little bit
that has a shot at working.
Won't she notice I have makeup on?
Half the guys out there
have makeup on.
What?
Half the people.. I mean..
Just try it and see.
I am not putting on makeup.
Hello? Ross, could you put up
we didn't waste these pantyhose.
God forbid we throw out old underwear.
You know what?
I'm gonna go over to Joey's.
We've got to organize
the wrapping paper.
I've really gotten in touch with
from becoming a lesbian couple.
This has been a girlie day.
You're right. I'm sorry.
I just feel like I need
to be in a "guy" place...
do kind of a "man" thing.
You go over to Joey's and...
drink some beer and
drink beer and hammer up dry wall.
When girls hang out, we don't have
pillow fights in our underwear.
I'm sorry. We do.
I don't know why I said that.
Hey, Chandler.
Come on in.
We're knitting potholders.
No, thanks, Josephine.
Ross, I was wondering if..
Oh, my God! Where are all the men?
-Hi, Kim.
Well, it didn't happen.
You didn't cancel the fabric order?
Okay, two things didn't happen.
Remember I told you someone
made out with Ralph Lauren?
Well, it turns out that's not true.
It's not true?
That's interesting.
Because I checked. Only one keycard
that keycard belonged to you.
You think I made out with him?
Listen to me...
sleeping with Ralph is not
gonna get you my job.
I don't want your job. I don't.
This is a mistake.
I didn't make out with him.
Nobody made out with him.
how to use my keycard.
-Hi, Ralph.
-Hi, Kim.
Yeah. Nothing happened.
You could cut the sexual tension
in here with a knife.
After that, what could I do
my own restaurant.
You're a really great listener.
Most guys I go out with,
they talk and talk.
It's like, "Shut your mouth."
You know?
I've been talking too much.
and in my spare time...
I like to read spy novels.
But let's talk more about you.
If you sear the stems of the flowers
first in a frying pan...
your arrangement will
to the girl with the flowers.
Okay, but I'm gonna teach you
how to make a bird feeder...
out of a pine cone
and some peanut butter.
I love birds.
What is the matter with you?
-What?
dressed like flowers!
This is not Joey!
Look, I am still Joey, okay?
Flowers, they're just nice to look at.
And that happens to be a picture
by a famous artist of a famous baby.
You're turning into a woman.
No, I'm not.
Why would you say that?
That's just mean.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
It's not what you said.
with him to get her job.
-Why didn't you just tell the truth?
-I did.
She doesn't think anyone would confuse
Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
What if Kenny were the real brains
to be the pretty front man, huh?
Did she ever think of that?
You were with Kenny today.
Just for a second.
Phoebe, what am I gonna do?
The only thing you can do.
Sleep with him.
I'm not gonna sleep with him.
I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Sleep with Kenny.
-That wouldn't help me.
this much on the first date.
Me neither.
I've had a really
good time too, you know.
Are you gonna eat that bread?
I just like the smell.
You make me laugh.
Would you like to move to the couch?
Maybe I'll just turn down
the lights a little?
How about all the way?
Okay.
Wow, cool poster.
Or should I say, "groovy poster"?
So...
where were we?
Are those your teeth?
You can see them, huh?
Yes. They're insanely white.
I did that for you.
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with me?
you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?
What am I thinking?
Of course you have.
Okay, look.
I'm sorry that I lied to you before.
You were right. Ralph and I were
an item, but we're not anymore.
Oh, really?
Yeah, he dumped me.
He said, "Rachel, I can't do this.
Even though you're a very, very...
very beautiful woman...
I can't do this.
"And you will never get promoted...
especially not above Kim,
who is an integral cog...
in the Ralph Lauren machine."
You expect me to believe..
-Hi, Ralph.
-Hi, Kim.
Oh, my God.
He gave you the coldest look I've
And it hurts so bad.
Oh, honey, come here.
Oh, it'll be okay.
We've all been there.
You and Ralph?
Kenny the copy boy.
-I need to talk to you.
-What's the matter? You upset?
Would you like me to get
a pint of ice cream and two spoons?
No, no, no ice cream. Look....
We gotta get rid of all
remain a guy place, okay?
That's the way it has to be.
I'll just put it all in my room.
Good. Great.
Thanks for being so understanding.
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of this.
But you could put the picture
of the famous baby in my room.
I mean, if you want to.
Okay.
And maybe the watering can there.
Sure.
And a couple of these
it all in your room?
Okay.
Hey, you guys ever wonder
why they call it "Thanksgiving"?
Okay. Hey, Monica, you're doing
Thanksgiving next week, right?
Because Carol's taking Ben
I'll make Thanksgiving dinner.
You don't have to beg.
I didn't beg.
I just asked once.
You could beg, you know.
Monica said
I could make dessert this year.
-You're gonna cook something?
you could cook this year?
I remember her saying in two years.
You said in two years, right?
No, I promised her.
Are you sure you want to start out with
something as big as Thanksgiving dinner?
I mean, maybe you wanna try
I can do this.
Remember, I made those
peanut butter cookies.
What are you guys so worried about?
Cooking is easy.
You just follow the recipe.
If it says, "boil two cups of salt,"
to Thanksgiving dinner?
Sidney Poitier?
I miss Rachel.
My parents.
Great, they haven't seen the place
since I moved in.
If you could not mention that
we live together, that'd be great.
I was thinking we'd eat around .
Why can't I tell them
Should we eat in the kitchen?
Why haven't you told them?
Well, I was going to. I really was.
But then somewhere,
just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Why not? Wouldn't they be happy?
So, dinner in the kitchen around .
I'll see you then.
Why wouldn't they be happy?
Well, because...
mainly...
they don't like you.
-I'm sorry.
or that you joke around...
or that you throw your clothes
on the couch.
Is this why they don't like me
or you don't like me?
I know I should have told them.
they come over, I will be charming.
I will make them love me,
then we'll tell them.
Will that work?
I can be pretty charming, babe.
I won you over, didn't l?
I don't think you'll ever get
Your parents like me, right?
Yes, of course they like you.
Monica told me they don't.
Yeah, they don't like you.
Do you know why?
Maybe it's because you're sarcastic
or maybe it's because you..
If people don't know,
they shouldn't just guess!
Another Thanksgiving
for you shutting up, huh?
Maybe I give thanks by taking
my PlayStation to my place.
Maybe I love you.
Hey, guys.
No, I don't want
to play video games, Joey!
Are you guys going
doing Thanksgiving uptown.
I thought you might like to come.
For real?
You should go to Chandler's.
None of us can cook.
We'll just drink all day.
We go to yours!
We have to stop across the hall
because it's my sister.
But, you know, actually,
understand women.
Yeah, you should tell
your friends that.
Okay.
How you got three women to marry you,
I'll never know.
Hey, Mon, look.
the cooking skills of a hot day.
Phoebe, check it out!
For my dessert...
I'm making a traditional
English trifle.
Wow. That sounds great!
so good that I eat all of it...
and there's none left
for anybody else!
Nothing.
Nothing?
No, sweetie. I trust you.
If I mess this up,
there's nothing else for dessert?
You won't mess it up.
I love that. You really
when the butter is done?
It's done about two minutes
before it looks like that.
-The food smells great, Mon.
-And the place looks so nice.
-Hey, happy Thanksgiving, everybody!
-See you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where you going?
We did say we'd stop by this little
thing Joey's roommate is having.
Oh, Janine,
the really hot dancer girl?
Some would say she's attractive, yes.
Who else is going to be there?
Her friends.
Her dancer friends?
Yes! All right?
All of her hot dancer friends
and we really want to go!
Dude, we were good.
You're not going. You said
you'd eat here and you'll eat here.
Yeah, and leaving us
to go see hot dancer girls...
is not very Thanksgiving-y.
Oh, but it is.
It's like the first Thanksgiving when
the Pilgrims...
...what it meant to be hot
in the New World!
Fellas, I really think
you should stay here.
You're just jealous
-Hi!
Hi, Dad. Mom.
Look! Look who it is!
It's Chandler!
Oh, yes, of course.
Hello, Chandler.
Mr. and Mrs. Geller,
Let us take your coats.
Whoa, it snowing out there?
No.
Monica, all this food looks wonderful.
You should do this for a living.
Okay, I have dandruff.
There's no need to laugh and point.
Chandler was laughing at your joke.
My joke wasn't funny.
Chandler laughs at everything.
That's one of the great things about him.
Rach, I just remembered.
I had a dream
about Mr. Geller last night.
Really?
I dreamt that he saved me
totally differently.
He used to be just
"Jack Geller, Monica and Ross' dad."
Now he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
I don't know. To me,
he'll always be "Jack Geller...
walks in while you're changing."
You know, Dad, Chandler is one
how a man turns out...
is a reflection on his father.
I always thought that too.
Tell me, what does your father do?
He's a headliner of a...
gay burlesque show.
You're killing us.
Will you serve the dessert already?
There's drunken dancers a-waiting!
Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?
Yeah. What is it?
It's a trifle.
of ladyfingers, then jam...
then custard,
which I made from scratch...
then raspberries,
more ladyfingers...
then beef sauteed
I put whipped cream on top.
What was the one right before bananas?
The beef.
Yeah, that was weird to me too.
But then I thought,
"Well, there's minced-meat pie."
That's an English dessert.
These people just put
don't you sneak a taste.
Beef in a dessert?
No, no, no. There is no way.
I know. And only one layer of jam?
What is up with that?
Oh, my God.
The pages are stuck together.
Chandler!
Oh, my God. She made
half an English trifle and...
half a shepherd's pie!
Man, now she's gonna start all over.
We're never gonna get to introduce
the hot girls to the New World.
No, no, we will.
the beef-custard thing?
Yeah. It'll be like
a funny Thanksgiving story.
Vomiting stories are funny, I guess.
Joey. God, your
apartment is, like,  degrees.
Did it make you want
to be that can of condensed milk.
Chandler was just saying
how beautiful your sweater is.
Thank you. I just bought it.
Yes, well, it's very beautiful and
it's cream-colored and tight and...
I don't mean tight. It's not tight.
my parents don't like you.
Why?
Okay, remember we were young.
Spring break, sophomore year,
I got high in my bedroom...
and my parents walked in
and smelled it...
so I told them that you had gotten
name that popped into my head.
I didn't think it'd matter.
How could it not matter?
How was I to know
we'd be friends after college...
and you'd be living with my sister?
What about the
"friends forever" stuff?
I don't know. I was all high.
Mom and Dad sent me to find out
in college, and he blamed it on me!
I can't believe you!
We haven't told them we're together
because they hate me, so fix this.
Okay, okay, I'll tell them
it wasn't Chandler who got high.
Now, who should I say it was?
You! It's not like it's a big deal.
tricked me into doing it?
Nobody. You're gonna go out there
and tell them exactly what happened.
-Really?
-Yes!
Okay.
Wait, is there anything else
of my dad's records.
Why?
Evidently, you weren't very good
at handling your high.
Dad, please don't pick
your teeth out here.
And if you're gonna put your feet up..
Leave him alone!
Will you hurry up?
Did you not hear me when I told you
be drinking a lot?
No, I did. But tell me again
because it's so romantic.
You're whipping so slow.
Do it faster!
I don't want to make any mistakes!
If I screw it up,
when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
Just let me worry about making it,
and you just worry about eating it.
Oh, I am.
-If you don't tell them, then I will.
-Okay. Fine.
Ross, can I talk to you for a second?
Can it wait? I have
she messed up her dessert.
What? What is with everybody?
It's Thanksgiving, not...
Truth Day!
Look, when everyone eats
that banana-meat thing...
they'll all make fun of her.
Do you want that?
We'll just get everyone
to sweet-potato pie.
Dude, they're not objects.
Just kidding. I'll talk to them.
You distract her.
Hey, Rach, can I talk to you
outside for a sec?
Okay.
What's up, Ross?
So....
Thanksgiving.
The holiday season is upon us.
And...
you look nice today.
-Oh, no. No, Ross, don't do this.
together is a good idea.
I thought this might happen today.
I know the holidays can be rough...
and it's probably hard
for you to be alone right now.
You're alone.
No, I live with Phoebe.
I mean, you're alone-alone.
And it's just not the time
for us. I'm sorry.
Oh, well.
pretending to like it...
I learned some things in acting
class. Try rubbing your stomach.
Or saying, "Mmm."
Smiling.
I'm not gonna pay
for those acting classes anymore.
Rachel, there you are.
You don't get any dessert.
Really?
No, just kidding.
I would never do that to you.
Okay, everybody, it's trifle time.
So, Rach, this is a traditional
English trifle, isn't it?
-It sure is.
with beef or eggplant?
-Beef.
-I can't have any. I don't eat meat.
Monica, I want you
to have the first taste.
Really?
Wait, you only got whipped cream.
You gotta take a bite
who's eating it.
I think we should have everyone
taste how good it is.
Especially Ross.
This is so good that I'm gonna
go enjoy it on the balcony.
So that I can enjoy the view
this is from Monica's room.
I'll help dial.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom...
so I can look at it
in the mirror as I eat it.
What was that all about?
Does it not taste good?
-Let me try it.
to fly away with it...
and then just dropped it
on the street?
If it's any consolation,
before the bird dropped it...
he seemed to enjoy it.
Rachel, come here.
I was taking my Thanksgiving nap
-I don't know, let's see.
I dreamt we were getting married...
and he left because
he had to go fight a fire.
So I went to a nightclub
and I saw him making out with a girl.
Oh, my God, he dream-cheated on you!
But then Jacques Cousteau came...
and he kicked his ass
and introduced me to his sea horse...
who was coming on to me.
Please, that is not gonna happen.
Boy, I'm glad I wore
the big belt today.
Five minutes ago, a line like that
I am still a woman.
Ross? Let's go.
Oh, yeah.
About telling Mom and Dad...
I was thinking about
maybe writing a letter.
That's it. You've had your chance.
Mom, Dad. Ross smoked pot in college.
You are such a tattletale!
Mom, Dad...
you remember that time
Chandler didn't melt your records.
Ross did.
-Is that true?
-And Dad...
you know that mailman
that you got fired?
He didn't steal your Playboys.
the porch swing. Monica did!
Ross hasn't worked
at the museum for a year!
Monica and Chandler
are living together!
Ross married Rachel in Vegas!
to put beef in the trifle!
I want to go!
That's a lot of information
to get in  seconds.
All right. Joey, if you want
to leave, just leave.
Rachel, no, you weren't supposed
Jacques Cousteau is dead.
Monica, why you felt
you had to hide the fact...
that you're in an important
relationship is beyond me.
And we kind of figured
Ross' best friend all these years...
stuck by him
during the drug problems...
and now you've taken on
Monica as well.
Well, I don't know what to say.
You're a wonderful human being.
-Thank you!
I'm gonna do about the two of you.
I'll talk to them.
You guys, it was bananas...
cream and beef!
I just cannot believe that you ate
that so that I wouldn't feel bad.
Well, actually, I didn't eat mine.
It's still in the bathroom.
No, I ate that.
And we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
Nope, got it and got yours too.
Chandler, are you gonna stick
Swooped right in there.
-Hi.
-Oh, Janine.
-It's not over, is it?
-Yeah.
We all got depressed.
-Nice to meet you.
-I think we've already met.
-Really?
I live across the hall.
You walked in on me when I was changing.
Why is everybody using
help decorate her tree?
Did someone get her
drunk again, or...?
Having a perfect tree is
not what Christmas is about.
It's about being with loved ones.
That is nice. And we're done.
feel like Christmas to me.
Oh, here.
See, now it feels like Christmas.
The One With The Routine
And that's the story of the dreidel.
Some people trace the Christmas tree
to the Egyptians...
who'd bring palm branches into huts
on the shortest day of the year...
symbolizing life's
that you started this story.
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey. What's up?
I had to get out of the apartment.
Janine's stretching all over.
Everywhere I look she's like....
I can see why that's hard to resist.
I like her so much.
I'm sorry she doesn't feel the same.
I know. And she's so sweet.
I just want to feed her grapes
not a monkey, right?
I am so over Janine.
Yeah, at first I thought she was hot,
but now she's like old news.
-Hey, guys.
-Janine!
I'm gonna be a dancer on a TV special
Dickin' Rockin' Dicky Eve.
Hold it.
Are you talking about
Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve?
Yeah, that's what I said.
Oh, my God, we love that show!
Ross and I have been watching it
since I can remember.
You're still just a little
Those guys rock the most!
They said to bring someone.
Want to be my dance partner?
I would love to spend
New Year's with you.
They're taping tomorrow.
in Times Square is actually live.
But they tape some of the party stuff
ahead of time.
Not a lot of people know that.
Do you guys want to come too?
-Are you serious?
-We are there!
What are you laughing at?
Well, I used to date him,
Great, so we can all go together.
I gotta run. I'll catch you later.
Bye, Janine.
Did she just ask me out on a date?
I don't think so.
She invited him to the biggest
party of the millennium.
Yeah, but she also invited
you and Ross.
I'm sorry, I don't think that
But, hey, I know how I can find out.
It's a New Year's Eve party.
So at midnight, I can kiss her.
And if she kisses me back, great.
If she says, "What are you doing?"
I can say, "lt wasn't me,
it was New Year's."
That's better than Ross
because he needed Chap Stick.
It was a dry day.
We are going to Dick Clark's
New Year's Rockin' Eve!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Okay, I've been on sets before...
so let me give you some advice.
It's a show, but we're just dancing.
It's no big deal.
Important thing to remember:
-Okay.
Oh, my God!
It's just like I dreamed it!
Everyone! Gather up!
-Excuse us!
-Excuse us!
The music's gonna start,
at the camera. Questions?
Yeah, I have a question.
When is this gonna air?
Yeah. Now, you guys dance
over there...
you guys, over there.
because we're brother and sister.
Yeah, it would seem kind of weird.
As weird as coming all the way down here
and then having to go home right now?
So when is it gonna air?
You look in the kitchen,
I got the closet.
I can save you time, ladies.
This doesn't concern you.
We're looking for our presents
from Monica.
That's terrible.
No, we do it every year.
Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.
Yeah, we never find them.
She's always bested us,
that wily...minx.
We'll search here for an hour...
and then we'll go to Joey's
-We have to.
You don't have to. And you can't,
because I live here too.
Well, then you should look with us.
Why?
Aren't you worried about
what to get Monica?
No, I have a great idea
A great idea? Oh, yeah?
What if she gets you
a great present...
two mediums
and lots of little ones...
and you just get her one present?
Why? Why?
-If I help, we can find them faster!
-Right!
We have a live one!
-Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
-Yeah.
Who's it for?
"Dear losers, do you really think
I knew they'd break you."
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
We are so gonna find them this year.
You said you'd go across the hall
and look. Do you do that every year?
Yeah.
You don't go into the back
of my closet...
and look under my gym bag
-No.
That's where Joey gave me stuff
to store that I've never seen.
Okay, that did not just happen.
Here comes a camera.
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Why do they keep doing that?
We have to get up on one
of those platforms.
They've been taping them all day.
Right.
What'd you guys do
forget how to put on underpants?
Yeah!
-Hey, you're a good dancer.
-Really?
You'd be better if you
loosened your hips.
-What do you mean?
That's better.
You're dancing with her.
-We're together.
-Yeah, we came together.
I don't see it.
You are dancing with the tall guy.
Tall guy, raise your hand!
Hey, buddy. Let me dance with her.
Hey, wait!
Yeah, we found them.
They were in the guest-room closet.
You have nothing to worry about
because they're crap.
Those are mine.
I got those for you.
Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great!
Chandler, what is this very weird
That's a great gift.
Oh. Okay, I'm sorry.
Thank you for my "az."
Make sure you put all that stuff
back in the closet.
Yes, okay.
By the way, I think it's really nice
that stuff for Joey.
Hey, dancing girl?
Can I go to the bathroom?
Here we go. Yeah.
Looking good, Gellers!
We know!
That snippy guy's the one who
decides who gets on the platform.
-We should go dance by him.
-Okay.
Okay, everybody, hold!
Next on the platforms are....
You two! And....
-You two!
wearing underpants?
Monica!
Would it?
How about me?
Hey, tall guy!
I want to talk to you about that girl
you're dancing with.
She's nice, huh? To think I almost
brought my wife to this.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Look, I came with that girl, okay?
I plan to kiss her
you came with?
I was hoping after tonight
that maybe I could....
No. No. She's fair game
if you ask me. Sorry, buddy.
All right. Hey.
Fair is fair. When you're right,
who wet his pants.
Monica would not
hide the presents down here.
No, but she did. Look, there's
that old hippie I've always wanted.
If they are here,
He's had a huge crush on me.
That's not fair to play with his head,
though. You do it.
Okay.
Hey, Gunther.
Hi.
Getting to be that holiday time again, huh?
Yes, it's like a miracle.
I was thinking, since it's the time
of giving gifts...
I was wondering, are there any
-That's the Toys for Tots collection bin.
-That's awfully convenient, don't you think?
-For the tots it is.
-Hey, you guys, guess what.
-Did you find them?
No, Gunther fainted.
Man, this sucks.
If Mom and Dad don't see us
the losers then?
I know what'll get us up
on a platform.
What?
The routine!
We haven't done the routine
since middle school.
When the snippy guy
our own platform.
Was it that good?
We got honorable mention in the
brother/sister dance category!
It's almost fake midnight.
Do we really have any other choice?
Okay, let's do it.
Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
Five, six, seven, eight!
So do we really need to ask who's
again, exactly like that.
Get this. Dick will want
it for the Bloopers show.
All right, cut!
Listen up, everyone!
When we start again,
everybody's excitement!
Hey, guy!
You got three seconds to get away.
What's going on here?
Take a look at the guy's pants!
You told us to show excitement,
but don't you think he went overboard?
What's the matter with you? Go!
Yeah, take a hike, wet pants!
Can you believe this?
We're on the platform
for the millennial moment!
I know!
You haven't been practicing
going into the robot.
Ross, we should stick to the routine.
We don't want to look stupid.
All right, we're back!
Ten seconds left.
-Ten.
-Okay, it all comes down to this.
Whatever happens, happens.
Destiny.
three, two, one!
-Cut!
-No!
Year!
Happy "No" Year!
Now we go to the live shot
of Times Square. That's a wrap!
What did that snippy guy say?
I think he's kicking out
sense of direction.
I thought maybe they could help us
find the presents.
Yes, if the presents are hidden
south for the winter.
Or we could just follow your clever
the presents are.
The duck seems to think that
Monica got me garbage.
I wonder what I could get Monica
that's as good as garbage.
How about my "az"?
-Hey. This is hollow.
I can't believe I never knew that!
-Oh, the presents!
-Don't look directly at them!
What?
All right, no, we could look at them.
This one's for me!
This one's for Chandler. Here.
-And the big one's for me!
-Oh, let's open them!
-Wait a minute. We can't do this.
what Monica got me.
I'm sure she worked hard at getting it
and wanting to surprise me.
And you guys are gonna ruin that.
We have to put these back.
This is not what Christmas is about.
Whatever, Linus.
when I give her my present.
I'm sure she wants to see the look
on my face when I get mine.
So, please, please, can we just...?
Can we put them back?
-Will you get us better gifts?
to find you that water purifier?
-That's what you got me?
-Yes, I see. That look is priceless.
Home sweet home, huh?
Nice to get back to reality.
Plus, we know how the New Year's
gonna go off.
I guess there's no reason for all
-Yeah?
Three...
two, one.
Happy New Year.
What was that for?
Tonight when they yelled "cut"
and we didn't get to kiss...
I was really, really disappointed,
and I just....
I just really wanted to kiss you.
Really?
In the moment, I really wanted
-But only in the moment.
So do you want to kiss again?
Sure. New Year's Eve
is only two weeks away.
Can you wait?
No.
Me neither.
Three, two....
You don't have to count down
every time we kiss.
Oh. Okay.
Except I sort of felt like I needed
dance into the new millennium...
and the guy yells, "Cut!"
-So Joey didn't get to kiss Janine?
-Nope, he sure didn't.
I guess that means
that you guys are still tied.
I don't know about that.
that you actually did...
the routine from eighth grade?
Yeah! But of course we had
to update it a little bit.
Hey, by the way, quick thinking
about catching me.
There's no way you could've
I mean, stronger back then.
I can do it, okay?
Come on, let's go! Come on.
One, two, three, four...
five, six, seven, eight.
I can't do it!
Now, you do that, you're on TV.
Listen....
You think I have a chance with Janine?
We've been through this.
Don't do this to yourself.
She made it clear it isn't
going to happen.
All right, then. I guess I shouldn't
get too excited...
that I just kissed her!
-Are you serious?
you won fair and square.
Yeah, it was real neck and neck
there for awhile.
So you kissed. Then what happened?
I came over here to tell you guys.
So she's waiting over
there for you?
Yeah.
The One With The Apothecary Table
-I gotta go.
for dance class.
Okay.
-Okay, now I'm really leaving.
-All right.
But can you just...
just leave your lips?
Have you kissed her yet?
It's awesome!
I could do it forever.
You know what? She kisses better
than my mom cooks.
I'm so glad you said, "cooks."
Look, it's like
by, like, .
Wait a second, you dated Ross.
And you date Chandler.
Okay, multiply it by, like, .
Rachel, you've got to tell
the post office that you've moved.
We still get your bills and stuff.
Pottery Barn!
-Yeah. It's an apothecary table.
Does anyone even know what
an apothecary is?
A pharmacist.
"A pharmacist."
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
I hate Pottery Barn too.
They kicked me out just
because I sat on a bed.
You took off your pants and
have a story behind it.
This has a story behind it.
They had to ship it all the way
from the White Plains store.
It's got to be one-of-a-kind.
Like that God-awful ceramic fruit
bowl she has on her counter?
Hey! I made that for her.
-You made pottery?
I found in the garbage.
If you put that in her apartment,
you'll never hear the end of it.
I'll tell her that it's an antique.
She doesn't have to know
where it came from.
I love these little drawers.
Oh, look! It says that
of yore.
Your what?
-What?
-What?
Enjoy the catalog, sweetheart.
"That's not a cow,
and you're not milking."
I'm so glad you're together.
We wanted a couple to go out with,
What a great restaurant!
And, Chandler, I can't believe
I let you pay for this one.
Thanks again, man.
If you come over tomorrow,
I'll make pasta.
-That'd be great!
bring the wine.
-You don't have to.
-I insist.
-You'll get the wine, right?
-Yeah.
-Okay, good night.
out of that one?
I can't handle two
nights in a row with them.
What's wrong with them?
They're just a little...
blah!
Blah?
Well, you know, he's blah.
She's just...
She's very loud for such
Because that'd be a problem.
Of course we can still
hang out with them.
Just not two nights in a row.
-Okay?
-I guess.
Thank you.
I'll sell my friends and use
Where did you get it?
Guess.
A flea market?
I knew you would get it
on the first guess.
Isn't it cool?
It's an apothecary table.
You can just imagine
to make potions.
You can almost smell the opium.
Almost.
How much was it?
Just only  bucks.
Five hundred bucks at a flea market?
I thought you meant how much was it...
when it was new, back then.
It was at a flea market,
so it was like a dollar.
-A dollar?
-And ?
So it was like
-Yeah.
Well, what period is it from?
It's from yore.
Like the "days of yore," you know?
Yes, I do.
-It's just perfect.
-Oh, good.
I bet it has a great story too.
Did they tell you
where it's from or...?
Yes, that I know.
-Hi!
Oh, my God!
-You like it?
-Oh, my God!
It's my new apothecary table!
Phoebe will be here any second.
She can't see this.
Why not? She'll love it.
she'll know I lied.
-I said ours was an original.
-Why?
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
She hates Pottery Barn?
She says it's all mass-produced...
nothing is authentic, and everyone
winds up having the same stuff.
So come on!
Pottery Barn sheets.
I forgot they made sheets!
I still can't believe
she hates Pottery Barn.
It's not like she hates you.
Yeah, but Pottery Barn?
You know what I think?
She's just weird.
It's because she's a twin.
her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.
You know what's not one-of-a-kind?
A twin!
Let's turn out the lights
and watch the movie.
-Hey, cool sheet!
-Sure.
At a flea market.
You buy your sheets
at a flea market?
Come on, you gotta loosen the
purse strings a little.
Dinner will be ready in  minutes.
Here is the wine to bring
buy Monica flowers...
but you couldn't, because
you paid for dinner last night.
Thanks. But it's just
gonna be me tonight.
-What happened to Janine?
-Yeah, she's been in there all day.
High fever, nose problem.
It's...
phlegm, phlegm,
phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.
Monica! Chandler!
I'm sorry about tonight. I don't
of going to this play.
Have a great time, huh?
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
Oh, no, she really is sick.
Then why is she going to a play?
Well, you know, "Starve a fever...
go to a play for a cold."
Why is Janine not coming
over for dinner?
She didn't want to hang out with
you guys two nights in a row.
I'm so sorry.
Why doesn't she want
you are blah.
And that you, Monica,
are too loud.
What?!
What?
So she just pretended to
have a good time?
She was lying to our faces?
I can't believe this.
-And I am not blah. I am a hoot!
Come on, please, you guys.
Don't be mad.
I'm sure she said it...
because she was nervous because
you're my best friends.
And it was our first date.
Plus, she's really sick.
You said you made that up!
But isn't the sick thing
go with, "Monica's drunk again."
Come on, please just
give her another chance.
-She'll come around, I promise.
-Of course we will.
-Come on, we gotta make dinner.
feet up on my new..?
Old sheet.
Oh, sure.
My apothecary table!
-What?
-No!
-Where did you get this?
-At Pottery Barn, okay?
Oh, my God!
Pottery Barn has ripped off
than one and  dollars.
This doesn't even
smell like opium.
It smells like wine,
which you spilled.
And thanks for wrecking my sheet.
Ross, calm down. I'll give
-I know!
What are you guys doing?
Nothing. We're just talking.
You know, blah-blah-blah.
Come on, you said you were gonna try.
I came over to invite you to
a movie with me and Janine.
-What do you say?
we have the time.
Very funny. I don't know
what to do.
I really want you to get along.
Please come to the movie with us.
You owe me.
-We owe you?
start of your relationship.
I helped you sneak around
for six months.
I looked like an idiot.
And I was humiliated.
And I only made $.
We didn't give you any money.
You don't think I know that?
I can't decide if it goes
better by the new chair...
the Sahara desk...
or the Parker console table.
I didn't know there was
-A little?
Your place looks like page 
of the catalog.
Look at that!
The ornamental birdcage!
Large.
Oh, Ross? Be careful.
bring their birds to market in that.
Fascinating.
Another amazing find!
-I bet this has a great story too.
-It does.
It is a room-separating apparatus
from Colonial times.
A lot of this stuff is from
time periods, Rachel?
Well, there's yore.
And, you know, yesteryear.
Rachel has such a
good eye for this stuff.
Ross, if you ever decide
to redecorate...
and I think you should...
you should ask Rachel to help.
He doesn't need my help.
I think he's ready to get rid
and dinosaur junk"?
Really?
You know, since you have such a
great sense of what I need..
Here's  bucks.
Why don't you take Phoebe down
to that Colonial flea market...
and get me some stuff.
I don't think Phoebe wants to come.
-I do want to.
-Yeah!
-I'm gonna get my purse.
-Okay.
Hey, can I have all this stuff
when she makes you throw it out?
Well, sure, and I'll show you
just better last time.
Well, at least I got these
sheets for Ross.
Look at this. Pottery Barn.
You know what? Don't look at it.
-Seriously, don't look at it.
-Look!
There's the table
and the birdcage and...
Wait a second, this is our
exact living room!
No, it's not.
Come on, ours is totally different.
I mean, we don't have the..
We don't have that lamp.
And that screen is on
got all our stuff.
Pottery Barn! Oh, my God!
Okay, I did, all right?
I'm sorry.
I wanted this stuff, and I know
how you feel about Pottery Barn.
-Come on, don't be mad.
wrong with the world...
and it's in my living room...
and all I can think about is
how I don't have that lamp!
Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.
We have that  bucks from Ross.
I can't! I can't!
Unless...
Are you saying you'd move out
if I didn't buy that lamp?
No, I'm not gonna move out!
But are you saying that you would
-Then I don't have a choice.
-I have to buy that lamp!
-That's right.
But at least the apothecary
table's real.
This was great.
and I've got to say...
I'm sorry if I was weird after
the last time we went out.
I guess I was just nervous.
-That's understandable.
-Don't worry about it.
So we can go out again?
-Absolutely.
boring than modern dance...
is you talking about it.
"Oh, Chandler, I just lost
myself in the movement."
You know, I know you're talking...
but all I hear is,
"Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah."
All right, you and me!
I gotta talk to Janine.
I really think you could take her.
You better hope I don't
see you in the hallway!
All right.
Look, we got a little bit
of a problem here.
You can't my treat
-I know, I'll talk to them about it.
They mean so much to me.
They're like my family, you know?
If you guys are gonna be
fighting all the time....
I don't think we can be together.
It just can't work, okay?
It can't.
I'm very upset.
Okay.
Would it help if I apologized?
Yeah.
That'd be very helpful.
What did I tell you about the hall?
I was coming over to
could be friends.
Well, I know that would
make Joey happy, so...
I would like that too.
-Great.
-Now, come on.
-I'm glad we worked it out.
-Bye.
-Or I'll hear you.
-That's it, big girl!
Wait!
You'd better run!
Did you hear that?
-What am I gonna do?
-I'm sorry, man.
-Want to go watch?
you could have taken Janine.
I could have taken her.
-She's much bigger than you.
-Are you kidding me?
I know what to do with tall girls.
You go for their knees.
-How you doing?
broke up with her.
When it's not right, you know it.
-You okay?
-I'll be all right.
-You know what would cheer you up?
-What?
I'm giving this lecture on
with pictures of naked women in them.
Don't tell him about the videos!
I made up a joke
and sent it in to Playboy.
They printed it.
I didn't know they print jokes.
They print jokes, interviews,
hard-hitting journalism.
It's not just about the pictures.
Didn't work on Mom,
-I made that joke up.
No, you didn't. I did.
Yes, I did. I told Dan and he said it
was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
Hey, tell Dan thanks.
What?
I was just reading the joke below it.
Man, that one is funny.
Monica, you remember me
-Seriously?
You tell a lot of jokes.
Look, it's my joke.
But if it makes you feel better,
they don't print the name.
So it doesn't really matter
who gets credit.
Yeah, I guess.
-Hey, guys.
They'll tell you!
-My joke!
-My joke!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jokes? What...?
You know there's naked chicks
in there, right?
The One With The Joke
Dude! You have got to turn on
time and they may break up.
Let's watch that at your place.
Monica's watching a show. I don't
want to miss when they were skinny.
Hey, Chandler?
You know what we should do?
You and I should go out
-No. No, that's VH.
I tell you, the music
these kids listen to today...
it's a lot of noise to me.
Why is your cable out?
Oh, because I haven't really
paid the bill.
If you need money,
Janine moved out. God, was she hot.
I know, yeah.
Look, I can handle it, all right?
I can listen to the radio.
And Ross gave me this great book.
Want to see if the joke stealer
will let us watch at his place?
Sure.
-Paid your phone bill?
-Looking at a Playboy.
I want to look too!
Yikes!
Do you think these pictures
are trying to tell a story?
Sure. Like in the case
of this young woman...
she has lost her clothes.
So she rides naked on the horse,
lying in the grass like that.
Remember the days when you'd
go out to the barn...
Lift up your shirt and bend over?
You see, now, I would date this girl.
She's cute, she's outdoorsy.
And she knows how to build a fire.
That'll come in handy.
I got a question.
If you had to pick one of us to date,
-Me neither.
Rachel.
What?
I don't know.
Me neither.
You know, you forget how many
great songs Heart had.
"Barracuda" was the first song
I learned to play on the keyboard.
So you heard it, you repeated it...
so that must mean you wrote it.
You guys with this joke.
but I'm not even sure I got it.
What?
You didn't get it?
The doctor is a monkey.
And monkeys
can't write out prescriptions.
You are not allowed
to laugh at my joke.
Your joke?
Well, I think the Hef
and you stole my money?
I was gonna stick it in the ATM.
But now I think I'll show
the sexy teller...
that I am a published writer.
She'll know that you stole the joke.
You gonna follow me there?
-Yeah.
-I'm not gonna go now.
Okay.
Here you go.
Gunther?
I can't pay now,
on some luxuries like...
paying for stuff, so....
Well, if you want, you can work here.
I don't know.
It's just....
See, I was a regular on a soap opera,
you know?
And to go from that to this,
it's just....
And plus, I'd have to wait
as much as you want.
What?
Flexible hours.
Maybe I could be a waiter.
Could I use the phone?
She picked Rachel.
She tried to back out of it, but
it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
He took my joke. He just took it.
This is wrong.
You know what else is wrong?
Phoebe picking Rachel.
Know who else picked Rachel? Ross.
Know what else Ross did?
you know?
And document the date and time
of every single one of my jokes.
Good idea. Know what's a bad idea?
-Picking Rachel.
-That's right.
Did you hear something?
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing
-Hey.
Don't you guys look cute.
You guys make a cute couple.
What are you doing?
Just trying to re-create some of
the fun that we had at my place.
Remember? When you picked
Rachel over me?
That was funny.
-It was kind of funny.
bit more toward Rachel than you...
is just, you know, you're...
high maintenance.
Let's go to lunch!
That is completely untrue.
You think I'm high maintenance?
Prove it.
You write out a list, and
as Rachel. She's just more...
flexible and mellow. That's all.
Well, people are different.
Rachel will do whatever you want.
You can just walk all over her.
What? Are you saying that I'm
a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Oh, okay. You're not a pushover.
You think I'm a pushover.
Pretty strong, I think.
Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
You start working on that list.
-I cannot believe her.
-I know. Where do you want to eat?
-Oh, I love that Japanese place.
-I'm sick of Japanese. Not there.
Wherever you want to go is cool.
Oh, hey, Gunther...
check this out.
Yeah, that Chandler cracks me up.
You want anything to drink?
-Sure.
-Coffee?
-No.
Coffee? I'm going up there.
No, thank you.
You need anything?
I'm heading up there.
I'd love ice water.
You got it.
What are you doing?
Just being friendly.
You're not supposed to go back there.
It's okay. Right?
Don't wink at me.
And put on your apron.
Okay.
I don't see you asking other
-No.
-Waiter.
-Yeah!
What's going on?
Why didn't you tell us you work here?
It's kind of embarrassing. I mean,
the other direction.
So's your apron.
You're wearing it like a cape.
I mean, the job's easy
and the money's good, you know?
I guess if I'm hanging out here,
serving you guys, you know?
It'll be great.
Come on, I did it and it was fine.
Why would it be weird?
Hey, Joey? Can I get some coffee?
It doesn't seem that weird.
I asked before.
You still haven't gotten it.
See, now it's weird again.
You're gonna make a lot of money.
Here's your first tip.
Don't eat yellow snow.
:, coffeehouse.
This is great. Finally,
I learned working here.
First, the customer is always right.
A smile goes a long way.
And if anyone is ever rude to you,
sneeze muffin.
Thanks, Rach.
Hey, look, you guys are just terrific,
you know?
How about clearing out
I'll toss in a free muffin.
Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you.
Okay.
So, maybe I am
a little high maintenance.
And maybe Rachel is
a little bit of a pushover.
But you know what you are?
We are sorry to tell you this,
with being flaky?
Yeah, totally.
Then I'm okay
with being high maintenance.
Yeah. And I am okay
with being a pushover.
That's great. Good for you guys.
-I am not high maintenance!
-You did!
I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
Hey, Gunther.
Can you cover for me?
I got an audition.
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
I like your natural color.
It's a great part.
I'm the lead guy's best friend.
I wait for him and save his seat.
-Maybe he's not his best friend.
I'll see you.
Oh, man.
I could totally get that part.
"I'm sorry, this seat is taken."
-Excuse me.
-No, I didn't mean you.
But you believed me?
I believed you were saving this seat
All right, everybody listen up!
The coffeehouse will be closed
for about an hour.
What?
It's for the kids.
Yeah, to keep the kids off drugs.
It's a very important issue
in this month's Playboy.
I'm sure you all read about it.
Hey! Don't you wanna keep guns
-It's a vicious cycle. Get out!
Go!
-It's my joke.
-It's my joke.
It's my joke.
I don't think we're gonna settle this.
Let's have Monica decide.
-Hey, Mon!
-Get out here!
-Monica?
in the world.
Don't try to sway her.
I'm your only chance to have a baby.
-Okay, let's go.
-All right.
We'll each tell you
how we came up with the joke...
then you decide which one of us
at lunch with Steve.
-Did I meet him at Christmas?
-Can I finish?
You want me to pick you?
See, I would never
snap at you like that.
Two babies.
-Continue.
And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.
I said, "Dr. Monkey?" And that is how
the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.
Are you kidding?
Okay, look, I study evolution.
Remember? Evolution.
Monkey into man.
Plus, I'm a doctor. And...
I had a monkey.
I'm Dr. Monkey!
I'm not arguing with that.
I've heard enough for my decision.
-Okay, so what..?
-Do tell.
You are both idiots.
It's not funny.
over who gets credit.
You should argue over who gets blamed
for inflicting this joke on the world.
Now, let it go.
The joke sucks.
-It's your joke.
-It is not.
-Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are.
not being high maintenance.
Monica is a self-sufficient,
together lady.
Being with her
has been like being on a vacation.
And what may be perceived
fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Really? I've heard better.
Wait, he came up with that himself.
Tell them.
I'm out of words.
Should I say it again?
Look, I am not high maintenance!
I am not. Chandler!
You're a little high maintenance.
You are on my list!
Look, I'm sorry, but you're not..
You're not easygoing,
things, I think I'm pretty good...
at making you feel better.
That's good too.
They say you're high maintenance...
but it's okay, because I like...
maintaining you.
I didn't tell him that.
-You're off my list.
-I'm off the list.
Phoebe?
It's okay that you don't want me
suddenly I find you very attractive.
How'd the audition go?
Oh, not good. No.
I didn't get the part.
And I lost my job here, so...
Wow, that is a bad audition.
Well, how did you lose your job here?
I had the audition...
but Gunther said I had to stay
so he could get his hair dyed.
So I went anyway, and he fired me.
He left work
when you've been here two days?
That's not right.
What are you gonna do?
You can't let him get away with that.
I won't let him get away with that.
I'm gonna say..
I shouldn't say anything.
No, I should say something!
Gunther?
-Okay.
-What?
-He can have his job back.
That's right,
he can have his job back.
Glad we got that all straightened out.
There you go, Joey.
-Got your job back.
Now who's a pushover?
-Rach, you're in my seat.
-I'm sorry.
I never heard who you'd pick
to be your girlfriend.
-I'd pick you, Phoebe.
-It would totally be you.
If you had to pick one
of the other two to go out with...
who would you pick?
-No way.
-I'm not answering.
Joey.
No way, I'm not answering that.
Okay, Rach, that's muffin
Chandler, coffee and a scone, $..
And Phoebe, herbal tea, $..
All together that's $..
This coming from the man who couldn't
split our $ phone bill in half.
How much do I owe you?
That's on the house,
courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Great. Well, tell him thanks.
And since Joey seems like
being so forward...
but I could check with him.
He says it's okay.
Great. Thanks. Bye-bye.
How come our stuff isn't free?
It will be when you look like
that in a tight skirt.
I'm getting more dates than ever.
You're only giving free stuff
-I do.
Here. Sorry.
Oh, you know what?
No.
Wait a second.
-I know it's in here.
-You know what? I'm good.
Sorry, I guess it's in my big bag.
Say, does anybody have a goldfish?
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be at work?
They sent me home.
-I'm not sick!
I don't get sick. Getting sick is
for weaklings, it's for pansies.
No one thinks that you're a pansy...
but we do think
that you need a tissue.
I have not been sick
that used to be in your nose.
I'll get tissue.
I don't need a tissue. I'm fine-d.
When you put a D
at the end of fine...
you're not fine.
I'm fine-d.
I'm fine-d.
It's a really hard word to say.
-Yes?
-Hi. Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
Oh, my God, Jill!
Oh, my God, Rachel!
Oh, my God, introduce us.
This is Chandler.
And that's Joey.
-How you doing?
-Don't!
Honey, what are you doing here?
Which sister is this?
Is this the spoiled one
or the one that bit her?
Daddy cut me off.
Never mind, I got it.
You know what I said?
I said, "I'll hire a lawyer,
for my lawyer.
Then he told me to learn
the value of money...
from the one daughter
he's actually proud of.
Did you hear that?
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Honey, so what did you do
that made Dad cut you off?
Okay, I bought a boat.
You bought a boat?
It wasn't for me,
it was for a friend.
Boy, did we make friends
I shouldn't have done it...
but she bought me all these CDs
and said I had a cute haircut.
And your daddy didn't understand?
I know, and usually I just cry
and say I'm sorry and he forgives me.
Oh, yes, good criers, the Green girls.
I mean, the Green sisters.
Man, no matter how you say it...
it still sounds like you're
could've happened to you.
You've needed to get out on your own.
When I did it, at first I was scared,
but then look at me now.
I am the only daughter
that Dad is proud of.
I can't believe him.
won't buy stuff for a while.
I don't understand.
This is what you'll do.
You're gonna get a job.
You're gonna get an apartment.
And then you will live off
the money that you earn.
Okay, I know this is what you did...
but that doesn't sound like me.
Okay, but it can be. It can be you.
And you can stay with us.
-Oh, that's so great!
Okay, I'm really gonna do this.
I don't know how to thank you.
Oh, I like cars.
-You all finished?
-Yes.
Great.
Okay, here are the tips
and Joey owes  dollars.
-What?
-For all the free food you gave away.
If it's free, how come
you're charging me for it?
We don't give anything away
in a modeling contest?
No.
Sorry.
I just had the hardest day.
Some of these are so heavy.
How did you pay? I thought
your dad took your credit card.
I memorized those numbers
make-it-on-my-own stuff I got!
This is my "Please hire me" sweater.
And these are my "Don't you want
to rent me this apartment?" pants.
Charging clothes to your dad doesn't
qualify as making it on your own.
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get
it's a good idea.
-So who made her queen of the world?
-I would love that job!
What's going on?
Jill!
Did you shop?
No.
They did.
Yeah, we went shopping!
You went shopping?
Then you came here
and paraded it under Jill's nose...
when you know she's trying to quit.
"I want a job" sweater.
And then I got..
These are apartment pants.
Apartment pants?
You've never heard of them?
Of course I've heard of them.
Ross, what'd you get?
I got this...
This.
-A pashmina?
-Yeah!
I love these babies.
Really?
What's a pashmina?
It's a rug.
Jill?
I'm sorry, Rachel.
You think that's gonna work on me?
One little setback is okay.
-But don't let it happen again, okay?
-Okay.
Now, since Daddy paid for all this
stuff, I should take it all away.
But I'm just gonna take the pashmina.
And the pants.
I'll take it all, because that way,
and I will see you at dinner.
She took all my stuff.
Yeah. Everything but
the little blue one.
That's the best one!
Oh, my God. Thank you so much!
Well, hey.
Oh, my gosh, that was so lame.
Like a pashmina could be a rug.
Oh, yeah? How about you
the apartment pants? How dumb was l?
-Were you this cute in high school?
-Oh, stop.
-No, you stop.
-No, you stop.
Why don't I sit here
lots of fluids.
Okay, I'll rest.
But if I'm going to bed,
then you're coming with me.
See, that would be impossible
to resist if you weren't all...
drippy here.
Are you saying that you don't
even when you're healthy.
Come on.
Don't take this personally.
I just can't have sex
with a sick person.
I'm with you. I can't have sex with
a sick person either. Disgusting!
But I'm not sick!
Let me prove it to you.
We are two healthy people
to stay in the "prime of lime."
Oh, okay, now I'll do it.
Hey. What's up?
I think there's something
you should know.
Better not be about
the apartment pants.
I just pitched the idea to my boss
after you left...
and I'm pretty sure I saw
a little spark between them.
-What?
-I mean, it's probably nothing.
But I wanted to warn you
-Yeah.
With Ross and my sister?
With my sister Jill
and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
-Oh, there is no way.
-Okay, then.
Oh, my God! I cannot believe that!
I don't like it when he dates anyone,
This is just terrible.
And I can't stop it.
I don't own Ross.
And Jill should be able to do
what she wants to do.
Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross
could've ever happened to me.
But great news about
the apartment pants, huh?
That'll be $..
What? Yesterday you said
I was too pretty to pay.
It's just, I can't,
-Amy!
Amy
Happy birthday to you
That's weird,
today's my birthday too.
Not in here, it isn't.
Sorry I'm late. What's up?
I just wanted to see if there were
any leads on the old job front.
No. But I walked past three sales
job-hunt? Ross.
-He works at the university.
-Yeah?
So you guys talked? So you get along?
So you're gonna go out?
Me go out with Ross? No.
God, no.
between you guys.
I mean, he's nice.
He's the kind you're friends with,
but not the kind you date.
He's the kind you date,
because you did. But me?
Not so much.
Oh, not so much. What do you mean?
You know, he's just a little bookish.
Are you saying he's a geek?
You think so too?
No. Ross is not a geek.
Then let's just say
he's not my type.
Handsome is not your type?
Smart, kind, good kisser.
What, those things aren't
on your list?
Ross is great.
then I'll ask him out.
Oh, no. That's not what I meant.
You know what? You're right.
He has been really nice to me.
Yeah, but he's not your type.
But maybe that's good.
I'm doing all these different things.
Maybe I should just try
dating a geek too.
Yeah, but you don't want
to try too much too fast.
You remember what happened
You need some tea? Some soup?
Calling Dr. Big.
Dr. Big to the bed.
Jeez, honey,
I thought you were asleep.
How could I be asleep knowing
that you were in the next room?
I was asleep.
No, honey. You know what's sexy?
And hot-water bottles are sexy.
Get into bed.
I want to prove I'm not sick.
I want to make you feel
as good as I feel.
Would you please get some rest?
I'm fine.
-You're coughing.
-Just something I heard before.
-Tell me.
-No, I don't want it to spoil the mood.
Happy birthday to you
-You're paying for that.
-No, it's her birthday.
You've sung "Happy Birthday"
to distribute birthday muffins.
Damn it!
Did you tell your sister
to ask me out?
-Well, yeah.
-Oh, wow! I mean, wow.
I think she's cute, but...
I never would've thought of
I figured, "Why not?"
Oh, so not really "never."
I have to say you are
a much bigger person than I am.
I mean, after all we've been through.
I wish I had a brother
to reciprocate.
If you ever date Monica,
I feel terrible.
Will you please rub this on my chest?
No, no, no.
You are not getting me this way.
Come on, I really need your help here.
-Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
-Okay.
So you're just kind of
-It's nice.
You kidding me?
Is this turning you on?
Yes.
Is it the rubbing or the smell?
It's all very, very good.
So you want to go...
mix it up?
-Not now, I'm sick.
-Oh, come on, you big faker!
What about never sleeping
all the vaporizing action.
Okay, if you really
want to have sex.
Worked like a charm.
Why are you here?
This is where Ross and I are meeting
for our date. So, what do you think?
I don't like it.
-Really?
you're right here.
Yeah, I know.
And I bet you thought it would
be weird. But it's not.
Okay.
So, well, I'll...
I'll have her home by midnight.
Why aren't you home yet?
Is someone there?
Oh, yeah, it's me. Sorry.
What are you doing here?
I'm just looking out your window...
at the view.
What are you guys doing?
We got some vapor rub in some places.
He brought her back to his apartment.
Who?
Is that your sister?
She is a slut!
Ross is on a date with your sister.
How weird is that?
Oh, my God, he's taking off
I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
He's gonna get some.
Of the glare...
from the streetlight
out of his apartment.
You know, so he's closed
the drapes there...
so he can have a nice, pleasant...
conversation with
or some juice or some....
Or some nothing.
There's nothing in here.
Who took our food?
Can I interest you in a slice
of lasagna or a drumstick?
-No, thanks.
-How about going out with me Friday night?
-No, thanks.
-What are you gonna do.
Oh! Hey, Rach.
I was just coming over here to...
Wait, I don't have to lie to you,
you don't live here anymore.
I'm eating their food.
They shut the drapes two hours ago.
I didn't know we could
date your sister.
We know you steal our food.
I'm good.
Drapes still closed?
Yeah. That perverted couple
two doors over should've shut theirs.
-Is that a swing?
is with her sister.
When Chandler kissed my sister,
I was mad for  years.
-That was five years ago.
-You got five years left.
-Joey..
There you are.
Can I get a cup of coffee?
So how was your big date last night?
It was okay. It was fun.
It was fun?
Great.
So did you guys hit it off?
I guess so.
So did anything happen?
Rumor has it you guys shut the drapes.
No. No. Nothing happened.
I shut the drapes to show her
giving me the vibe.
Was it the "Please don't show me
another picture of a trilobite" vibe?
I'm telling you,
she was in to me, okay?
Hey, you remembered trilobite.
Anyway...
If she wasn't into me,
-Yeah.
Tomorrow night. Valentine's Day.
The most romantic day of the year.
Who knows what could happen.
I might not be shutting my drapes
to show her my slides.
Okay! I got it, I got it.
I can't go with the "you
I can't do it!
It's okay.
It's too weird for you.
I won't see her again.
Thank you.
After tomorrow night.
No! I can't do it.
It's gonna freak me out!
Okay, okay, okay!
Okay. I'll tell her tonight
this semester.
Do it now. Call her now.
-This is my favorite part.
-Me too.
I don't know what you guys
are so sad about. It all works out.
E.T. stays with Elliott, and they get to
E.T. goes back home.
What?
Oh, no, I forgot.
You know what's sadder
than this? Bambi.
I cried for three days
with that movie. No, two.
The third day my mom killed herself,
over, but Bambi is a cartoon.
You didn't cry
when Bambi's mother died?
Yes, it was very sad when the guy
stopped drawing the deer.
If this movie's making you guys cry
over a Doritos commercial.
I was up for that part.
It's okay to cry. You don't
have to be macho all the time.
I'm not macho.
Yeah, you're right.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I just never really cried.
I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Come on, there's gotta be something
"Help me, Chandler.
All the other puppies pick on me."
Cry? I just found a talking puppy.
I'm rich!
I've got it. I have got it.
Pictures from your childhood.
This'll get you going good.
Oh, what's going on there?
Parents' Day. First grade.
That's me with the janitor, Martin.
-Where are your parents?
-They didn't want to come.
-Chandler!
It's not a big deal, okay?
No! It's not okay!
It's not okay at all!
You're dead inside!
-Excuse me?
-Yeah?
-Are you Phoebe Buffay?
-Yeah.
Can I get your autograph?
I've always wanted to meet you.
Sure. Yeah.
Wow. Wow, thanks a lot.
I just want to say,
I think you're really talented.
You're just saying that
because you're my biggest fan.
Take good care of that guy.
on Days of Our Lives, huh?
You want me to do a little
Dr. Drake Ramoray for you?
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
But I just got Phoebe Buffay's
-That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
I don't think so.
No, it was. She was in
Sex Toy Story Two...
Lawrence of a Labia.
And I got her autograph.
The guys at the comic book store
won't believe this.
Gunther?
Don't let that guy in here anymore.
but she's really good.
You should check out
Inspect Her Gadget.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Ross just totally blew me off,
is to start dating someone else.
Oh! There is this great guy you
will just love at work, named Bob.
He's a real up-and-comer
in Human Resources.
Maybe I talk too much, or maybe I
have worked on Ross.
But you know who that might work on?
Bob in Human Resources.
Thanks, but I'm not gonna date
some random guy from your work.
Not random. Bob.
It's probably because I'm not
like the way I dress.
No, that can't be it.
It's gotta be the smart thing.
I'm so stupid. I'm just this, like,
incredibly pretty, stupid girl.
No, honey.
Okay.
Okay. You want to know why Ross
-Because you are my sister...
and Ross and I have
this huge history.
-You want to go out with Ross?
-No.
You don't want him,
You had me doubting how smart I was!
You had me doubting my fashion sense!
It's not that big a deal. Just
don't date Ross. There's other..
You have no right
to tell me what to do.
I'm not telling you what to do.
wanting what you can't have.
Can't have?
Excuse me. The only thing
I can't have is dairy!
Well, you just blew your chances
at dating Bob!
-Who?
she is, Princess Caroline?
-You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
-Do I have my own castle?
Hey.
-Phoebe's not here, is she?
-No.
Did you get a movie?
Yeah. Yeah.
But I don't think it's the kind
reaching for the tissues all night?
Sort of.
What's going on?
Phoebe's a porn star!
-What?
-Yeah!
What are you talking about?
"Phoebe Buffay in
Buffay The Vampire Layer."
That's Phoebe.
so I ran in ahead of him...
to surprise him.
Then I pretended that I didn't
know he was in there.
Wow. I mean,
I just can't believe this.
I mean, you think you know someone.
Even Phoebe, who's always been
She had such a terrible childhood.
I had a bad childhood
and I don't do porn.
Yes, but you're dead inside.
I'd better take that back.
What, why? Why?
We can't watch it.
It's Phoebe.
We shouldn't watch this.
Absolutely not. That goes back.
-Maybe a bit.
Phoebe's our friend!
-I'm not gonna watch it.
-Yeah!
Good for you, Joe.
I thought I'd find you here,
Nosferatool.
Are you going to plunge
would be the other way around.
What's that on her ankle?
Her ankle is what you're watching?
Well, it's hard to tell.
God, if she would just stop moving.
She's just doing her job.
You sick bastards!
It's a tattoo.
That's weird. Phoebe doesn't..
Wait, that's Ursula!
That's not Phoebe! That is Ursula!
Wait, wait! I can watch that!
Rewind it! Rewind it!
Hey.
What's up? Oh, my God!
then you won't think I'm dead inside.
Oh, that's so sweet.
I don't care if you can't cry.
I love you.
Oh, that makes me feel so warm
in my hollow tin chest.
Stop it.
Seriously. We get married, I'm up
all in here.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
And if we have a baby one day...
and the doctor hands it to you
in the delivery room...
and you don't cry, so what?
If we take him to college
for the first time...
and you got nothing?
It won't matter to me.
Okay.
I won't worry
about this anymore then.
And then, you know, if I die...
from a long illness...
and you're writing my eulogy...
and you open the desk drawer
and find a note from me that says:
"I will always be with you"...
and you still can't shed
crying a river inside.
-I love you.
-What is wrong with you?!
-What?
-What?
You can't shed a tear
-No, you robot!
You damn kids! You ring my bell
one more time and I swear..
Oh, Jill!
That's a game I play
with the kids down the hall.
They've really taken a liking to me.
What's the matter?
Rachel and I had a big fight.
to see each other anymore.
I don't know anybody in this city
and I need somebody to talk to.
Sure. What happened?
I don't want to talk about it.
Okay.
-You know what might cheer me up?
-What?
Seeing some more of your
-Totally. I loved them.
You could finish telling me about
the different kinds of sand.
I'd love to. Wait right here, I'll go
get the projector and my notes.
Thanks. You're such a good friend.
Have you guys seen Jill?
-Is Ross home?
Maybe I'll call him and see
if he's seen her..
Who is it?
It's Phoebe...
"Phoebe"!
-Hey!
-Oh, God!
So you're making porn movies.
No, I'm not.
We're still rolling!
You're making one right now!
Let's go, Phoebe.
And you're using my name.
Can I help you with something?
Phoebe, come on!
Look, I'm talking right now.
a real big seller.
What?
I could talk them into giving you...
thirty dollars.
No! No way! No!
And stop using my name!
And shame on you!
And shame on all of you!
You're disgusting!
Especially you, with that!
The slides are almost ready.
Yeah.
I know what this is missing
Alcohol.
There's wine in the kitchen.
Oh, great.
What is my sister doing there,
We're just talking.
She's making something happen
with you to get back at me.
That's the only reason
she could be here, huh?
It couldn't be that maybe
she is using you to get back at me.
I think I can take care of myself.
I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.
That was your sister, actually.
She thinks you're just using me.
So?
-Hey.
-Hey.
I just came from the company
There were a lot of them.
Nice!
And I won't have to
go back there anymore...
because I gave them
my "correct address."
Isn't it gonna bother you
-Yeah.
Trying to figure out how you know me?
I'll give you a hint. From porn!
Yeah, your pervert boyfriend
watched me in a porno movie!
-See?
-Yeah.
Hey.
You may have been right about Jill.
I knew it! What happened?
She kissed me.
What? You kissed?
Maybe we should
It's easy not to kiss someone.
You just don't. Look at us
right now, not kissing!
Let me finish, okay?
She started kissing me...
and I didn't stop it.
I guess I just wasn't thinking.
Yeah. Let me give you
thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Thank you for taking your tongue out
of my sister's mouth to tell me that.
I realized if anything happened
with me and Jill...
then nothing could ever
-No, I mean...
I don't know if anything
is ever going to happen with us...
again, ever.
But I don't want to know
that it never could.
So I stopped it...
and she got mad
can't work things out!
All right, I'm leaving.
I'm not spending one more day with
someone who's out to sabotage me.
That's you, Rachel.
Yeah, I got that.
And you! I throw myself at you...
and you say no? How gay are you?
You take care, Jill.
Okay, I'm leaving. Don't worry
about me, I'll make it on my own.
Who knows how I'll get by,
I know you made up with Daddy.
-You do? How?
-Oh, just a wild guess...
and your limo just pulled up.
-Sorry I didn't get to know you guys better.
-Absolute shame.
-Okay, see you.
is here to stay, huh?
It's okay not to talk.
Hey, you guys, guess what.
-Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce.
-Oh, my God.
What is the matter with you?
No. Barry and Mindy.
Oh, sorry. I hear "divorce,"
I immediately go to Ross.
Who's Barry and Mindy?
Barry was the guy that I almost married,
asleep on top of her instead of me.
-Why did they get divorced?
-Well, apparently...
she caught him cheating on her
with someone else.
Isn't that sad?
Can you imagine if I'd married him?
how different my life would be...
if I'd never gotten divorced.
-Which time?
-The first time!
Imagine if Carol hadn't realized
she was a lesbian.
I can't.
I did a lot of karate to release the tension...
from not doing anything
else physical.
Maybe the problem was
you were pronouncing it "ka-ra-tay."
What if I was still fat?
You wouldn't be dating me,
-Come on.
You guys really think I'm that shallow?
No, I just think Monica
was that fat.
Hey, imagine if I'd never got fired
off Days of Our Lives.
Hey. Hey, there's Carol again.
What if I had had the guts
The New Yorker, being paid to be funny.
But my job's fun too.
I mean, tomorrow...
I don't have to wear a tie.
What if I'd taken that job
at Merrill Lynch?
-What?
and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Why didn't you take the job?
Because at that time, I thought that
everything that rhymed was true.
I thought if I worked with stocks...
I'd have to live in a box
and only eat lox and have a pet fox.
Yeah, you don't want that
happened, we'd still hang out?
The One That Could Have Been
Oh, my God. Rachel Green?
Rob Tilman!
No, no, it's me. Ross.
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tilman.
-No. No, no. Ross Geller.
-Of course! Monica's brother.
-Yeah. Right.
-Wow! How are you?
Good. Good. I'm married.
Me too!
-Isn't it the best?
-Really, really great.
Actually, she's right down the street.
You should stop by and say hi.
-I would love to.
-She'd be so excited.
-Okay.
to pay for...
Busty Ladies?
No, that's okay. Some kid asked me
to pick it up for him, but I....
Don't you have to give him
his money back?
Here you go, buddy.
Still going out with Dr. Boring, huh?
He's not boring. He's just...
He's low-key.
-Here you go, one hazelnut latte.
-Thank you.
You know, the hazelnut,
actually not a nut.
It's a seed.
Wow.
Can anyone else name a well-known seed
just not "Archie Comic" funny.
I gotta get back to the hospital.
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.
the Brazil nut.
Was his question,
by the way.
-Stop it, guys. He's sweet.
-Yeah, yeah.
Hey, man.
Sorry about the Archie thing.
You need me to
but I still have my pride.
Really?
Joey doesn't have to give you the money.
-TV stars have assistants, right?
-That's an idea.
If I hire an assistant,
would you take money from her?
No, Joey.
all your fan mail and stuff.
-That would be great! Let's do that!
-I could use the money.
I'd have time to write.
-Great. Welcome aboard!
-Okay!
All right. Now, I need to use the bathroom.
Since I don't need any assistance
-Hey, Phoebe.
Guess what. Joey just hired
Chandler to be his assistant.
That's so sweet.
Oh! Hang on!
Hang on!
Go!
No. No, no.
I said sell when it hits !
Five-oh! It's a number!
You're allowed one mistake.
Just kidding.
You are, of course, fired.
Oh, what a shame.
I really liked her.
Hey, Mon?
-So do you!
-Did you lose weight?
-You are so sweet to notice.
Yes, I lost . pounds!
You remember my friend Chandler.
-And that's Phoebe over there.
-Hi.
Sit down. How long has it
Sean McMahan's party.
I played you one of my songs, you know,
"lnterplanetary Courtship Ritual."
Oh, yeah. Right.
-So, now, do you still do music?
-Well, sometimes.
-Come over sometime. I'll play you..
just walked in here!
-Rach, he's a friend of ours.
-You're friends with Dr. Drake Ramoray?
It's hard to be friends with Drake...
because of his busy schedule
and the fact that he's not real.
Hey, or I could bring
-Joey?
I know. Here, here.
No. This is my friend Rachel.
We went to high school together.
-Hi.
-Hi.
I love you on that show.
I watch you every day.
When you took out your own kidney
she tried to kill you...
It's always nice to meet fans.
-She's not crazy, is she?
-No.
So how you doing?
Hang on.
Hang on. Hang on.
Go!
Who's this?
You're gonna like working for me.
What's your name?
What kind of name is "Brindy"?
Stop talking.
All right, from now on
Did you eat that too?
-There you are.
-Uh-oh, it's my boss.
Here's a list of things for you
to do today.
This is gonna be so great.
twins today, but only one of them is mine.
"Drop off my dry cleaning.
Pick up my vitamins."
"Teach me how to spell vitamins."
"Wear in my new jeans."
-You realize what you are, don't you?
-What?
You're his bitch!
No, no! No!
Wait! You didn't sit on my
little dip in the market...
and I lost  million dollars.
But the Kit Kats are all right?
What am I gonna do?
I can't call my office, they'll kill me.
I can't call my clients,
they'll kill themselves!
-Great, now my chest hurts.
-Are you having a heart attack?
If I were, would I have shooting
pains up and down my left arm?
-Yes.
-Then, yes. That is what I'm having.
Oh, my God!
Okay, this thing is useless.
didn't work for a couple weeks.
Most people don't like their jobs.
I love my job.
I've been not working for three hours,
and I'm already going crazy.
I miss Joan.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's
was nature's way of telling you to die.
You're not gonna die.
I mean, you are going to die,
but you're not gonna die today.
I wish I was dead.
Let's take a walk.
You should consider writing for
Talking Out of Your Ass magazine.
What's going on with you?
Well, I've been doing a lot more
-Yeah.
How long has it been since
you've had sex?
-Well, last weekend...
-Oh, that's not so bad.
will be two months...
since I stopped trying.
You need to spice things up.
-What do you mean?
You could eat stuff off each other.
Dirty talk, menage a trois, toys.
Role-playing.
You're the warden, she's the prisoner.
-You're the pirate, she's the wench.
-Okay, I think I got it.
Or you could be two stockbrokers, and
-Just great. He beeps me now with codes.
One is "Bring me food."
Two is
"I'm with a girl. Bring us food."
"I'm lost and I can't find food."
Oh, sweetie.
Is there any food around here?
-Is she gonna be all right?
They look ready.
And over there is Brady's Pub...
where I like to unwind
after a long day of "surgeoning."
This is so amazing. What else?
Well, that is a large piece
of television equipment.
And that is an old man.
-Hey, old man!
back to my place?
You know, I would really love to,
but I shouldn't.
Why?
Why can't the world stop turning...
just for a moment, just for us?
Isn't that a line from the show?
Yeah, but...
I may have said
squeezed orange juice you asked for.
Thanks.
There's pulp in that.
I thought we talked about this.
I don't like pulp.
No pulp. Pulp isn't juice.
All juice.
I'm sorry.
I am being so rude.
Rachel, would you like a soda
or something?
Because Chandler will
run right out and get it.
Yeah, well, sure,
if this is gonna work...
you have got to listen.
You're gonna throw that juice at me,
aren't you?
It's not all juice.
So, honey, this morning was fun, huh?
Me hopping in on you
in the shower there?
Yeah, maybe someday we could get
up a little.
-What do you mean?
-Carol, our sex life. It's just not..
-Dad!
-Hey there, little fella!
Why don't we
can put your shoes on in your room.
Seriously, our sex life.
I was thinking maybe, I don't know...
we could try some new
things, you know, for fun.
-Like what?
-Well, I don't know.
What if we were to...
tie each other up?
Some people eat stuff
-I love that idea!
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?
Oh, my God, that's so great.
You're a published writer.
I wish I had a present for you.
Wait a minute.
My last Kit Kat bar.
-You want to share it?
-Okay!
Chandler, I know you're mad.
Completely over the line.
I just... I hate pulp.
You know how Monica feels
about low-fat mayonnaise?
It's not mayonnaise!
Anyway, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, and here.
-What's this?
-Thanks, man.
Hey, Joey.
Joey? Chandler sold a story
to Archie Comics.
That's great! Congratulations!
What's the story?
You wouldn't care.
I love Archie and the whole gang.
Well, Archie needs money
to fix his jalopy.
But he doesn't want Reggie
to just give him the money.
So Reggie hires him as his assist..
As his butler.
And then makes him do crazy things...
Like bring him milk shakes
That sounds a little familiar.
Did they already do that one?
I think I read it!
Monica, listen. I have to ask.
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back
to his apartment.
-Does he do this with a lot of girls?
I mean, Joey Tribbiani.
You don't have to use his last name.
But, Monica, come on,
it's Joey Tribbiani.
I guess you have to.
It's none of my business,
but aren't you married?
Yeah.
I wish we could just not be married
like, on a break.
Well, you're not.
It's easy for you. You're not married.
You can have sex with whoever you want.
Yeah, I can.
Don't think I don't. I do.
I mean, all the time. You bet!
Monica?
You've done it, right?
Of course I have. What do you think,
I'm, like, some -year-old virgin?
Oh, my God.
in the back didn't hear you.
Yeah, I heard it.
It's not like I haven't had the
opportunity.
I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.
I'm seeing this guy Roger.
He's not perfect...
but I'm thinking maybe I should
Honey, you've waited long enough.
-You know what? You are right.
-Sex doesn't have to be a big deal.
There shouldn't be all these
rules and restrictions.
People should be able to sleep
okay for you to cheat on your husband.
What do you know, virgin?
Phoebe?
Why is smoke coming out
of the bathroom?
The doctor said that could be
one of the side effects.
Put the cigarette out.
No, it's not a cigarette.
-Okay, okay!
-I'm so glad you're here.
-Come on.
-I got it.
-Give it to me!
-I got it.
Okay, bye-bye.
Was it my work? Were they mad?
Was it Jack? Did he yell?
No, just relax. Nobody yelled.
Jack was making sure you
were getting better.
Thank God.
Yeah, she's fired.
You've done all you can, Dr. Wesley.
You've got to let her go.
Goodbye and Godspeed, Hope Brady.
Not so fast, Wesley.
Ramoray!
That's right, Wesley.
I just stopped by to say that
-Drake.
You're not dying, Hope.
You're gonna live a long,
healthy life. With me.
Oh, Drake.
Okay.
Here we go.
Hi, Joey? It's Rachel.
I am free tomorrow night.
Yeah, sure, sure,
I can bring some sandwiches.
So, honey...
this threesome thing?
How are we even gonna start to find..?
Actually, I'm making a list of women
doing their homework.
I know Gail Rosten
is in there twice...
but she is so....
Oh, I know.
You know, just talking about it
is getting me kind of...
I know. Me too.
I think Ben's asleep.
You know, I think it'll be
I can do that.
Why do you always wear
that dumb hat?
What, you late for your paper route?
"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Jones.
Here's your paper.
I'm sorry about your window."
Hey, Phoebe.
How's it going?
I've got to get out of this bed.
I hate herbal tea.
Well, I put some honey in it.
-She doesn't know she was fired?
-No, the doctors say it may kill her.
What are you girls
whispering about over there?
But I think we should tell her.
Look, Phoebe, maybe this whole
about getting a different job.
Okay, what is this,
a stupid contest?
Because we've got a winner here.
He's right. People are not supposed
to have heart attacks at .
I know. But if I didn't work there,
-That was lucrative. Smart like your brother.
What about the massage thing?
That never gave you a heart attack.
Pulling in a salary
in the high six figures...
or rubbing gross naked people
-Pretty cool, huh?
But if you think you could put a fish
in there...
and it wouldn't get sucked into
the mechanism, you'd be wrong.
Can I use your bathroom?
It's right through there.
You know, I gotta tell you.
If someone told me a week ago...
that I would be peeing
don't you?
They have parasites?
Some people say that oysters
are an aphrodisiac.
-What people?
-People.
People say it.
Come here.
So, oysters, huh?
Then we'll have a little
communicable diseases..
No, no. No.
It's sensual.
Didn't know. Okay.
Sorry, it's the hospital.
The food looks great.
Save me some?
I can't promise anything.
We're really gonna do this?
Looks like it.
If this is too weird for you,
you can still back out anytime..
I got it!
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Thank you so much.
How hot is this?!
I'm sorry you're here with me instead
of Roger.
Yeah, me too.
Well, I could make it seem like
he's here.
"Here's some little-known facts
until ."
Stop it! That's not funny!
I'm sorry, okay?
It's just...
tonight was supposed to be
a big deal.
-What was tonight?
my first time.
With Roger?
Not just with Roger?
Oh, my God.
All right, relax,
Mr. I've-Had-Sex-Four-Times!
Four different women!
I've had sex way more times.
-How many?
-Nine.
I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.
Good for you. You really think
You are sweet and wonderful...
and this is gonna happen for you.
Oh, really? When?
Do you want to do it with me?
Okay.
I was kidding.
So was I.
You're such an amazing actor.
How do you know where
Dr. Drake Ramoray leaves off...
and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Well, with Dr. Drake...
they always tell me what to say.
And with Joey, I pretty much have to
-Yeah, you did.
Here you go.
Let me ask you a question.
When was the last time...
someone told you
just how beautiful you are?
Wow.
I can't feel my hands.
Come on. Come here.
We can't do this.
Oyster?
If we did do this,
and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
But I have nothing to compare it to.
Even if you were horrible,
how would I know?
I do like that.
It's harder for me.
I have four women to compete with.
Well, if it helps,
friend helping out another friend.
Stop it. We're not doing this.
-Let's do it!
-No!
Okay!
Do you have any moves?
I have some moves.
I have no moves.
Okay, what you doing there?
-I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
-Yeah, forget it.
What if I turn out the lights?
That's the couch.
I know.
Oh, my God!
I know!
I'll tell you something.
We are gonna do that again!
Morning.
Oh, right.
Oh, God.
Oh, I can't believe Joey Tribbiani
-Because I'm married.
That's right, I'm a married woman.
I came to a TV star's apartment
to have an affair.
That's ridiculous.
I'm not a "star."
I'm just a regular famous actor.
And I'm a horrible, horrible person.
Rachel, will you stop saying that?
Hey, look.
Remember on the show
when Capri was dying?
-And she gave me..
They let you keep that stuff?
Sure. As long as they don't find out,
you can keep whatever you want.
And I want you to have it.
No, I couldn't.
Every time you look at it...
I want you to remember
that you are a good person.
Now, you had the chance to cheat...
and with me.
But you didn't.
Capri's undying love for her brother.
Look, you want the ring or not?
Hey, look at you! You're up!
I thought I'd try to take a walk.
Will you pour me some water?
I'll be back soon.
You're not gonna use
the pay phone to call work, are you?
No. I've learned my lesson.
Let's go! Come on!
Good luck with the gallbladder.
Hey, Joe...
did you ever have a threesome?
Look, Ross, I think Carol's great,
and I'm sure you're very attractive, but...
No. The reason I'm asking is that...
I sort of had one last night.
You?
All right. So? Was it amazing?
It was...
okay.
Just okay? Did you do it right?
Look, it's just, did you ever
go to a party and think:
"Would anyone really miss me
pretty much better than any other day.
It's just...
my part seemed to be over
pretty quickly...
and then there was
a lot of waiting around.
But you got to be with both of them.
Not really.
Just Carol.
-Not the other one?
see a lot of stuff.
Oh, I saw a lot of stuff.
-You get a little bored?
-A little.
Made a snack.
-What'd you have?
-Just a sandwich.
Turkey. A little mustard.
-Sounds good.
I scored with last night.
Wait a minute, that was you.
Hey, check me out. I'm a slut!
So you want to do something tonight?
I can't.
Dr. Roger's coming over again.
Oh, right.
Because you're still seeing him,
and he's a good guy.
I remember a time....
Are you okay?
Yeah, totally.
Totally. Are you?
Great. It's so amazing.
Last time Dr. Roger came over,
I'm like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
I bet he can.
"l don't have an appointment,
but I sure could use a physical."
-You sure you're okay?
-Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
My God! Barry!
You said you were going to
I am early!
Finish, please!
Surprise! Look who's back!
Call security.
Phoebe, didn't you get fired?
I don't think so.
-What are you doing here?
-All better. Back to work.
This clown from research
told me I was fired.
He should do his research, huh?
Well, you were fired.
I told that guy
So this doesn't count.
Anyway, I'll be in my office.
Phoebe, you don't have an office.
I'll work right here.
This is good. Next to this plant.
You're in my office.
I've made a lot of cash for this
company. I am talking big bucks!
Pesos! Yen! Rubles!
You make one little mistake..
You lost  million dollars.
So now this is all about money?
You know, it's bad enough that...
You have got to be kidding.
-Are you all right?
a heart attack.
Well, welcome back.
Is Joey Tribbiani here?
If you see him, please tell him
I'm looking for him...
and that this time
I am not gonna throw up!
Well, that's always good news.
Are you okay?
Me? I'm great!
I'm fine! I'm so good!
But you know who's not great?
Men!
You're a man, right, Ross?
Sit down.
Let me ask you something.
Do wedding vows mean squat
we tell you we are going out of town...
bam, there you are in bed
with the neighbor's dog-walker?
We're sorry.
No, seriously. Seriously. What has
happened to the sanctity of marriage?
-Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
with you and your husband...
and what is hopefully
an adult dog-walker.
Look, can I just say,
not all men are like that.
There are men who'll do anything
only be described as a "twosome"...
with some woman she barely knows
from the gym!
Who are these men?
Just men. A guy I know.
Well, you might want to tell him
it sounds like his wife...
is gay.
She is not...
She's gay.
Oh, my God.
She is so gay!
I can't believe this.
Good day for married people, huh?
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
I'm sorry your wife is gay.
I guess women aren't that great either.
Try telling my wife that.
Okay to come in?
Come in, eat, whatever you want.
Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Yeah, I know. Guess who beeped him.
I'm the ruptured spleen.
Why would you do that?
Because you shouldn't be with him.
You should be with me.
Really?
When you were talking about Roger,
they don't just happen.
At least not to me. I mean,
with the other two women...
in the morning, I couldn't wait
to go hang out with my friends.
But with you...
I was, you know,
to go out with me.
I make too many jokes, I've never
been in a serious relationship...
and I'm not technically a "doctor."
There was just one woman,
wasn't there?
No, there were two.
-Including me?
To finally make you see
One of them won't do it
But the second will set you free
Tell all your hate and anger
It's time to say goodbye
And that is just what I will do
Soon as those bastards I worked for
tip? Did I do something wrong?
 percent is a pretty generous tip.
You know what's more generous?
 percent!
-You know what's even more generous?
-I see where you're going.
What's up with the greed?
I'm sorry.
I have to get new headshots made,
I blackened some teeth.
Why'd I do that?
Isn't there something you can do
to earn extra money?
Can't you pick up an extra shift here?
Or, you know, I used to beg for money.
It helps if you've got
a little of this going on.
Wow! I still have it.
Don't you have an audition today?
done on me.
Finally, an explanation.
I used to get paid for
all kinds of medical stuff.
Let's see... Well, I don't want
to donate sperm again.
I really prefer doing that
or spit or something, huh?
-Joey?
-Yeah.
What did I tell you
about talking while working?
Do it?
That guy's been waiting  minutes.
morning really takes it out of you.
Takes it out of you?
Now we can kick anybody's ass.
After one class?
I don't think so.
You want to see me self-defend myself?
Pretend you're a predator.
Go on, I dare you!
Of course you can defend yourself from
an attack you know is coming.
That's not enough.
Look, I studied karate
should be familiar with.
It's what the Japanese call unagi.
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
No, it's a concept.
Yeah, it is.
It's freshwater eel.
Maybe it means that too.
I would kill for
a salmon-skin roll right now.
Fine, get attacked.
Please tell us what it is.
Unagi is a state of total awareness.
Only by achieving true unagi...
can you be prepared for any danger
that may befall you.
In case someone's trying
to steal your bamboo sleeping mat...
or your kettle of fish?
It's one thing being prepared
an attack. I don't know.. Surprise!
You knew that was coming...
but that doesn't mean
you have unagi.
If we made reservations, we could have
unagi in a half-hour.
-Is Monica here?
what to get for Valentine's Day.
Valentine's Day was two weeks ago,
so I wouldn't get her a calendar.
She was working,
so we're celebrating tonight.
Why don't you book a day for
to her boyfriend...
and her brother...
We promised to make
each other gifts this year.
-I love that.
-You guys!
You can't make crotchless panties?
You take scissors and cut..
Okay, okay, okay.
Making things sounds so much fun.
I thought so too, until I papier-mached
What did you make?
I made a flar-lar-lar.
-What is that?
-Nothing!
So, what are you gonna do?
Have you made anything
I can take credit for?
I have, I have! I started making
Valentine's Day gifts?
-Yeah.
-Do we have to make the entire thing?
Yes. Did you forget to make yours?
Of course not.
I just have to go to the place
where I made it and pick it up.
I can't wait. It'll be
Make the presents!
-What?
-Just so excited to make the presents!
Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani.
With all due respect,
I'd like to donate some fluids.
We're at the end of a research cycle
I can participate in?
-Here's a schedule.
-Thanks.
This one starts now.
Only identical twins are eligible.
It's a twin study.
But it's $!
Sorry.
And this?
"Testing the Effects of Joey Tribbiani
They're not good.
-That was good.
-Yeah.
Danger! Danger!
What the hell was that?
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
You're a freak!
Perhaps.
Now I'm curious.
At what point during those girlish
screams would you have kicked my ass?
All right, so we weren't prepared!
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic
-I can't figure out what to make Monica.
Why don't you make her
one of your little jokes?
I'm going crazy.
Do you have anything homemade?
You know what?
I made it in the sixth grade.
I could use that. I could say,
"Your love sends me to the moon."
Except Apollo  didn't
actually land on the moon.
You can say, "Your love lets me orbit
-It says "Captain Ross" on the side.
And it says "I hate Monica"
on the bottom.
Danger!
Salmon-skin roll.
Yes, honey, I made it myself.
I can't do it. I can't do it.
A mixed tape! A mixed tape!
Hi! Ready to exchange gifts?
-Sure. You go first.
-Okay, come here.
Okay, it's not wrapped
are all romantic songs.
What a great gift!
Is "The Way You Look Tonight" on it?
We'll have to listen and see.
Oh, I love it!
Thank you so much.
You ready to open yours?
It's a sock bunny.
Remember how I call you bunny?
Not really.
I did one time.
And I want to start doing it more.
-That's what this is about.
What she makes, they're sock rabbits.
They're completely different.
Okay, okay.
I didn't make it!
I forgot about tonight and that we're
supposed to make the presents.
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.
You're so incredible.
You went through all this time
I will.
I am going to cook you
anything you want in here.
And I'm going to do anything
you want in there.
Well, I did put a lot of thought
to have seen that.
Your birthday's in a month and a half.
What if I forget to get you
a present for that too?
You are totally and completely
 percent forgiven.
We've got to wash that.
Remember that jacket you loved
Get it in black, not brown.
Your cake is ready.
It's like that old saying,
"Have sex, eat some cake."
Hey, Mon. Hey, Chan.
Just getting a soda.
Who the hell are you?
I'm Joey.
How are you doing?
No! No! No! No! No!
How you doing?
How you doing?
on behalf of Carl.
Who the hell is Carl?
Did I not mention?
Carl is a guy I hired to be my twin
for a medical research project.
Sometimes the good ideas are
right in front of you.
It sounds crazy, but it might work.
commercial a couple of years ago.
We were supposed to be brothers,
but he messed up.
Can I get a piece of that cake?
Pizza! We like pizza!
Get out!
-Pat Sajak?
-Of course.
-Chuck Woolery?
-Definitely.
You will not find a single game-show
host whose ass I cannot kick.
-Say it!
it's something you have.
Say it!
I could easily get out of this...
but there's a chance
you could get very, very hurt!
Carl, we're next. Now remember,
what is this not gonna be?
-Another Minute Maid fiasco.
-Damn it, Carl!
Can I have the next one, please?
Thank you.
Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
That's us.
But this is a study
for identical twins.
That's right. $.
But you're not identical twins.
Damn it, Carl!
Oh, my good God.
Continuing the countdown of your
favorite meals.
Tonight, number three
Macaroni and cheese
You have to stop this now.
I will, but not tonight.
For dinner music, I thought we could
listen to that tape that you made me.
Oh, the mixed tape.
"The Way You Look Tonight" is on here.
Dance with me.
You are just the sweetest.
I love the way you look every night,
Chandler.
That's why I made you this tape.
Happy birthday!
-Thanks.
I was watching.
A couple of questions
You know that last move...
where that woman tripped you
and pinned you to the floor?
What would you do next?
She'd take the keys
and jam them in your..
No, no. What would you do next?
-Who, me, the attacker?
Did not work.
What?
No, it's okay.
They're my friends.
In fact, I was married to one of them.
You attacked your ex-wife?
Oh, no. No, no.
I tried.
But I couldn't.
That's why I'm here.
Maybe we could attack them together!
That's a no.
I am so, so, so, so sorry.
And I will cook
And are you kidding me?
Come on, Monica,
it's our Valentine's Day.
Please, please, please, please?
Okay.
-So are we going in there?
-I am!
Nowhere to run.
I don't like sitting up here.
-Danger!
Oh, my God!
Why is he jumping on those women?
We should help them.
I don't think they need any help.
I got my teacher evaluations.
Look what this student wrote.
"I loved Dr. Geller's class.
of the Paleontology Department."
"Hotties of Paleontology."
There's a big-selling calendar.
-Who wrote it?
-The evaluations are all anonymous.
-You have their exams?
and there's your admirer.
A hot girl's at stake
and he's Rain Man.
Wait a minute. Why are we
so sure that this is a girl?
It's a girl!
But it wouldn't matter.
Because I'm a teacher.
-It's frowned upon.
-And there's a big age gap.
-When you're ..
I know, she'll be  and it won't
seem like such a big difference.
That's not what I was gonna say.
When you're , you'll still have the
-I don't know.
You know your college friend
who became a movie director?
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone.
She was in my movement class.
-What's a movement class?
You gotta get me an audition.
I haven't talked to her in  years.
Please, Chandler,
I would owe you so much.
You do owe me so much.
You owe me ..
Hey, hey, dude. Why you changing
-Okay, I'll try.
Thanks. Last auditions are Thursday,
so I gotta get in by Thursday.
Remember Thursday.
Remember Thursday?
Yeah, so Tuesday?
Thursday!
Just think of it like this
When day, what day?
Thursday!
The third day, okay?
-Thank you.
-Okay.
-Hey, Monica..?
-She doesn't know.
-I'm gonna check my messages.
She wants to see who else did.
Hello?
Rachel.
Someone's in our apartment.
Call the cops!
You're on the phone!
-Oh, my God!
-What?
Oh, my God! Thank you!
There was a fire at our place.
-Oh, my God! How bad was it?
-Yeah, come on.
What are you smiling about?
The part I want to audition for is
a fireman. This is so meant to be!
You were very generous
with your grades this semester.
-Professor Geller?
-Oh, thank you. Thanks very much.
I'm a little embarrassed about
calling you a hottie.
-That was you?
-Yeah.
I felt a little weird about it.
the semester's over.
-You're not my teacher anymore.
-What time?
Oh, you know what? Forget it.
I see you already gave me an A.
-Gotcha.
-I'm kidding! God!
So seriously, what time?
Coming through. Coming through.
was contained to the bedrooms.
Hey, buddy, think I could borrow
your uniform this Thursday?
-Excuse me?
-Joey! He's working.
You would look good in that.
Oh, how bad is it?
It's really bad.
The only thing that isn't burned is an
-Everything's ruined.
My bed, my clothes.
Look at my favorite sweater.
Isn't that mine?
Fine. I'm sorry for your loss.
You won't be able to live here for
a while. You have a place to stay?
Oh! Wow!
Okay, look, pal...
I am not in the mood
I'll call you sometime.
Yes, they can stay with us.
Do you know what
started the fire, Mr. Fireman?
Well, do either of you smoke?
No. But yeah,
I could use one now. Thanks.
-Do you light candles, burn incense?
it's me! I burned down the house!
Okay, Phoebe, calm down.
There's no need to place blame. Okay?
I warned her about those candles.
I can't believe how long it's been.
Hey, Chandler, is that..?
-Oh, that's great, good for you.
-So, is it..?
Okay. So, yeah, maybe
We'll do it then. Okay, bye.
When's my audition?
I know it's Thursday, but what time?
Hi. We didn't get to it.
I'm taking her to coffee.
We'll do it then.
Now you're going on a date
and ask somebody for a favor.
There are rules, you know?
You gotta put in some time.
Right, I'm sorry.
-It's not like she's an ex-girlfriend.
-We only went out once.
You dated her?!
Not once.
Why don't I just go out with an ex,
Maybe you go out with Joey.
That's great. My friend Joey's
in the movie business.
You know who I ran into from school?
Howie.
My friend's name is Joey.
Apparently, Howie's editing now.
Yeah, he calls me up and asks me
in  years...
and he asks me for a favor?
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
No "How you doing?"
Man, I mean, not even
a cup of coffee first.
-The nerve.
-Yeah.
Refill?
This is last-minute, so I want
this way when I lived here.
I know!
But there's only room for one, so one
of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Since the fire was kind of my fault,
you should get to stay here.
Hey, hey, now. This was no one's
You should get the nice room.
Okay!
You're the first guest
at "Hotel Monica."
Hotel Monica!
Just tell me how you like your eggs.
I thought I'd bring them
to you in bed.
-You've been through so much.
I keep the pizza.
And that's where the napkin is.
-What's that smell?
-I know! I don't...
Oh, please, it was such a big class.
You never even noticed me.
What? Of course I did.
so I came up with nicknames.
The guy on the other side of you
was "Smelly Von Brown Shirt."
Oh, yeah.
-So did you have a nickname for me?
-No. No.
Yes, you did. What was it?
"Cutie McPretty."
Oh, that's so sweet!
Listen, I gotta tell you,
the whole student/teacher thing?
And to be frank,
I thought it would be too.
But it's not.
I mean, it's not at all.
-Dr. Geller!
-I did.
Monica was so sweet.
She left a little mint on my pillow.
Know what Joey left on my pillow?
Gum.
-We determined the cause of the fire.
-I know. It was my candle, my candle!
No, there was an appliance left on.
-Someone does.
Don't look at me, my hair's straight.
Straight, straight, straight.
-It could've been a hair straightener.
-Oh.
This is where I keep the pizza.
And..
to strain her eyes.
Thanks, Monica.
-Does that smell bother you?
-From Joey's?
I can hardly smell it over here.
Well, you let me know if you can.
I can bake a pie to cover it.
-I can smell it a little, bake a pie.
It's the fire inspector.
Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe.
Really?
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't
the hair straightener...
that started the fire.
No, no. It was the candles.
Yeah. It's very not good
leaving candles unattended.
In fact, one of the first things
She's incredible.
I thought the age difference might be
a problem, but it wasn't.
Elizabeth is very mature for her age.
A concept lost on some people.
It's okay to date a student?
Well, not really. Technically,
it's not against the rules.
But it's frowned upon, especially by
as "Professor McNails-his-students."
-Yeah. What should I do?
-Well, it seems pretty clear.
What's more important?
What people think or how you feel?
-You gotta follow your heart.
-Hey! So how'd it go with Dana?
Any reason I should leave a block
of time open? Say, Thursday?
-I couldn't do it.
-You couldn't do it?
I need more time.
-Dana Keystone, from college.
Oh, yeah. Wasn't she...?
No, that was Dana Kaplan.
Oh.
-Joey, you didn't even know her!
-Yeah, whatever.
Great story again.
The yarns that you weave!
You know, actually, I should get going.
Oh, no, no, stay!
Because you should stay.
Oh, I am really flattered.
But I just...
You know, you're such a sweet guy...
and I don't want to hurt you.
I wish I could do something
to make you feel better.
No.. Really?
Of course.
Well, it just hurts so bad, I...
Oh, I'm sorry.
-Maybe there is one thing you can do.
-What? Anything. Anything.
Well, I mean, this is just
This actor friend.
He would kill me if he knew
that I was doing this.
But...
would it be possible for him to
audition for your movie on Thursday?
Absolutely.
But...
you'd really feel better if your
in the last five minutes.
Yes, it has. I made cookies!
I'm still full from your
homemade potato chips.
But you should eat them now,
because they're hot from the oven.
Okay.
But not in here! Can't eat them
-This doesn't lock, does it?
-Oh! Joey, I'm sorry.
-It's all right, don't worry about it.
But look!
That's gonna leave a stain.
Rach, hey, it's fine.
-Yeah, look.
Yeah.
-I've never lived like this before.
-I know.
Well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food.
What do you want to do now?
-No, I have some turning  to do.
You know, I remember when I was
in college, we used to..
-What are you doing?
-Nothing, I'm so comfortable with you.
Do you not want to be seen with me?
No, of course I do. Are they gone?
No, they're still here.
Who cares what people think?
I mean, we like each other, right?
There's nothing wrong with that.
Come on.
Burt. Lydia. Mel.
-This is Elizabeth.
-Hi.
Aren't you in my popular culture
class?
That's right, Lydia.
-They'll fire you.
You can't date her.
It's against the rules.
Really? It's not just frowned upon?
I love it at Joey's!
-Nice!
-Thanks.
So you busy Thursday?
Oh, very funny. Remember?
Let's hug it up!
Okay, okay! What are you
gonna do to me if you get the part?
-Hey.
-Hi.
Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you.
I know they said the hair straightener
the tissues.
And so, let's face it,
that's just kindling.
So I think it's fair that
I stay at Joey's.
No, no, no, this was my fault.
-Besides, I'm fine here.
-Really?
-She said something about crumbies.
-No, no, no! I was so careful.
You have to switch with me.
Monica is driving me crazy.
That's right. All the ladies
wet paper towels here!
No, but at Monica's,
you can eat cookies over the sink.
I know. I'm sorry.
All right, fine.
This looks like so much fun.
God, what a mess.
Wow, it actually is in the handbook.
I can't date you or have
to stop seeing each other.
For what it's worth, I did appreciate
you standing up for me.
That felt really nice.
Kind of made me like you even more.
I know, I know. I really like
you too. But we can't date.
It's against the rules.
-What?
Just hearing you describe it
as "forbidden"...
it's really hot.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, I don't care how hot it is,
it's wrong.
-Stop it.
-So...?
It's Thursday!
How was the audition?
It's.. Monday, one day. Tuesday,
two day. Wednesday, what day..
Oh!
Well, that thing's clearly in the way.
All right.
Damn fridge!
-Hi, Joey. How you doing?
-I know.
Now that you bring it up,
our fridge is broken.
We need a new one.
I checked and your half is $.
Thanks a lot.
I'm not paying for that.
I'm just here while they fix my place.
Look, Rach, my parents bought this
Then you show up and it breaks!
What does that tell you?
That refrigerators don't live
as long as people?
You know the ATM
only lets you take out , so...
I'll take a check for the rest.
You're joking, right?
Of course I'm joking.
My good friend Joey over here.
I'm sorry. Thank you, Chandler.
There's a charity ball
and Ralph Lauren has a table...
so I have to go.
-What charity?
-I don't know.
Something, either trees or disease...
Ralph mumbles a lot.
-He mumbles when you're not attentive?
or the ability to rent a tux.
So he has to be a male
who has at least $.
So close.
-Hey, everybody!
-Hi, there.
-This is Elizabeth.
to have run into each other here.
This is...
Oh, sly!
I wanted to meet you guys,
but I have to run.
-See you later?
-Okay.
-Bye, Ross.
-That's quite all right, ma'am.
Bye.
Why is she leaving? Is it a
school night and she has homework?
Yes. Her molecular epidemiology paper
is due tomorrow.
Tell her good luck with that.
Anyone else? Bring them on.
-When's her birthday?
since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.
-I like Elizabeth.
-Well, thanks.
I like her so much, tell her
I want my cookies early this year.
A box of Thin Mints
Ross, how's it going with her?
It's been great.
She's , so she's not too serious,
which is perfect for me now.
That's great.
Seriously, she seems nice.
I know you guys like
-Okay, I got a good one.
What is she, like, ?
Chandler, do we talk about
our relationship enough?
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Okay.
I thought of the perfect guy
for Rachel to take to her thing.
That's so funny.
between my guy and your weirdo.
-Why would our guy be a weirdo?
-Because that's just your taste.
See, Rachel's not gonna pick
your stupid guy.
-Yeah?
who does volunteer work.
And he has one of these.
A face ass?
A chin dimple.
Well, you know, our guy works
with Chandler.
He's really nice and smart,
and he's a great dresser.
-Have you seen your guy's body?
He's a massage client.
And one time, when he was on the
table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
-You're not supposed to look.
-Like there are police for that.
You look? You massaged me.
I know.
Fine. Your guy may have a great body,
-My guy's well-read.
-Our guy has great hair.
-My guy has great teeth.
Our guy smells incredible.
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
Well, you don't look good, Joe.
The fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.
What was in that brown jar?
-That's still in there?
For our new fridge.
Our new fridge?
-I don't live here anymore.
-So what?
Look, okay, suppose we were
a divorced couple.
And I got custody of the kid. Right?
Now suppose the kid dies
could talk to you for a moment?
Yes, of course.
What would this be regarding?
Making out in your office.
Of course. Why don't we go inside.
-What?
-Doorknob.
Sorry.
I actually do need to talk to you.
What about?
-Spring vacation?
a lot of people are going on trips..
-Professor Geller.
-Yes, Professor Friesenstinlender.
I'll be with you in one moment.
So I will take one box
of the Thin Mints.
You don't understand. Elizabeth was
I'm not ready for this.
-What do I tell her?
-Tell her the truth, tell her you're not ready.
I could do that.
-What if she gets upset?
-Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Or you could just, you know, you...
What the hell are you doing?
What the hell am I doing?
what breaks my fridge?
Excuse me!
Well, what do you know?
Broken!
That'll be $.
Joey, I saw you push him.
You pushed him.
Joey, I did not break this. Okay?
That has been broken for a while.
Remember I told you about our fridge?
I still haven't gotten the check
for your half yet.
Do not give him any money!
I'm not talking to you!
-Yes. Please come in.
-Doorknob?
-Yeah. It kind of grows on you.
I wanted to finish
talking to you about spring vacation.
Good.
Look, I...
Look, I'm having
fast or put too much pressure on us.
So I'm sorry, I just don't think
we should go away together yet.
It's too soon.
Ross, I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.
I just wanted to tell you that I'm
what I was saying.
What I meant was..
You are so adorable.
That. Let's talk about that.
-Hi.
-Hi.
How did it go with Elizabeth?
Fine. Just a misunderstanding.
She didn't want me to go with her.
She just wanted to let me know
for spring vacation or spring break? Wahoo!
What's the difference?
Spring vacation, you're doing nice things
with your grandparents.
Spring break, you're doing frat guys.
You know what?
Not all spring breaks are like that.
-What did you do on yours?
"Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx, wahoo!"
I think Elizabeth is a little more
Come on, she's taking my class.
-And slept with the professor.
-I'm gonna call her.
You guys,
grabbed for the last Field and Stream.
What? I read that.
-Can I get you a cup of coffee?
-Yes. Thank you.
-Rachel, what the hell is this?
-What?
You ask us to find a guy, and you come
funny guy from Chandler's work.
Yeah, and I found you one too,
who is not a weirdo.
You know what though, guys,
I really appreciate that...
but I'm gonna take Sebastian.
Are you sure?
-Thank you.
So, Sebastian,
do you do any volunteer work?
-Not really. Why?
-No reason.
I know a single guy
-What are you guys doing?
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
I just wanted to have coffee
with Rachel.
Well, so do a lot of people.
-Actually, I gotta get going.
-But you..
-Give me a call sometime.
and he just left because of you!
Yeah, but "Sebastian"?
What is that, a cat's name?
You know what I noticed, Rachel?
He scares easy.
Is that the kind of guy you wanna take
Rachel, we're very sorry.
That is a very
insensitive thing to do.
Let us make it up to you.
We have two really great guys for you.
Yeah, what have you got to lose?
You might even end up with someone
-So you will meet our guys?
Yes.
It doesn't matter which one you choose.
It's up to you.
Our guy is perfect.
Or you could go out with the guy Phoebe
deemed not good enough for herself.
There you are!
-Really?
Technically, you owe me $
for sending out happy thoughts...
on your last  auditions.
Call it even?
Okay.
There you are.
What did Elizabeth say?
Turns out she is going to Daytona
for "spring break, wahoo."
That means wet T-shirt contests, guys
-I was there! Spring Break ', wahoo!
In , you were .
So? I drove down, sold T-shirts.
Had a blast.
You know who knows how to party?
Drunk college chicks.
Okay, she can't go.
You can't tell her not to go.
-You just have to be cool with it.
What if she goes down there and sleeps
with a bunch of guys?
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
I'm sorry, this is very serious.
And you know what, Ross?
You like her, she likes you,
I'm probably overreacting.
It's just she's staying at this party hotel
on the beach...
with a huge pool and free drinks
with every meal.
If she's got enough money for that, she
so hard this semester.
I really need to go crazy,
blow off some steam.
Sure.
Look, I don't know if your plans
are finalized yet, but...
I know a great way
-Are you into crafts at all?
Ross, are you okay?
Yeah. Of course I'm okay.
I'm just being supportive.
Supportive of you
and this whole trip...
and what's this?
It's a bathing suit?
To wear in front of people?
Is that supportive?
Is this?
Okay, good.
-Hey.
-Hi.
We're so glad you decided to
-I don't know.
-I don't work late tomorrow night.
-Tomorrow night is good.
But why put off something till
tomorrow that you could do it right now?
-Eldad, come here!
-How are you?
A little blindsided but good.
Eldad, sit down. Move over now.
There you go. There you are.
Okay, we can take a hint!
What? What are you doing here?
This is Patrick.
-Hi.
-Hi.
You're too late because
she's already with our guy.
You're right, I am too late.
-Hi.
This is the guy I was telling you about.
This suit does not do justice
to what's underneath it.
Okay.
But, Phoebe, I'm just sort of
in the middle of something.
Okay. That's okay. Have a seat.
-You can't do that!
Eldad's hair.
-He has the softest hair. Touch it.
-I'm good.
Rachel, Patrick is really rich.
Give her some money.
This isn't really worth the free massage.
-That's right. Bye-bye.
and he can dance.
You dance for Rachel.
Don't dance for me. Please!
What is the matter with you?
Yeah, let's talk it out.
Am I the only one that this is
embarrassing for?
I'm a little embarrassed.
I'll tell you who should
be embarrassed. It's you guys.
I do not need you
-I am still talking!
Then you chase away
the one guy I actually liked.
No offense to you guys.
Really, congratulations on...
all the cash.
And you really do have very soft hair.
But I'd much rather go to the ball by
special conditioner on that hair?
Papaya extract.
Thank you.
So have a great time down there.
-I will.
-Yeah.
-Did you pack that bathing suit?
-Yeah.
It was pretty funny
which I'm fine with.
I'm concerned about your health.
Sun exposure.
Don't worry, I have plenty of sun block.
-It's SPF .
-All right.
Well, if what's in the bottle
is actually .
Sometimes you get ,
to hook up with a bunch of guys.
I really like you.
I like how things are going between us.
-Really?
-Yeah.
I'm just going down there to relax
and hang out with my friends.
Okay. Cool.
Here they are!
Call me!
Sorry for pushing those guys on you.
That's all right.
raised a lot of money and awareness.
So, what was it for anyway?
I wanna say a disease.
I just got this really weird message
from Ross. He said to turn on MTV.
Oh, my God, look! That's Elizabeth!
Professor Geller.
To be  again....
"We've got  minutes till it blows.
We won't make it!"
"You've got to get out of here!
I'm a robot. I'm just a machine!"
-"No, you're not. Not to me."
-Oh, my God.
-What?
-I am extremely talented.
-Yeah. You're great.
-No, I mean, I was really acting my ass off.
I thought I was pretty good, too.
Yeah, you're solid. You're just no me.
You know what?
I think that's enough for now.
I don't want to be over-rehearsed.
Fine. I'll do it without you!
I don't need you or anybody else!
I'm gonna make it on my own!
You'll see! You'll all see!
The One With Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
So what are you auditioning for?
It's a new TV show.
I'm up for the part of Mac,
Machiavelli, or "Mac"!
I'm a detective and I solve crimes
secret enforcer.
Or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
-So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.?
-That's the title!
They lucked out
that the initials spell "cheese."
That is lucky.
So Joey, if you get this,
or the "Big Mac." Hey, you love those!
Don't get your hopes up.
It probably won't happen.
Why would you say that?
Well, I mean, come on, guys.
My own TV show?
-I don't know if I'm good enough.
You're a terrific actor.
-You really think so?
-How can you even ask that question?
-She's pretty.
-Yeah. And she's really nice too.
She taught me all about
-Excuse me?
It's like you got so many lines
to learn so fast...
sometimes you need time
to remember your next one.
So while you're thinking of it, you
your sister's surgeon.
You sister is suffering from a...
Well, Eva, we've done
some excellent work here.
And I would have to say
your problem is quite clear.
All you want is a tinkle
What you envy's a schwang
A thing through which you can tinkle
Or play with or simply let hang
I play Al Pacino's butt.
All right?
He goes into the shower and then,
-Come on, you guys.
This is a movie and Al Pacino's in it,
and that's big!
It's terrific. You deserve this.
After years of struggling...
you've finally cracked your way
This is a big break for me.
-No, you're right, it is.
-Yeah.
So, you gonna invite us
to the big opening?
All right, I'm out of here. Wish me luck.
Good luck, good luck
I'd be a triple threat.
It's your turn.
Oh, are we playing this?
How'd the audition go?
Terrible. I messed up every word.
I shouldn't even be an actor.
Wait. Are you pretending it didn't
go well, but it really did go well?
-Yeah, did I fool you?
-Amazingly well!
-Great!
-It's down to me and two other guys.
And they're really good.
One's from those allergy commercials
who's chased by flowers.
Oh, I love that guy!
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm so nervous, you know?
-Well, it is overdue.
-Don't worry. You'll be fine.
-But it's so much pressure.
What you guys do is different.
I don't know if you'd understand.
Yeah, we don't have pressure
at the wee-ness and I'm not happy.
Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.
-Is it dirty?
-Don't worry, I'll wash it.
Don't. I like it dirty.
That's your call.
So what are you going to do next?
I thought I'd cut up the tomatoes.
Are they firm?
-They're all right.
-You sure they haven't gone bad?
You sure they're not very, very bad?
-No, really. They're okay.
do them julienne.
I'm out of here.
I'm quitting. I just helped
an -year-old woman put on a thong...
and she didn't even buy it.
I'm quitting. That's it.
I'm talking to my boss right now.
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.
Bye. Call me when you
and everything was fine until...
Oh, my God.
And all of a sudden,
his hands weren't the problem anymore.
-Was it?
-Boy Scouts could've camped under there.
You ate my sandwich?
It was a mistake.
Some of it may still be in the trash.
-What?
-Well, it was quite large.
I had to throw most of it away.
You threw my sandwich away?
My sandwich?
My sandwich!
It's just, I want this part so much.
If I don't get this part, I'm never gonna eat
macaroni and cheese again.
I didn't say that. That doesn't count.
Come on, guys.
Can I take a message?
Yeah, okay. So the audition's
Okay, great. Bye.
-Aren't you dressed yet?
-Am I naked again?
We're meeting my parents
Look at them.
Is it okay if they come visit?
What about my allergies?
Right. Your allergies.
All her. She hates you.
Yes! All right.
How cool would it be if you could watch
a life-size version of this?
-I mean, how crazy would that be?
-As crazy as soccer?
Hello?
What are you talking about?
-Maybe we can fix it.
Maybe we can send him
some big flowers and scare him!
How could you do this? This could've
turned my career around.
I messed up, okay?
-Which I bought for you.
Taught you how to use it.
You thought it was a copier.
If there was anything I could do,
I'd do it.
Everybody's allowed
or golf clubs.
But no, he has to get me
the "Woman Repeller."
The eyesore from
the "Liberace House of Crap!"
-It's not that bad.
from the "Mr. T" collection.
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry!
I do! I do!
I pity the fool that...
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I were talking and...
one thing led to another and....
And what? Did you sleep with her?
-No! No, I just kissed her.
-I don't know! But it's the same!
I have no excuses.
I was over the line.
Over the line?
You're so far past the line
you can't even see it!
The line is a dot to you!
I'm not saying you should
You've made errors in judgment.
Name one!
What happened?
Man! He promised
he wouldn't take the chairs!
How were you locked in?
And where the hell's all of our stuff?
This guy came to look at the unit...
and he didn't think
know what I'll do?
Bend over?
There's Lori.
Remember, no trading.
You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
-Hi, Joey.
-Hey.
Well, well. Look what you brought.
And what did you bring?
She's checking her coat.
Joey, I'm gonna go wash
and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?
Oh, my God!
Joey's tailor took advantage of me.
What?
No way. I've been going
to the guy for  years.
You said he'd do my inseam...
then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was...
What?
Cupping.
That's how they do pants!
-Isn't that how a tailor measures?
-Stop beating yourself up.
People make mistakes.
These things happen.
There aren't any messages
you've forgotten to give me?
Apparently, you're not very good at it.
-Do you think he'll forgive me?
is that you forgive yourself.
-You know what, I kind of have.
-Already?
That was pretty bad what you did.
He will forgive you.
I like to bring a pad with me when
I answer the phone, okay?
-You didn't see how mad he was.
you make up. That's how it works.
It took two people to break up
this relationship!
Yeah! You and that copy girl...
which yesterday you took
responsibility for!
I didn't know what I was taking
-What?
-I fell asleep.
-You fell asleep?
And you had rambled on for  pages.
Front and back!
And by the way?
Y-O-U, apostrophe R-E means, "you are."
Y-O-U-R means "your."
I can't believe I thought
it's not that common...
it doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal!
I knew it!
-You had no right to go out with him.
-That's ridiculous..
-You sold me out!
-Would you let me talk?
Did you just flick me?
Well, you wouldn't let me finish and..
Stop it!
-Stop.
-Stop.
-All right. No, let's not do this.
-No!
-Happy thoughts.
-No!
Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass!
All right. Now, I will let go
if you both stop.
-Fine.
-Fine.
There we go.
You know what? If we were in prison,
I'm wearing everything you own.
Oh, my God!
Look at me, I'm Chandler!
Could I be wearing any more clothes?
Maybe if I wasn't going commando.
I tell you, it's hot with all this on.
I'd better not do any lunges.
Joey?
Got you the Joey special! Two pizzas!
Hello? Damn it!
Hello?
No, Joey's not here right now,
That's great news!
Well, no, obviously not for the actor
who was mauled by his dog.
That's great.
I'll give Joey the message.
Yes!
Okay.
Mac...
audition...
at :.
Allergy...
actor...
attacked.
By dog...
not...
flowers.
-Tell me you got the message.
They needed you at .
What? It's !
Look! I wrote it on the board!
I wrote it down,
then went looking for you!
I went to Ross's, the coffee house...
I went to any place
they make sandwiches!
-I can't believe this, Chandler!
-You might say congratulations!
I saw the board, I went to the audition,
I got the part!
Was that funny? I was worried.
-I'm sorry.
-That fake-out thing is just mean.
Oh, I'm sorry.
And I'm incredibly happy for you!
That's mean!
-You had me going!
-We could do this all day.
Yeah, you're right.
Let's talk about what a huge star
I'm gonna be.
You're gonna be huge!
-All right.
-Do we do this too much?
-I think so.
-Yeah. Get off me.
-Yeah.
"C.H.E.E.S.E.,
through your CPU."
"l can't! My circuits are fried!
They're fried, I tell you!"
"Then I'll carry you!"
"That'll be a neat trick..."
"when you're dead!"
You don't have to yell.
There was just an explosion.
My hearing would be impaired.
I thought you were great.
For a minute, I was like,
where you meet Mac...
-Yeah?
-Oh, my God. I mean...
And you know what?
That's enough for today.
Thanks for your help.
-Holding us back.
-Okay.
And your horoscope says
"On the th, a special
someone will give you a gift."
Well, thank you in advance.
"But the th brings a lover's spat."
You're going to make fun
of my present.
Why would you do that?
Wait. "On the th,
-Hey.
It's Joey Tribbiani
of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
That's right. It's your first day.
Are you psyched to fight crime
with your robot sidekick?
Am I?
I know nothing about technology.
I can't even use Chandler's computer,
except to find porn.
And that's only because
it's there when you turn it on.
Our spat will start early this month.
I'll be waiting.
The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad
Are you judging them by their covers?
going to write another book.
Because the last one
was such a big seller?
If you must know,
I have written  books.
And as I'm the only one
they have been well received.
But I lost all of them in the fire.
So this one I'm gonna keep in an
asbestos-lined box far away from Rachel.
Who I forgive.
What are you doing later?
Rachel and I have to get our hair cut.
-We do?
-I wanna see what he wants.
Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Wait a minute. Hold the phone.
You're not Elizabeth's dad?
That's the only one you get.
And he hates me.
He asked Elizabeth why she'd want
this guy to like me.
It would really help if you guys
could make me look good.
-Of course we'll help.
-Thanks.
We know how tough those
-Wow!
Mac Machiavelli, private investigator.
Look at all the books I've read.
Let's get you to wardrobe.
When do I meet the robot?
Right now. He's right here.
Joey Tribbiani, this is..
Wow! He's so lifelike.
Unbelievable.
This is Wayne, the man who created
and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
How do you do there, buddy?
I'll let you two guys get acquainted.
Sorry about that.
-So where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
-C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
Nice to meet you, Mac.
-This is the temporary robot, right?
a really cool robot.
Like the Terminator,
or when I first saw you.
I spent two years developing this.
It's state of the art.
Sorry. It doesn't look like
Dad, this is Ross Geller.
It's great to meet you, Paul.
I prefer that Liz's boyfriends
address me as Mr. Stevens.
Of course. Mr. Stevens.
So, Ross...
what's your problem?
Excuse me?
Why can't you get a girlfriend
your own age?
It's funny...
It's not funny.
I don't like you going out
I can change your mind.
-Okay.
-What?
Okay. I'll give you one chance
to change my mind.
You've got one minute.
-Daddy.
never done anything like this before.
I mean, I've been in relationships
in general.
But I've never done it with a student.
I mean, not...
Not "it." We haven't done "it."
I mean, we've done stuff...
Okay. A joke. Lighten the mood.
Two guys go into a bar.
-And the Irish guy wins the joke.
Ross! How crazy
that we would run into you.
Oh, my God! Thank you.
I'd like you to meet my friends.
This is Phoebe, Monica and Chandler.
-Phoebe.
-Hi.
Chunder.
-Chandler.
-Never going to remember that.
You're Elizabeth's dad?
I see where she gets her...
rugged handsomeness.
Is there a Mrs. Stevens?
There's a Mr. Bing!
Unfortunately, Lizzie's mom passed
whatever you want.
Whatever pops into your head.
It is strange seeing Ross here,
this time of day...
because usually
he's at the children's hospital.
But not looking for dates.
Monica is Ross's sister.
He's a great brother!
I had a sister.
She passed away.
You don't have to do that every time.
But Ross is a great guy.
didn't he?
A part of him did, yes.
Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.
I hope you guys are finding
something to talk about.
-Yes. We were just..
-Sorry I'm late.
But I am ready to talk you up.
-When does Liz's father get here?
How's the book writing going?
Really well. I'm up to page .
-Wow! What are you writing?
-Page numbers.
Honey, you got the kind
with the little girl.
You said you'd buy the kind
-The little girl does.
-You said the baby.
-Why would a baby creep me out?
Why would the little girl
creep you out?
Can you please talk a little slower?
-This is for your book?
what not to do.
Keep going. This stuff's great.
Excuse me.
And how none of it matters when
the people really love each other.
And how people will believe anything
as long as it's a compliment.
-Oh, hi!
-Well, let's look for them.
Hey, look! Are these them?
No.
All right.
-Here they are.
-Good.
-Thanks for your help.
-Wait! Sorry!
-Mr. Paul?
I just wanted you to know that...
Ross really is a great guy.
Maybe you could date him. It'd
save me the trouble of killing him.
Are you okay?
You don't look old enough
to have a -year-old daughter.
Well, we were very young
-It usually takes two people to...
Oh, no! Yes! Of course. I know that!
What I meant was are you still "we"
or are you just you?
I'm just me.
My wife died shortly after
Lizzie was born.
So you raised her all on your own?
Yes, I did.
-What are you writing there?
with some clothes and a head.
How was your first day?
Pretty good. Except I got
attitude from the robot.
Damn those robots. They're supposed
to be our faithful servants!
It was the guy who controls the robot.
He hates me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E.
But I'm the star, you know?
There's a limit to how many sandwiches
I can eat off the floor.
Excuse me.
Joey Tribbiani.
Joe! I'm glad I found you!
I got an audition for you.
But it's kind of on the q.t.
The actor who has the part
I didn't even see you.
You did. You came in, got all awkward
and ran to the bedroom.
You were shouting, "Joey!"
-Bye, Rachel.
-Bye.
I'll call you later.
-See you.
So he was looking for them.
In your mouth?
No!
Downstairs. And we got to talking...
for two hours. I liked him.
I invited him for coffee.
You were at the coffeehouse!
What's the big deal?
So I kissed the guy.
He is my girlfriend's father.
-That was different!
-What? Why?
-This is weird for me!
Ross, look. This is good for you.
Let's face it.
So far the guy's not loving you.
But I can turn that around.
And I could talk you up.
Plus the guy
is a very successful lawyer.
-How is that important?
-It's important!
There's a million guys
I didn't know he could get me fired.
-What am I gonna do?
-You're a pretty charming guy.
Thanks. But I have a problem
to deal with.
No, you've got to win over
and kiss some serious robot ass!
That's not a bad idea!
If I have to be charming tomorrow,
I'm not wasting it on you guys.
I got some saved for you, Phoebe.
Do you think Joey is
more charming than me?
Yeah. That's why I'm sleeping
I'm writing about other people.
-Who?
-Marsha and Chester.
Fine. Then you know what?
I will just write about Phyllis.
-"Phyllis is sitting in the chair."
and it is bitter!
Morning!
How's my favorite genius
and his robot?
-Don't touch him!
-Okay.
Level with me. I keep hearing
for my part.
Come on. You gotta give me
a second chance.
I love this little guy.
That's why you didn't want me
to touch him, right?
I can't believe it. God!
Hey, how are you doing?
So it seemed that my prom date
to take a young girl to her prom.
I definitely did not see
that one backfiring.
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-Take your time.
I was a freshman and she was a senior.
a lot of jabs.
It's partly because
I'm very protective of Lizzie...
and partly because
they just keep coming to me.
I admit after all the
that Rachel has told me...
well...
you're not...
all bad.
"Not all bad."
I'm sorry I was so harsh.
But you have to understand.
I still look at Lizzie
like she's a -year-old girl.
I know what you mean. I do that too.
-I beg your pardon?
and I still think of him as a baby.
-A son?
-My ex-wife and I share custody of Ben.
Incidentally, Carol and I
are on excellent terms...
as I'm sure you are with your wife.
I'm sorry.
It's unbelievable!
Don't worry. I didn't realize
You were talking about Emily.
We said we would meet
would be if I said the sentence,
"Let's meet at :, not at :."
If I had said :, I would have said:
"My boyfriend is such a
-Oh, my good God!
-I know what time you said.
-What?
Well, I know what time
Chester and Marsha said.
What time?
Interesting turn of events.
Suddenly it's my book to the rescue.
me for writing my book.
Thank you for writing your book.
It's a great book...
and you are the
queen of everything.
Thanks. So are you.
I told you I should
planning on seeing a movie Sunday.
"Marsha thinks they're meeting at
-You knew we were gonna miss the movie?
-Right.
Instead of telling us, you decided
are mad at Phyllis."
I can't believe
I'm gonna lose this job.
I'm so sorry, man.
Is there anything I can do?
Help me get this mini-fridge
-Hi.
I'll get you your job back
if you help me out.
Why should I help you out?
-The reason he just said.
-What do you need?
I saw you on stage talking
I wish I could talk to her.
-Are you in love with her?
-Yeah.
Her. All of them. Anyone.
Yeah. I've been there, my friend.
Listen, I guarantee you
keep your job...
if you can teach me to talk
It's something you're born with.
You can teach it.
I can show you right now.
-Really?
-Sure. Yeah. I taught him.
Yeah. You should see the woman I'm with,
from each marriage.
How to make the next one even shorter?
Wait a minute. That's not fair.
He was married to me a hell of a lot
longer than he was to Emily.
He just didn't tell me.
Maybe I have to pee again.
Well, this is fun.
So, Ross, did you kill any
of these wives?
I have had enough of this! I
-God, no.
You know what?
If you don't like Ross, that's fine.
It doesn't matter.
I'm going out with him anyway.
Really?
Well, if it doesn't matter to her...
it doesn't matter to me.
about myself right now either.
-Then we agree?
-I guess so.
-Neither of us like Ross.
-I like Ross.
Kids!
I just thought of a story
We're not liking Ross right now.
Well, I got a lot of those too.
You were right, C.H.E.E.S.E.
-The shipment never made it to Omaha?
-You got it.
And the rabbi's beard?
 percent horsehair.
Nice catch, C.H.E.E.S.E.
It's your line, C.H.E.E.S.E.
Wayne! Wayne!
Hi, you guys.
What's the matter?
Well, it's just.. It's one of these
at the Morgan Chase Museum.
Now you're thinking
you gotta sleep with him.
No. No. It's just that he gave me
three tickets and there are six of us.
-I'll give up my ticket.
-Yeah.
So what is the exhibit?
It's mostly just photographs...
of lesbian love scenes interspersed
with video games and free sandwiches.
Oh, man!
-Hi.
-Hi.
Hey, Ross, listen.
Chandler got you out of going to the
Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
-That's great!
-Yeah.
Think about all the money
that you're gonna make.
Why? What?
Well, her father pays you
But maybe it's time to move on.
You know, let it go. Stop it!
Besides, Rachel's going out
with Elizabeth's father...
so he's much older than she is.
Looks like I'm not the only one
interested in fossils.
All that does is remind us
sweet nothings in his ear.
-Ross?
-Come on! That's funny.
Because he's gonna..
He's got, like, a hearing aid.
Because he's all old.
One second.
Okay, look, Ross.
Just so you know,
that you're dating her.
Really? That's great.
Yeah, but then I changed my mind.
I'm funny like that.
So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you.
I don't want you
seeing my daughter anymore.
Look, I realize it upsets you.
Yes, it does.
But Elizabeth and I are both adults...
so I don't think there's
anything you can do about it.
I'll tell the university about
back up on the wall of fame.
He's got all the big actors.
It was so cool when I was up there.
Me and Jim Belushi would just be
cracking up about something.
I get fired off Days of Our Lives
and he takes me down.
Now he's just laughing at me.
Look at him.
your picture back up...
they could put you by Matt Lauer.
Look at him just smiling at me.
Yeah, I know.
We'd be great together.
-So I'm back.
-Who are you?
Joey Tribbiani.
From the wall?
Okay, maybe this
I'm the star of a new TV show.
-Show me in the TV book.
-It's not on TV yet.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Okay, fine. I will bring you a tape.
So, now, do you have any
of Matt Lauer's clothes?
Maybe? Just ones that
-Yeah.
-Where do you want to start?
-The gift shop!
-And then lunch.
-Yes, but I can't eat too much.
Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight.
he's gonna tell you he's gay?
What? No, why?
No reason. That would just be
a really big surprise, right?
You could put the aisle over here
and have the wedding ceremony over here.
I didn't know you could get married here.
This would be a beautiful place
And I would never have the ceremony there.
You'd have the ceremony
under a beautiful arch.
May I help you?
Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.
It's just such a beautiful space.
-Do you do a lot of weddings?
Sorry.
Monica, you should put
your name down for this place.
What? Are you crazy?
I'm not getting married.
I'm not even engaged.
But there's a two-year wait.
another two years?
That's four years.
Chandler's not gonna wait that long.
He's gonna find somebody else.
Someone who did put their name
on the list.
It can't hurt to put your name down.
If, in two years, you're not engaged,
in putting my name down.
I'm gonna do it too.
Me too!
-Really? Who would you marry?
-I don't have anyone right now.
Oh, Phoebe.
Don't feel too sorry for me.
At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
Phoebe, that's not..
Don't even get me started on yours.
-Did you watch the tape of my show?
-You don't go up on the wall.
-What? But you saw the show.
-lt was very offensive to my people.
Dry cleaners?
Russians. It showed them
as terrorists and villains.
Okay, okay.
Mr. Ford is a very good customer.
He brings us a lot of clothes.
You bring nothing!
Okay, that may be true.
But in Air Force One, okay,
the Russians were terrorists and evil!
And plus, he kills a bunch of them.
-You should. It's great!
This place is really beautiful.
I've been coming here since I was
a kid. This used to be my grandma's.
The only thing I got
from my grandmother was her eyes.
I mean, not her actual eyeballs.
But people say that my eyes look...
Do you wanna make out?
Sure.
Are you okay?
What's wrong?
Yeah. I was just thinking
from one more person.
Big deal.
Besides, we've had fun hiding it.
Yeah.
-Yeah?
-You brought protection, right?
Why, are there, like, bears or something?
Protection. Yeah. No, yeah.
That.. That I forgot.
I can't believe I brought two cans
-I'm the guy. I'll get it.
-Do you know where the store is?
-No.
Do you wanna ride around town
on my little pink bicycle?
A little bit.
I'll be back in  minutes. Get in
This is such a beautiful house!
Thank you. It used to be my mother's.
This is the kitchen.
-Hey, Chandler.
-Hey, Joe.
Everybody's gotta be doing something.
You've reached Monica and Chandler's.
If you're listening to this message,
from the Morgan Chase Museum.
I'm calling for Monica Geller. I wanted to
let her know that there was a cancellation.
If she's still interested in having the
Bing-Geller wedding in our facility...
...it is available..
This is Chandler Bing!
in the world.
Sorry.
What's the matter, honey?
-Did you see a little mouse?
-No! Big bear! Big bear outside!
I think I..
-Actually, would you go check on that?
-We don't have any bears here.
Well, okay.
Would you get me a Diet Coke?
-Okay. Be right back.
-What are you doing here?
-I came with Paul!
-Yeah. I recognized the ankles.
-Where is Elizabeth?
-She's at the store.
-You make the girl go to the store?
-Diet Coke.
Ice.
I need ice.
Okay.
-Thank you.
-Be right back.
Okay.
You and your ice.
Get out! Get out! Go! Come on!
No, not in there! Not in there!
He's in there!
-Did you really hear a bear?
-Elizabeth!
Look! Elizabeth's here!
Who were you talking to?
You guys?
How did you know we were here?
She obviously saw the tire tracks
leading up to the closed garage.
Obviously.
What are you doing here?
Did you come up here to work on
that term paper or something?
Yeah.
Well, why don't you go in that room
That's my dad's bedroom.
That's your dad's bedroom.
That's your dad's bedroom!
Why are you yelling?
That Diet Coke, I think,
just straight to my head!
Hi, honey.
See you later.
Wait. I bought groceries.
I was gonna make you dinner.
Well, next time, ask!
Or at least wait for me to ask!
Hi, this is Hildy
-Oh, no.
I wanted to let her know
that there was a cancellation.
If she's still interested in having
the Bing-Geller wedding in our facility...
it is available....
Please. He didn't hear it!
This is Chandler Bing!
whose pictures go up on the wall?
-He's not here right now.
-You're kidding me!
Make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani
stopped by to drop off all these clothes.
I'm an actor. I'm trying to get
who could get your picture up there.
Oh, really?
Well, maybe you and I go out
for drinks.
You're the other one, right?
So, Lizzie, are you planning on
staying the night?
No, no. Believe me,
to stay. Obviously, you're welcome.
How much more homework
do you have?
I just have one problem left
that I do not know how to solve.
Rachel, maybe you wanna come
from the car.
What do you need from the car?
Surprise me.
Okay.
So you're gonna be in the car!
I will be upstairs!
That's where everybody's gonna be!
Just relax. Relax, Paul.
You're doing great.
She likes you.
I think she likes you. She likes you.
You know why?
-Yeah?
-Have you seen Chandler?
-No, why?
The museum called and said
that there was a cancellation...
and that we could move up our
With Chandler, oh, dear God!
I know! And he totally freaked out.
I can't find him anywhere!
-What are you gonna do?
-I'm never going to listen to you again.
"What harm can it do
-Well, Rachel's not here!
You really think she put
your picture up already?
Did she put my picture up?
You kidding, after the date we had?
I wouldn't be surprised if she put
 of my pictures up there.
Except for the fact that I only gave her one.
"son of a bitch"?
-I didn't do that. Who would do that?
-Son of a bitch!
Okay. Maybe ask this guy.
-You! Get out of my shop!
-What did he do?
-He went out with my wife!
I'm pointing at her.
"Zelda McMurray."
Who the hell..?
How did she get up there?!
Get out!
-Well, we should go.
-Yeah.
Ross?
Elizabeth!
Okay. I'm gonna go out this window.
I'll meet you at the front door.
-Wait! No, don't go in there!
Don't go in there!
I need another soda!
Ross!
Oh, my God, Ross!
What in heaven's name are you doing here?
And that is why
to have a little talk.
-Daddy, I..
-You're next!
Okay. I didn't know he was here.
Let me just see if I got this straight.
I tell you to stay away from
my daughter or I'll have you fired.
What you heard was:
and ruin my weekend with Rachel."
-Please, Paul. Just let me explain.
-No! Let me explain! Fired!
Okay, fine. Fine. Have me fired.
But I want you to know...
that you and I are not
all that different. I mean...
I, too, am a "neat guy."
What?
And I, too...
am "just a love machine."
-Let me show you the guest room.
Please stop freaking out.
I'm not freaking out.
Why would I? A woman named Hildy called
and said we were getting married.
But that happens every day.
Honey, we were at
this beautiful place...
and I just put our names down for fun.
-I mean, what's the harm in that?
to pressure you.
-Phoebe and Rachel thought..
-Phoebe and Rachel?
So the people that knew about
our wedding before me were you...
Phoebe and Rachel, Hildy, and some
anything, because it doesn't.
Okay.
Really?
Yes. If it really doesn't mean anything,
because you know I'm not ready.
I know.
I know.
Okay.
All right.
I'm gonna go tell Joey
that you're back.
We were really worried about you.
And that guy that
some sort of connection.
Did she buy it?
Totally.
-So did Hildy show you the place?
-Yeah. It's beautiful.
I can't believe
you're gonna ask Monica to marry you.
I know.
-Hey, Gunther.
for a cup of coffee.
Do you still work here?
No. I quit a long time ago.
Did I forget to tell you that?
I'm sorry.
-Cool. I was gonna fire you anyway.
-Great!
Can you help me pick
Tiffany cut or a princess cut or a..?
Paper cut!
-Have you told anyone else?
-No, I don't want Monica to find out.
You told me.
Because I trust you
and we're friends...
and you saw me looking
-Me too.
Let me see. Is there such a thing
as a Monica cut?
Because that would be you best bet.
-Want to go to the coffeehouse?
-Oh, all right.
We were just gonna see
we got the other place.
How rude.
Sorry. Want a bite?
The One With The Ring
So how are things going with Paul?
Good.
Although, you know,
he's a private guy.
I wish I could get him to open up,
share some feelings.
You just have to think of him
and bang his head against a table?
That's what you do when you want
to get the truth out of someone.
-Watch this.
-Okay.
-Hey, Paul.
-Hi.
-Great to..
-Ross, good to see you too.
You take care.
What was the deal with you
and Chandler blowing us off before?
That was so weird, huh?
Why did you do it?
I didn't do it. It was Chandler.
He's mad at you.
-What? Why?
Dig a little deeper.
Is it because Joey and I didn't
invite him to that Knicks game?
Is that something
he'd be mad at you for?
-I guess it could.
I wish he'd just tell me the truth.
You should run him under hot water
and bang his head against the table.
Honey, I made a reservation
at China Garden. Is that okay?
Yeah, that's great.
But first, talk to me.
really fine in that dress.
Yeah, that's great, Paul.
But, you know....
I want to know what..
Wow, those are really great!
I just want to know...
what is behind this strong,
and I want to swim in yours.
Are you talking about having sex?
No, Paul.
I don't know anything about you.
Tell me about your childhood.
Normal.
Then how about puberty? Come on!
That's always a painful time.
Your friends have a slumber party
in your sleeping bag.
No, that never happened to me.
You're lucky you never
met that bitch, Sharon Majeski.
Anyway...
The rest of your life. Any regrets?
Nope.
I'm not asking for a lot here.
Just give me something. Anything.
-Okay.
-Okay.
When I was  years old,
got me this little...
plastic chicken
that you hop around on.
It was embarrassing.
Kids made fun of me.
That was a tough year.
That's great! See?
I already feel like I know you
Now we can go eat. Let's go!
It was horrible.
They called me "Chicken Boy."
In fifth grade, I got in a fight.
Well, not really.
Richard Danville bit me.
I still have a little scar right here.
You can see it.
Yeah, yeah. I see the scar.
I think this is really great that,
It's beautiful.
But what do you say we
go share some food?
No, I couldn't eat now.
What are you talking about?
You love their Kung Pao chicken!
Chicken?
-Chicken Boy!
and I can't find the perfect ring.
Ugly ring, ugly ring, ugly ring...
It's a beautiful selection.
So maybe you don't get her a ring.
Maybe you do something different.
An engagement bracelet
or an engagement tiara!
An engagement Revolutionary War musket!
I'm so glad I picked you
piece of weaponry?
I'll stick with the ring.
This one's nice. I like it. Sir?
Kind sir, can I see this one?
This is why you brought me.
I know how to haggle.
-Let me handle this from here.
-Can I help you?
-I would like to see that ring.
with sapphires.
Sir, could I ask you...?
Could you hold out that ring
and ask me to marry you?
-Okay.
-Okay.
Will you marry me?
Oh, my God, that's it!
-I will handle this.
How much is it?
$.
We will give you $.
-Are you interested in this ring?
-Yes.
But I can only pay $.
-Okay. I can let it go for .
-We stand firm at $.
-How would you like to pay?
to Joey.
I'll go get it.
You guard the ring.
-Why did you give your credit card to Joey?
-To buy some Knicks tickets.
Then the jerk didn't even invite me
rather beautiful...
five-dollar bills.
I'll give you $ for them.
Remember how Chandler
and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
No.
-Remember, you were eating pizza?
-Yeah.
Chandler's angry at us for not getting
That guy's always mooching off of us.
Anyway, I still think we should
try to patch things up.
We could get tickets to another
game and invite him.
That's a great idea.
Here you go.
Sometimes I just don't get Chandler.
We do stuff all the time without you,
and you don't get all upset.
-All the time?
-All the time.
I'm sorry, it was rejected.
That's impossible. Let me see that.
This one's mine. Here you go.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Still crying?
I was gonna unleash...
this weepy, clingy,
moist monster!
I only know of two ways to shut
a man up. One of them is sex.
-What's the other?
he's not talking.
That's right. You're the talker.
Anyway, great idea.
I gotta buy him some more tissues.
-We have some here.
-No, you don't!
Okay. I'd also like
to try on the tiara.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
What do you think? Too much?
A tad.
Take the tiara back...
and let me hold the musket again.
Something's missing.
Let me see the ring that
-I just sold it to that gentleman.
Oh, my God!
Wait, no!
Let me out! Now!
Rachel?
No.
-How are you, Paul?
-Okay.
Chandler...
-did your dad ever hug you?
-No. Did he hug you?
No! No.
It's just that my dad never did.
I miss my dad.
You can see my dad in Vegas
-Yeah?
Would you...?
Would you hug me?
-I'm a little busy here, Paul.
-That's what my dad used to say.
Okay. A quick one.
Come on, hug it out.
There you go.
Okay.
-Five more seconds..
-What? Hey, what..?
Hi. Paul, is it?
-Do you have my credit card?
-Yeah. It's in my...
In my pocket.
-My back pocket!
-Thank God.
-I got tickets to the Knicks tonight.
Paul, probably.
Look, I don't have time for this, okay?
I gotta go.
That was mean.
Yeah, I know.
-Get in here.
-Yeah.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
I'm gonna go with
you picked is gone. It's over!
What?
Some guy bought it. I tried to stop
him, but they put me in jail!
-They put you in jail?
-The little jail between the doors!
-I asked you to guard the ring!
never saw the other ring.
Yeah, but when he proposed to me
with the ring, I got goosebumps.
-Maybe it was the guy.
-It was the ring!
-Was he excited about the tickets?
-I know.
I can't believe it.
Can I tell you something?
I'm a little mad at him now!
Can I tell you something?
Me too!
He didn't want to talk to us
about being angry.
Maybe we don't talk to him at all!
-Freeze him out.
-Right!
-I like it.
Joey and Ross, best friends.
We'll be the new Joey and Chandler.
What?
You think you and Chandler
were closer than me and Chandler?
Hey, don't get angry.
We turn on each other, he wins.
Hi, I'm back.
I've written down more to tell you!
Oh, that's great.
No, actually, that's...
That's great. That's really great.
You know, I gotta tell you, writing,
all that writing, it gets me...
It gets me kind of hot.
Wait, wait. Listen to this
Know what I wanted to be at that age?
A lover?
-A surfer.
-Hold on.
Let me just get
a little more comfortable here.
Wait a second.
-This isn't too revealing, is it?
-No.
Whatever happened to that little dude?
So full of dreams.
I don't care about the little dude!
I can't! I cannot listen
is a mental health professional!
That's only because
they get $ an hour!
Do you know how much money I could
have made listening to you? $!
Know when I figured that out?
to stifle me when  hours ago...
we figured out that's what
my mother was trying to do!
I'm sorry.
I don't mean...
I didn't mean to stifle you.
This is all just
when those gates open...
it's hard to close them.
But they are closed now. Believe me.
I'm so glad. I'm so glad you shared.
And I'm glad that you're done.
So what do you say we....
I'd like that.
That was so good!
Oh, oh.
I can't believe you talked me into
this gumball-machine-looking ring.
It's not a gumball-machine-looking ring.
It's a beautiful ring!
No, it's not.
When I looked at the other ring,
Looking at this, I only see a ring.
Unless I look at it really closely,
and then I can see my own eye.
This is the most important thing I'll
ever do. I want to make it perfect.
Maybe we could get
the guy was gonna propose.
-Maybe we could get him to trade rings.
-I can't do that.
You certainly can't give her
that stupid gumball ring.
-All right. Where was he going?
-Rainbow Room?
Rainbow Grill?
Somewhere Over the...?
-L'Espace.
-Rainbow L'Espace!
No, just L'Espace.
I'd love to know how you got
from rainbow to L'Espace.
No, you wouldn't.
You don't wanna get in here.
There he is.
He hasn't proposed yet.
After this, we should solve crimes.
Okay. Go get him.
Oh, okay.
Excuse me. Could you
come with me? You have a phone call.
-Who is it?
-It's your office.
-Do you know who at my office?
-Hi. Okay.
There was a mix-up at the store.
The ring you have was supposed
to be held for me.
I'm gonna need to have that back.
In exchange, I'm willing to trade you
this beautiful, more expensive ring.
Wow, I would trade.
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use
and her heart was set on that ring.
Do you want to break her heart?
Yeah. Do you want to break
a dying woman's heart?
You're dying?
Yeah, she's dying...
of a cough, apparently.
It's my dying wish to have that ring.
If I'm not buried with it...
my spirit will wander
-Great. Okay, here.
-All right, I'll do it.
-Thank you.
And you are about to marry
a wonderful man.
Hey, I'm marrying a dead woman!
Guys?
I've got something important
Come here!
And we're gonna be friends again.
What?
-Water under the bridge! Forget it!
-Okay.
I was gonna wait till it was official,
but I had to tell you guys.
You're my best friends.
-I can't believe this.
with you about your intentions.
I think I'm gonna cry.
Oh! No more crying!
I just dumped one crybaby.
I'll dump you too.
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, Chandler!
You guys are gonna be so happy!
-I know.
-Oh, nice. One and a half carat, easy.
-Hey.
-Hey, Phoebe.
-He's gonna ask Monica to marry him.
-I helped pick out the ring.
You told her before you told us?
She walked in while I was looking at
was so beautiful.
You should know.
You've bought like a billion of them.
Humor based on my pain.
You know what's funny?
Of all of your wives,
I'm the only one who never got a ring.
This a big issue for you?
No, but it would have been nice
and the hangover.
Ross is obviously
not gonna get you a ring.
But ask for a musket.
Ask for a musket!
When we were married,
Big surprise.
Get me a musket and we'll talk.
God, that is the most beautiful
engagement ring ever!
You should know.
You bought, like, a billion of them.
You didn't get one.
-Tonight's the big night.
favorite restaurant.
I'm gonna get her favorite champagne.
She'll know how expensive it is.
When the glasses are full, instead of
proposing a toast, I'm gonna propose.
It sounds perfect!
-You'll mess it up. Let me do it.
-She won't say no.
If.
-Sure.
-What about me? I want it too.
-She won't say no.
-I'll let you borrow it.
Hey, Monica.
-Give it.
hosting a charity event for kids.
The more people I bring,
the better I look. Monica? Chandler?
We can't go.
We're going to dinner. Remember?
-Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
remember where we're going.
Where are you going?
-How about you guys?
-Open bar?
-I think so.
-I can do that for the kids.
I'll come. I'm making money.
the money you owe me.
Okay. Have a benefit.
Ross, can you go
to a charity event tonight?
I have plans with Elizabeth.
You're already doing
your part for the kids.
It's our last night before she
where is this relationship going?
All jokes aside?
I didn't agree to that.
-Do you see this as long-term?
-I don't know.
-You are  years older than her.
-Sorry.
I thought you were just making jokes.
I had no idea.
You guys are wrong. Yes, there is
a chronological age difference.
But I never notice it,
I'm dating Elizabeth, not you.
Not what she said last night.
See, now, he could date her.
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
Hey, you marry me.
-What's going on, little elves?
-It's the big night. We wish you luck.
-You have the ring?
-In my pocket.
-Phoebe.
This is a surprise.
Yeah, you guys. Get out of here.
Hey, guys.
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.
What's going on?
We're just really...
excited about this charity event
we have to go to.
-Here.
-Well, this is a silent auction.
They lay the stuff here.
You write down your offer.
Then the highest bid gets it.
I know what a silent auction is.
What's going on with your hair?
-Why?
So glad you brought someone.
Someone? I brought people.
Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson.
He's the head of my department.
-And I also brought my friend Joey.
-Shrimp toast!
You know, I don't know where he is.
I hope you'll bid.
Actually, I was about to bid
-Thank you.
Okay.
Twenty dollars.
Shut the door! Shut the door!
-What's going on?
-Guys are throwing water balloons.
Call the cops. That's what I did
to kids in my building.
No, it's a water balloon fight.
to see this play tonight.
It's excellent. The director is..
-Who drank all the kamikazes?
-Nobody. We put them in here!
You want some?
-Could I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah, sure.
So this play, what do you think?
-It's gotten great reviews..
-You put your balloons down!
Everybody put their balloons down!
Now, this is a nice suit!
If you'll excuse us...
I would like to speak
to Elizabeth alone for a moment.
Whoa, Liz. Your dad's a bummer.
Our next item is
the romantic trip to Paris.
It goes to Emil Alexander
-Open bar.
Well, now it's an empty bar.
You can't stand anyone else
enjoying themselves, can you?
Finally, our biggest item.
The -foot
Gentleman's Daysailer sailboat.
The winning bid
-I guessed $,.
Joey, it is an auction.
You don't guess. You buy!
What?
I don't have $,.
Congratulations on your new boat,
Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, sit down.
Forget her. You enjoy this.
What are you doing?
"One nation...
under God, indivisible,
The champagne is here.
-You okay?
-Yes. I'm good. Are you good?
Is everything..? Are you perfect?
Yeah. I'm okay.
Actually, I'm a bit cold.
Can I have your jacket?
No, you can't have my jacket.
Because then I would be cold.
If you thought you'd be cold,
-Yes. I'm fine.
In fact, I've been fine
for a long time now and I think...
the reason is you.
That's sweet.
Before I met you,
I had really little life.
-And I couldn't imagine growing old..
-Richard.
What? I'm Chandler.
Oh, that's Richard.
Maybe he won't see us. Richard!
Monica. Chandler.
I don't know why I did that.
-Good to see you.
-You too. You let your hair grow.
That's right. You always wanted me to.
-I see your mustache is back.
-Well, my nose got lonely.
You don't have a mustache,
when I'm uncomfortable.
-Hi, I'm Lisa.
-Hi.
I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler.
We used to date.
Richard, no one's supposed
-I'll sit down.
-Good to see you.
-Your table's ready, sir.
Good to see you guys.
If you prefer, this table's available.
That might be fun.
-What were you thinking?
-I didn't know it was an auction.
I figured I'd take a guess.
you've had enough to drink?
I'm just helping the kids.
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Because the more I drink, the less
there is for the kids to drink.
Mr. Tribbiani,
your contribution brings us...
a step closer
-So am I.
I'm curious.
How much is that boat worth?
-I think it was valued at ,.
-Hey, I was pretty close.
So, bad news.
I can't buy the boat.
-You can't leave, Joey!
You agreed to buy that boat.
It's a contract.
Plus, if you leave,
my boss will kill me.
I don't have that kind of money.
I know. Okay, okay.
highest bidder buy it.
Then you'll pay the difference.
Okay. I don't know why the kids
need a youth center anyway.
They should just watch TV after school
like I did. I turned out fine.
Not great.
I'm helping the kids so much
her parents come in.
I hide in the shower.
They start going at it on the floor.
Oh, my God!
I got a good one.
I once walked in on both my parents
making love to the same guy.
It's so great seeing you guys again.
"In the sweetness of friendship...
Let there be laughter
and sharing of pleasures.
In the dew of little things, the heart
finds its morning and is refreshed."
What?
Oh, my God! You guys!
Have we got a story for you.
-Richard!
Right, that's Richard's
favorite place too.
-Oh, you knew that? Good.
-Weren't you going out with Elizabeth?
I was. She was a little busy
they can't get out of.
Maybe she is too young for me.
When I was over there,
I felt like I was a babysitter.
I see what you were talking about.
I don't know what to do.
Weigh the good stuff
first started... weighing stuff.
Okay, bad stuff.
I'm  years older than she is.
The school could fire you.
-She's leaving for three months.
-For camp.
Okay, good stuff.
Well, she's sweet and pretty and..
And the sex is probably great, huh?
It's tender and respectful,
"Do you see a future?"
Do you see yourself marrying her?
My God. You married her, didn't you?
No, I didn't do that. It's just...
Okay, honestly, no.
I don't see a big future with her.
Okay, I think that's your answer.
I gotta talk to her. I hate this part.
Forget Elizabeth.
If you're not careful...
you may not get married
-Good luck with Elizabeth, my man.
My God, Phoebe, how many have you had?
, , ... Seven times three..
!
-You must be just wasted!
-I'm a little tired.
-Next highest bidder is at table one.
is at table four.
-Why do you care about who won?
-It's a trip for two.
Excuse me.
Is the person who won
the Paris trip at this table?
-That was me.
-That's me.
Well, hello. This is your
lucky day, Mr. Bowmont.
The Gentleman Daysailer
has become available again...
and I believe you made
It's not just a guess.
I was relieved I didn't win.
My wife would've killed me.
You kidding? She'll love this boat!
-What is your wife's name?
-Pam.
Just imagine this: The Pam.
I don't think she'd like that.
Okay. Imagine this:
-Let me paint you a little picture.
You are setting sail up the Hudson.
You've got the wind in your... arms.
You get all that peace and quiet
you've always wanted.
You get back to nature.
People call you captain.
And then when you're old, Cappy.
-It's for a good cause. All right.
-No way! It's mine!
What?
-The stuff you said, I want that!
-But you don't have $,!
Who cares? I'll make payments!
-Let me see it. Let me see your hand.
Why do you wanna see my hand?
I wanna see what's in your hand.
I wanna see the trash.
It's all dirty.
You should throw this out.
-What did you just do?
-Oh, no.
I was gonna surprise her tomorrow.
-Now you've ruined it.
-We didn't.
Who walks in a room
and asks to see a person's hands?
A palm reader, a manicurist,
-Good one!
This is terrible. What will I do?
She only suspects something.
So just throw her off the track.
I'll pretend marriage
is the last thing on my mind.
Convince her you're scared
I've had years of practice.
Being you is finally gonna pay off!
Some idiot keeps stuffing
the trash chute with pizza boxes.
That guy is still doing that?
Oh, my God. Let me see your hand!
You're too late!
She already took out the trash!
Look, Elizabeth, we have to talk.
I have never had
I was just thinking about..
You suck!
What?
Breakup's still on.
Here she comes. Do I look like
I don't wanna get married?
And, also, a little like a French guy.
I never noticed that before.
-What are you up to?
-Hanging out. Talking about websites.
We saw this interesting website
for the government to keep tabs.
Yeah, Big Brother.
That's a bit crazy.
Although I am glad you're looking
at other things on the lnternet.
Got me thinking.
Why would anybody want to get married?
To celebrate the relationship,
to the world.
Well, that's good to know.
The Mr. Bowmont is here!
A diner wants to compliment you.
Shall I let him in?
Sure. I love this part.
-Come on in.
-Hi.
-Richard.
to compliment the chef.
Like I have nothing better to do.
So, what's up?
It was great seeing you
the other night.
Good to see you too.
-You came to tell me that?
-I came to tell you something else.
I came here to tell you
be here telling you this.
You're with Chandler, who I like.
If you say he's straight,
I'll believe you.
After seeing you, I knew if I didn't
tell you I'd regret it.
Letting you go was
supposed to be back here.
I'm sorry. I know this is
the wrong time and the wrong place...
but I had to tell you.
I wanna spend my life with you.
I wanna marry you.
I wanna have kids with you.
Oh, my God.
but am I too late?
You're too late.
Where was all this three years ago?
I know. I was an idiot.
I tried to forget you. I really did.
After our last lunch, I spent
six months in Africa trying to forget.
-What did you do there?
but this is not gonna happen.
That's fine. I'll walk away.
I'll never bother you again.
Only if you say Chandler's willing
to give you everything I am.
Well, he is. I mean...
marriage is all he talks about.
are getting married.
I know. They'll be so happy together.
How often do two best friends
fall in love?
-Not that often.
-No.
-I'm so happy for them.
and maybe % jealous.
-I mean, what's %? That's nothing.
-Totally.
-I'm like /.
-Yeah. Me too.
Have you guys seen Chandler?
No. But you know
yesterday? You don't believe that.
Sure, I do. In fact, I think the
concept of marriage is unnatural.
Look at pigs. Let's take
a second here and look at pigs.
Pigs don't mate for life.
A pig can have  sexual partners
not even a pig that's good at sports.
Yeah, but that's pigs, not people.
If marriage worked, I'd be for it.
Do you know the divorce rate?
Ninety-seven percent!
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me
you may never want to get married?
-Who's to say?
even doing? What is this?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What is all this pressure?
Is this some new strategy?
Why don't you put down your copy
of The Rules, huh, mantrap?
You know what? I gotta go.
It's okay. I got a plan.
-We're gonna find love.
% happy for Monica and Chandler.
-A guarantee would be nice.
-What do you mean?
Some friends make a deal.
Like if neither of them are married
by , they marry each other.
-A backup?
-Joey.
-Joey? Are you serious?
-I locked him in years ago.
Wait. So if neither of you are
married by , you'll marry Joey?
Yep. We shook on it.
But believe me, that is not
-Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
-It's for my boat. Pretty cool, huh?
-Yeah, it's great.
What's wrong? Talk to the captain.
Just realizing
I'm in a dead-end relationship.
-Chandler being difficult?
somewhere, that I'm not wasting time.
-You know Chandler.
-No, I don't know Chandler.
Not anymore.
It's like something's changed.
-Maybe you changed.
-Chandler is a complex fellow.
One who is unlikely to take a wife.
Is that some kind of boat talk?
I haven't totally decided
how to talk on my boat yet.
Does he think
I'll wait around for nothing?
Face it.
who do wanna marry me.
-There are?
-Yeah. Richard.
Richard said he wants to marry you?
-And Chandler says he hates marriage?
-That's right.
Chandler loves marriage!
You just said he hates marriage!
"He's a complex fellow
and always will be"!
You got that from what I said?
After the Cretaceous Period,
the dinosaurs were gone.
What happened, you guys?
-Rach.
-Hey, you.
-Come on in.
to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Thanks. I really thought
we'd be able to make it work.
I guess it wasn't meant to be.
Yeah. Love.
It's a tricky business, isn't it?
-I guess so.
we get married.
I mean, we know each other,
we like each other...
we've already slept together,
so there'll be no surprises.
No, like, "What's that?"
-Oh, you want me to be your backup.
-Phoebe.
Phoebe?
But she just said Joey is her backup.
Oh, I don't think so.
We just spoke. She said
that she and Joey made a deal.
That's impossible. We have had
a deal for years. We shook on it.
Although, believe me,
do they serve at sea?
Where the hell have you been?!
I was making a coconut phone
with the Professor.
Richard told Monica
he wants to marry her.
-What?
boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
-Oh, my God!
-I know! They suck!
He's not supposed to ask her
to marry him! I am!
-I know!
I'll go over there and kick his ass!
Will you help me?
Look, I don't think us getting
our asses kicked is a solution, okay?
-Look, just go and find Monica.
-You're right.
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring...
I'm gonna go find her
might be good for the boat.
Hi.
Hi.
I don't know why I'm here.
I didn't ask.
-You wanna come in?
-I don't know.
Oh, okay.
I'll just leave the door open
and sit on the couch.
-Chandler is such an idiot!
-Rocks with a twist?
I remember.
You still smoking cigars?
No, no. That's art.
If it bothers you,
I can put my art out.
No, that's okay.
So, Monica, let me ask you a question.
Since we broke up, do you ever...
think about me?
Actually, I thought about you
a few months ago.
-Really?
and I don't like my new eye doctor.
-Who is it?
-Edward Nevsky.
He's no good.
Do you ever think about me...
-in a non-eye-doctor way?
-No.
Because getting over you was
-Of course I can.
It's good sense
to back up your backup.
-Look, I've already lost Chandler.
-What?
Hey, Phoebe! We're both your backup?
How could you do this to me?
Why are you complaining?
-No, we weren't!
This kind of backtalk won't fly
when we're married.
You can't have both. Pick one.
-Pick me!
-No, pick me!
-I don't wanna end up an old maid.
I wanna switch to Rachel.
-I wanna switch to Rachel too.
-No, wait. Just wait.
Wait, guys.
Don't make any rash decisions.
Just remember my promise:
If we get married, three times a week.
Oh, my God. Phoebe...
I'm talking about massages.
No, I'm not.
I know how to settle it.
on one napkin...
and "Ross" on the other napkin
and we're gonna pick one.
That person will be our backup. Okay?
-Sounds fair.
-All right.
Good. Switching them up.
-Pick one.
-You're welcome.
-Ross.
-Joey.
-We should switch.
-Absolutely.
I missed you,
Now, this is a grownup's apartment.
I should be with a grownup, you know?
You're saying you need to be
with someone more mature.
Maybe someone with...
a license to practice medicine.
Or a mustache.
Let's face it. I'm not a kid anymore.
I need someone
who wants the same things.
Coming to my work and telling me
I don't want that!
I think that's fair.
Please, don't even talk
to me about fair.
Fair would've been you
wanting to marry me then.
Or Chandler wanting to marry me now.
Believe me, nothing
-It's okay.
Nothing.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I know.
I have to figure some..
Some stuff, before I can...
I understand.
Take as much time as you want.
Ten, even  minutes, if you need it.
I'll be here. Not smoking.
Where is she?
I'm not scared of you.
She's not here. And please come in.
Scotch on the rocks...
with a twist, on a coaster.
Monica?
Okay, she was here. But she left.
Where did she go?
She said she had to think things over.
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.
I thought you were a good guy.
Look, nothing happened.
Nothing? So you didn't tell
my girlfriend you love her?
Well, all right, one thing happened.
You know what you did?
-Well...
I'm willing to offer her
things that you aren't.
I'm willing to offer her
those things. I had a plan...
to throw her off so when I offered
you big tree.
This isn't fair.
You had your chance with her,
and you blew it!
This is my chance. I won't blow it,
because we are meant for each other.
And this has all just been
-Yeah, I even...
got a ring. Did you get a ring?
No, I don't have a ring.
You go get her, Chandler.
And can I give you a piece of advice?
If you do get her...
don't let her go.
Trust me.
You know, Richard, you are a good guy.
I know.
I hate that.
-I've gotta find Monica.
-She's gone.
-What?
-She had a bag and she left.
-What?
want different things.
-Why didn't you tell her it was a plan?
-I told her everything.
-But she wouldn't believe me.
-Well, where..? Where did she go?
To her parents'. She said you shouldn't
-I am so sorry, man.
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Oh, my God.
Chandler...
in all my life...
I never thought
I would be so lucky...
as to fall in love with my best...
My best...
There's a reason why
girls don't do this!
I'll do it. I thought...
Wait, I can do this.
I thought that it mattered...
what I said or where I said it.
Then I realized...
the only thing that matters
than I ever thought I could be.
And if you let me...
I'll spend all my life trying
to make you feel the same way.
Monica...
will you marry me?
Yes.
I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Can we come in yet?
We're dying out here!
Come in! Come in!
We're engaged!
This is the least jealous
Ross isn't here!
Hell, he's done it three times.
He knows what it's about!
