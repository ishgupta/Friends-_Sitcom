wrong with him.
So does he have a hump
and a hairpiece?
Wait, does he eat chalk?
I don't want her to go through
what I did with Carl.
Okay, everybody relax.
This is not even a date.
It's just two people going out
in the cafeteria..
and I realize I'm totally naked.
I've had that dream.
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone...
there.
- Instead of
- That's right!
Never had that one.
All of a sudden,
because she never calls me.
He says, "Hello,"
I want to kill myself.
You okay?
I feel like someone pulled my
intestine out of my mouth...
and tied it around my neck.
- Thanks.
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.
- Just leave my aura alone, okay?
- Fine, be murky.
- I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy.
No, you don't.
To hell with her. She left me!
And you never knew she was a lesbian.
Why does everyone
How should I know?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
Did I say that out loud?
Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.
You're angry. You're hurting.
Can I tell you what
the answer is?
Strip joints!
See, but I don't want
Hi! Thank God!
I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said...
...that you might be here and you are.
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.
Everybody, this is Rachel,
Chandler and Phoebe..
...and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?
Sure!
You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Oh, God! Well, it started about
all the presents...
This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.
When all of a sudden I realize...
Sweet 'N Low?
I realized...
...I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.
And then I really freaked out,
Mr. Potato Head.
I always knew he looked
familiar, but. . . .
I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering. . .
. . . ''Why am I doing this?''
you and I have drifted apart. . .
. . .but you're the only person
I know in the city.
Who wasn't asked to the wedding.
I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.
I guess he bought her
happy about it.
Daddy, I just--
I can't marry him.
I'm sorry.
I just don't love him.
Well, it matters to me!
She should not be
wearing those pants.
I say push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!
always told me, ''You're a shoe! ''
''You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe! ''
I stopped and said,
''What if I don't wanna be a shoe?
What if I want to be a purse?
Or a hat?''
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
here with Monica.
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.
Well, maybe that's my decision.
Well, maybe I don't need your money.
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!
Just breathe.
Breathe, that's it.
Just try to think
And whiskers on kittens
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens
La la la something
And noodles with string
-These are a--
the best, you know?
Independence.
Taking control of your life.
If you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
It's her wedding day.
What? Like there's
a rule or something?
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.
It's Paul.
Buzz him in.
-Who's Paul?
is with Paul, the wine guy?
He finally asked you out?
It's a ''Dear Diary'' moment.
Rach, I can cancel.
Oh, God. Please, no.
Go, I'll be fine.
Ross are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?
That'd be good.
-Really?
Everybody, this is Paul.
-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. Paul?
Change. Sit down.
Two seconds.
I just pulled out four eyelashes.

I was supposed to be headed

Although, Aruba. This time of year?

I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever. . .
. . .and I cannot feel my legs.
-Which goes where?
-All finished.
This was Carol's favorite beer.
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.
Let me ask you a question.
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.
What did you get?
You guys.
-You got screwed.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.
I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.
I mean, how clean can teeth get?
My brother's going through that.
He's a mess.
How did you get through it?
He might try accidentally breaking
-Leg?
That's one way of going through it.
Me, I went for the watch.
You actually broke her watch?
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.
You probably think it's about making
And I just--
Machine cut me off again.
Anyway. . . .
You know what's scary? What if there
is only one woman for everybody?
I mean, what if you get one
there was only one woman for her.
What are you talking about?
One woman.
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.
Let me tell you something.

You can get them with jimmies,
or nuts, or whipped cream.
This is the best thing that
ever happened to you!
You got married. You were
Grab a spoon!
I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.
Then stay out of my freezer.
Ever since she
walked out on me, I. . . .
What? What?
You wanna spell it out with noodles?
It's more of a fifth date
not what you need right now.
How long?
Two years.
I'm glad you smashed her watch.
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?
Yeah, I do.
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.
''Grab a spoon. ''
Do you know long it's been

You know, here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough. . .
. . .to ask a woman out. . .
. . .who am I going to ask?
Isn't this amazing?
I have never made coffee
before in my life.
-That is amazing.

Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-Morning.
-Hi. Paul, is it?
Last night was like. . .
-Thank you so much.
We'll talk later.
Thank you.
That wasn't a real date.
What the hell do you do
on a real date?
Shut up and put my table back.
I've got to get to work.
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Yeah, we all have jobs.
That's how we buy stuff.
Yeah, I'm an actor.
Have I seen you in anything?
I doubt it.
Wee One's production of Pinocchio...
''Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy. ''
I will not take this abuse.
You're right. I'm sorry..
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

You sleep okay?
Did you talk to Barry?

I know. He's just so--
Remember you and Tony De Marco?
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.
-Are you in trouble!
I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.
Or else I'm just going
-What for?
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.
-Hey, Monica.
-Hey, Franny. Welcome back.
How was Florida?
You had sex, didn't you?
How do you do that?
So, who?
You know Paul?
Paul, the wine guy?
Yeah, I know Paul.
You mean, you know Paul
I take credit for Paul.
Before me, there was no snap in his

Of course it was a line.

I knew.
You did?
I figured you thought I was

Do you think it would be okay if

It's just some guy I work with.
You're going out with a guy.
There's gotta be something
wrong with him.
All right, Joey, be nice.
So does he have a hump
through what I did with Carl.
Okay, everybody relax.
Relax. This is not even a date.
It's just two people going out to
dinner and not having sex.
Sounds like a date to me.
I'm in high school,
in the middle of the cafeteria. . .

I've had that dream.
Then I look down and I realize

That one, I've never had.
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.
I don't know what to do.
Everybody's looking at me.
They weren't looking at you before?
Finally, I figure
because she never calls me.
This guy says, ''Hello,''
I wanna kill myself.
You okay, sweetie?
I feel like someone grabbed my small
intestine, pulled it out of my mouth. . .

-Thanks.
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.
Just leave my aura alone, okay?
Fine. Be murky.

Why does everyone
How should I know?
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
Did I say that out loud?
I told Mom and Dad last night.
They seemed to take it well.
Really? So that hysterical call I got
from a woman sobbing at  a.m. . .

Was, what? A wrong number?
Sorry.
Look, you're feeling
the answer is?
Strip joints!

I didn't know where to go, and I know
you and I have drifted apart. . .

Who wasn't asked to the wedding.
I was kind of hoping that

I stopped and said,
''What if I don't wanna be a shoe?
What if I want to be a purse?
Or a hat?''
I don't want you to buy me a hat,

It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Look, Daddy, it's my life.
Well, maybe I'll just stay
she's staying with Monica.
Well, maybe that's my decision.
Well, maybe I don't need your money.
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

"Why am I doing this,"
and "Who am I doing it for?"
I didn't know where to go,
and I know we've drifted apart..
but you're the only person
- I hoped that wouldn't be an issue.
I guess he bought her the pipe organ,
and she's really not happy about it.
"Tuna or egg salad!
Decide!"
"I'll have whatever
I can't marry him.
I'm sorry.
I just don't love him.
Well, it matters to me!
"If I let go of my hair,
my head will fall off."
She should not be
Push her down the stairs!
Come on, Daddy, listen!
All my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!"
"You're a shoe!"
What if I don't want to be a shoe?
What if I want to be a purse?
Or a hat?
No, I don't want you
to buy me a hat!
It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Look, Daddy,
here with Monica.
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.
Well, maybe that's my decision.
Maybe I don't need your money.
Wait!
I said maybe!
Just breathe. That's it.
Try to think of nice, calm things.
Raindrops on roses
And something with mittens
La la la something
And noodles with string
I'm all better now.
I helped.
This is probably for the best.
Independence. Controlling your life.
The whole hat thing.
You can always come to Joey.
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
It's her wedding day.
Like there's a rule, or something?
I got it.
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.
It's Paul.
Buzz him in.
- Who's Paul?
is with Paul, the wine guy?
- He finally asked you out?
- Yes!
It's a "Dear Diary" moment.
- Rach, I can cancel.
- Please, go, I'll be fine.
Ross, are you okay?
Paul, this is..
everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.
- The wine guy.
- I didn't catch your name. Paul?
I'll be right back.
Two seconds.
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.
Hey, Paul, here's a tip.
She really likes it when you
rub her neck in the same spot..
until it starts to get red.
Shut up, Joey!
What are you up to tonight?
I was supposed to be headed
getting your honeymoon.
Although, Aruba.
This time of year?
Talk about your..
big lizards.
If you don't want
to be alone tonight..
Joey and Chandler are
going to hang out here.
- It's been a long day.
- Oh, sure.
Phoebe, wanna help?
I wish I could,
but I don't want to.
Love is sweet as summer showers
Oh, your love, your love
Is like a giant pigeon
Crapping on my heart
Thank you.
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things..
using a bunch of these
little worm guys.
I have no bracket-y thing.
- It's beautiful.
What's this?
I would have to say
that is an L-shaped bracket.
- Which goes where?
- I have no idea.
- Done with the bookcase.
I should have known.
- Start with that, we're out of here.
- Please don't spoil all this fun.
Let me ask you.
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.
What did you get?
- You guys.
- I know. I'm such an idiot.
I should've known when she went to
the dentist five times a week.
I mean, how clean can teeth get?
My brother's going through that.
How did you get over it?
He might accidentally
break something valuable of hers.
- Say her
I went for the watch.
You actually broke her watch?
The worst I ever did was shred
my old boyfriend's favorite towel.
- Steer clear of you.
- That's right.
Barry, I'm sorry.
love with your socks on, but it isn't.
It's about me.
And I just
The machine cut me off again.
Anyway..
I know that some lucky girl is going
It's not me.
Not that I have any idea who "me" is
right now, but you just
I'm divorced.
- I'm only , and I'm divorced!
- Shut up!
That only took me an hour.
We haven't had a relationship
for four years.
Four years of closeness and sharing,
after which she ripped your heart out.
That is why we don't do it!
I don't think that was my point!
Know what's scary? What if there's
only one woman for everybody?
I mean, what if you get one
there was only one woman for her.
What are you talking about?
One woman.
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream.
Let me tell you something.
and bing cherry vanilla.
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.
It's the best thing
to happen to you!
You got married.
Grab a spoon!
- I don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
- Then stay out of my freezer.
Ever since she walked out on me..
What?
You wanna spell it out with noodles?
It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.
So there's going to be
I think there is.
What were you going to say?
Ever since she left me..
I haven't been able to perform..
sexually.
Oh, God!
I'm so sorry.
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.
How long?
- Two years.
want that fifth date?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
We are gathered here
to join Joanie Louise Cunningham..
and Charles.
That's the difference.
"Grab a spoon."
Do you know how long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?
Do the words, "Billy, don't be
a hero," mean anything to you?
Great story.
Angela. No, Andrea.
Andrea's the screamer.
Angela has cats.
Right, thanks. It's Julie.
I'm out of here.
Here's the thing. Even if
I've never made coffee in my life.
- That is amazing.
- Congratulations.
If I can make coffee,
there isn't anything I can't do.
I think it's, "If I can invade Poland,
a Western omelet or something..
Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.
Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.
- Good morning.
- Morning, Paul.
- Hello, Paul.
- Hi. Paul, is it?
- Thank you so much.
- Stop.
Last night was like
in Witness.
We'll talk later.
Thank you.
That wasn't a real date.
What the hell do you do
on a real date?
Shut up and put my table back.
I've got to get to work.
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?
Yeah, we all have jobs.
- Have I seen you in anything?
I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.
Unless you saw the Wee One's
production of Pinocchio..
at the little theater
I'm a real live boy."
- I will not take this abuse.
- You're right, I'm sorry.
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy
You should both know
Sleep okay?
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.
I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.
I know.
- Oh, yeah.
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.
- Wow, are you in trouble!
- Big time!
Want a wedding dress?
ahead of ourselves.
I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.
Or else I'm going to get up
and go to work.
- Wish me luck!
of those job things.
- Hi, Monica.
- Franny, welcome back.
- How was Florida?
- You had sex, didn't you?
- How do you do that?
Parrot Jungle, you're having sex.
So, who?
You know Paul?
Paul, the wine guy?
Yeah, I know Paul.
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?
What?
turtle for two years.
Of course it was a line.
Why would anybody
do something like that?
I assume we want an answer
more sophisticated than
"To get you into bed."
I hate men.
Don't hate. You don't want
beacon that only dogs..
and men with emotional problems
can hear?
Come here.
Give me your feet.
I just thought he was nice, you know?
I can't believe
- You got a job?
Are you kidding?
I'm trained for nothing.
- I was laughed out of  interviews.
- You're surprisingly upbeat.
You'd be too,
"I don't need a job..
I've got great boots" boots.
- How did you pay?
- Credit card.
And who pays for that?
My father.
Is this really necessary?
I can stop charging any time.
You can't live off your parents.
I know that.
It's hard being on your own.
Thank you.
I remember when I first
came to this city, I was .
Mom had killed herself,
stepdad was in jail.
I didn't know anybody here.
I ended up living with this albino
So I know exactly how you feel.
The word you're looking for is
"Anyway.."
- You ready?
- No, how can I be ready?
"Ready to jump out of the plane
with no parachute?"
- I can't do this.
- You made coffee, you can do anything.
Cut. Cut. Cut.
You know what?
I think we can leave it at that.
- Kind of a symbolic gesture.
- Rachel, that was a library card.
If you listen closely, you can hear
You're gonna love it.
That's it.
Are you going to crash on the couch?
- No, I gotta go home sometime.
- Are you gonna be okay?
Look what I just
Just put it back where you found it.
Oh, boy!
All right.
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.
- I'm sorry. Have it, I don't want it.
but in high school..
I had a major crush on you.
I knew.
You did?
I figured you thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.
I did.
Listen, do you think..?
Try not to let my vulnerability
become a factor here.
Do you think it would be okay
- Good night.
See you.
Wait, wait.
What's with you?
I just grabbed a spoon.
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- Can't believe what I'm hearing
- What? I said
- Was I doing it again?
Yes!
I said you had a nice butt.
It's just not a great butt.
- You won't know a butt if it bit you.
- There's an image.
Would anybody like more coffee?
You made it,
- I'll have a cup of coffee.
Kids, new dream.
I'm in Las Vegas.
Miss, more coffee?
Could you give this
to that guy over there?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Sorry.
What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it.
Yeah, right!
You serious?
Oh, yeah!
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Absolutely.
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much
like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's
we don't like the comedian,
it's that-that... that's not
why we bought the ticket.
The problem is, though, after the concert's
over, no matter how great the show was,
you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know?
I mean, we're in the car,
we're fighting traffic... basically
just trying to stay awake.
Yeah, well, word of advice: 
gonna find yourself
sitting at home, listening
to that album alone.
Are we still talking about sex?
FRIENDS
 The one whith
the sonogram at the end
No, it's good, it is good, 
head with a club, while she sits at home
trying to get the mastodon 
smell out of the carpet!
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay?
They have issues like...
'Gee, that glacier's
getting kinda close.' See?
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
with you in the Ice Age.
Hi.
So.
You look great. I, uh...
I hate that.
Sorry. Thanks.
You look good too.
Ah, well, in here, 
anyone who...
stands erect...
So what's new? Still, uh...
A lesbian?
Well... you never know.
How's, um... how's the family?
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh...
Why... why are you here, Carol?
I'm pregnant.
Pregnant?!
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company
where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
Then I've already seen this one!
Are you through with that?
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing 
note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it,
so I balled it up and... 
...now I wish I was dead.
She's already fluffed that pillow...
Monica, you know, you've 
already fluffed that...
them any more ammunition than they already have.
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent
can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Monica... Hi! 
Um, Monica, you're scaring me.
I mean, you're like, you're like all
chaotic and twirly.
And not-not in a good way.
Yeah, calm down.
You don't see Ross getting all
concerned, Ross can do no wrong.
Y'see, he's the Prince.
Apparently they had some
big ceremony before I was born.
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
What?
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Eeaagh!
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
enough, having to give it back to him...
'Hi Barry! Remember me? 
I'm the girl in the veil
who stomped on your heart 
in front of your entire family!'
Oh God and now I'm gonna have to 
Won't we!
Oh! Yeah!
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Doy! 
Probably right before she lost it!
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
I know I had it this morning,
and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
...Dinah?
Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
You didn't.
Oh, I am sorry...
I gave you one job!
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you
wha... w... w... w...
Yeah. Do that for another two hours,
you might be where I am right about now.
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in
perspective, huh, Mon?
Well now, how...
how do you fit into this whole thing?
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me
your job is done.
Anyway, they want me to go down to this...
sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
So what are you gonna do?
I have no idea.
No matter what I do, though,
I'm still gonna be a father.
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
Oh, Martha Ludwin's
daughter is gonna call you.
Mmm! What's that curry taste?
Curry.
The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
They all had a thing for him.
Aw, Mom...
I'm sorry, why is this 
girl going to call me?
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants
 to be something in cooking, or food, or...
I don't know.
Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant...
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant,
with the spaghetti, please?
Yeah.
Oh, we're having spaghetti!
That's.... easy.
I know this is going to sound 
unbelievably selfish,
but, were you planning on bringing
some of the heat off me.
What that Rachel did to her life...
We ran into her parents at the club,
they were not playing very well.
I'm not gonna tell you what
they spent on that wedding...
but forty thousand dollars
chance to leave a man at the altar...
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing!
It's an expression.
No it's not.
Don't listen to your mother.
You're independent, and you always have been!
Even when you were a kid...
and you were chubby, and you had 
and your puzzles...
Look, there are people like Ross
who need to shoot for the stars,
with his museum,
and his papers getting published.
Other people are satisfied with
these are the people who never get cancer.
And I read about these women 
trying to have it all,
and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica'
doesn't seem to have that problem.
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?
No news, no little anecdotes 
Look, I, uh... I realise you guys
have been wondering what exactly
happened between Carol and me, and,
so, well, here's the deal.
Carol's a lesbian.
She's living with a woman named Susan.
She's pregnant with my child, and she and
Susan are going to raise the baby.
And you knew about this?!
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Well, y'know, these people are pros.
They know what they're doing,
they take their time,
they get the job done.
Boy, I know they say
I'd want yours.
Must pee.
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
You're twins?
Yeah. We don't speak.
She's like this high-powered, 
driven career type.
What does she do?
I kinda gotta clean up now.
Chandler, you're an only child, right?
You don't have any of this.
Well, no, although I did have an 
imaginary friend, who...
my parents actually preferred.
The lights, please...
How long was I in there?
I'm just cleaning up.
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Uh.. okay, sure!
you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
Oh.. a little.. 
Mm-hmm.. A lot.
Mm.
So, got any advice?
Y'know, as someone who's 
this broken shell of a man, y'know,
so you should try not to look too terrific,
I know it'll be hard.
Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll 
give Barry back his ring,
and you can go with 
in high school together?
Yeah.
I mean, didn't you think you were just
gonna meet somone, fall in love...
and that'd be it?
...Ross?
I was stuck at work.
There was this big dinosaur... thing...
anyway.
Hi.
Ross, you remember Susan.
How could I forget?
Ross.
 Good shake. Good shake.
So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
Dr. Oberman.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he...
She.
...she, of course
She... uh... familiar with our...
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
So, how ya doin?
I'm... uh...
I'm okay...
You look great!
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
Be right there.
Be back in a sec.
I dumped him.
Okay.
So, um... so how's this, uh,
decisions have to be made?
Give me a 'for instance'.
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, 
okay, okay,
How about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
-Marlon!
Minnie if it's a girl.
...As in Mouse?
As in my grandmother.
Still, you... you say Minnie, 
you hear Mouse.
Um, how about, um...
how about Julia?
Julia.
We agreed on Minnie.
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend
the rest of our lives together.
Things change, 
You went on our honeymoon alone?
No.
I went with, uh..
Now, this may hurt.
Me?!
No!
I went with Mindy.
Mindy?
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
Oh! Well, um..
your finger in your eye!
Not for her.
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Okay...
See, about a month ago,
I wanted to hurt you.
More than I've ever wanted to 
What's wrong with Helen?
Helen Geller?
I don't think so.
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
Thank you!
No, I mean it's not Geller.
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
No, actually, um,
we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
Well, wait a minute, wha...
why is she in the title?
It's my baby too.
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember
what a challenge that is!
All right, you two, stop it!
No no no, she gets a credit, hey,
I'm in there too.
Ross. You're not actually suggesting
Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller?
'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
Of course not, I'm... 
He knows no-one's gonna say all
those names, so they'll wind up calling her
Geller, then he gets his way!
My way?! 
this moment in my life being, this is not my way...
y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard.
I'm not, I can't do...
How are we today?
Any nausea?
Yeah. 
A little.
Well, I was just wondering about the 
mother-to-be, but... thanks for sharing.
Uh, lie back..
You... uh... y'know what, 
I'm gonna go.
I don't... I don't think I can be involved in this
about to attack the Enterprise.
You know, if you tilt your head to the left,
and relax your eyes,
it kinda looks like an old potato.
Then don't do that, alright?
Okay!
Monica. Whaddya think?
Am not!
You're gonna be an aunt.
Oh shut up!
Hi, Mindy.
Hi, it... it's Rachel.
Yeah, I'm fine. I... 
I saw Barry today.
Oh, yeah, yeah he... he told me.
I really do.
Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if...if
everything works out, and you guys end
up getting married and having kids...
and everything... 
I just hope they have his old
but I feel so much better now.
<font color="#ffff" size=>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
important as any part of it.
Yeah, right!
You serious?
Oh, yeah!
All you need to know
is in the first kiss.
Absolutely.
For us, kissing's an opening act. . .
. . .like the comedian
you have to sit through. . .
. . .before Pink Floyd comes out.
And it's not that
no matter how great the show was. . .
. . .you girls are always looking
for the comedian again.
We're in the car, fighting traffic. . .
. . .just trying to stay awake.
Bring back the comedian.
Or next time you'll find yourself
GELULA & CO., INC.
No, it's good.
It is good.
It's just that doesn't she seem
a little angry?
Well, she has issues.
Does she?
He's out banging other women
the mastodon smell out of the carpet.
Marsha, see, these are cave people.
Okay, they have issues like
''Gee, that glacier's
getting kind of close! '' See?
Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?
Yes, it is. Carol, hi!
Okay. Yes, it is.
I'll catch up with you
in here, anyone who. . .
. . .stands erect. . . .
So what's new?
Still a--
A lesbian?
You never know.
How's the family?
Marty's still totally paranoid.
Carol, why are you here?
I'm pregnant.
Pregnant!
She didn 't leave
in such a hurry after all.
This is the Three's Company episode
slowed me down.
Whose ball of paper is this?
That's mine. I wrote a note to
myself, then I didn't need it.
So I balled it up
and now I wish I was dead.
She already fluffed that pillow.
any more ammunition than they have.
We know how cruel parents can be. . .
. . .about the flatness
of a child's pillow.
Monica? Hi!
Monica, you're scaring me.
I mean, you're all chaotic
and twirly, you know?
Not in a good way.
Yeah, calm down.
You don't see Ross getting chaotic
Ross can do no wrong.
You see, he's ''The Prince. ''
Apparently they had some big ceremony
before I was born.
-What?
-Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.
-Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
having to return it to him.
''Barry, remember me?
I'm the girl. . .
. . .that stomped on your heart
in front of your family''
Now I must return the ring,
Won't we?
Okay, look.
When did you have it last?
Doy! Probably
right before she lost it.
You don't get
a lot of ''doy'' these days.
I know I had it this morning.
I know I had it when I was
-Oh, I'm sorry.
I gave you one job!
But look how straight
those noodles are.
That's not how you look
for an engagement ring in a lasagna.
I just can't do it.
Boys?
We're going in!
Hi.
That is not a happy ''hi. ''
Carol's pregnant.
I found it!
Yeah.
Do that for two hours. . .
. . .you might be where I am
pillow thing in perspective.
How do you fit
into this whole thing?
Carol says she and Susan
want me to be involved.
But if I'm not comfortable with it,
I miss her.
What does she mean by ''involved''?
Presumably, the biggest
part of your job is done.
Anyway, they want me
to go down to this. . .
. . .sonogram thing
I'm still gonna be a father.
This is still ruined, right?
Martha Lugwin's daughter
is going to call you.
What's that curry taste?
Curry.
I think they're great.
I really do.
Remember the Lugwins?
to be something in cooking, food. . .
. . .or I don't know.
I told her you had a restaurant.
I don't have a restaurant.
I work in a restaurant.
They don't have to know that.
Ross, help me with the spaghetti.
Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's. . .
. . .easy.
This'll sound unbelievably selfish
up the baby/lesbian thing?
It'd take the heat off of me.
What Rachel did to her life!
We ran into her parents at the club.
They were not playing very well.
I won't say what they
spent on that wedding. . .
. . .but $, is a lot of money.
At least she had the chance
-No, it's not.
Don't listen to her!
You've always been independent.
Even when you were a kid,
and you were chubby. . .
. . .and you had no friends,
And your puzzles. . . .
There are people, like Ross,
who need to shoot for the stars.
With his museum and
his papers getting published.
Others are satisfied as they are.
I'm telling you, these are
to have it all, and I thank God. . .
. . .our little Harmonica
doesn't have that problem.
So, Ross, what's going on with you?
Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?
Look, I realize you guys
between Carol and me.
So here's the deal.
Carol's a lesbian.
She's living with a woman named Susan.
She's pregnant with my child.
And she and Susan are
going to raise the baby.
And you knew about this?
Your folks are really that bad?
Well, you know, these people are pros.
They know what they do.
They take their time.
They get the job done!
Boy, I know they say that
-Yeah. We don't speak.
She's this high-powered,
driven, career-type.
-What does she do?
-She's a waitress.
All right. You guys,
You don't have any of this.
No, although I did have
an imaginary friend. . .
. . .who my parents preferred.
Hit the lights, please.
How long was I in there?
I'm just cleaning up.
Do you need any help?
Okay, sure. Thanks.
Anyway. . . .
So you nervous
about Barry tomorrow?
A little.
A lot.
So, got any advice?
You know, as someone
of the word ''dumped. ''
Chances are he's going to be this
broken shell of a man. You know?
You should try not to look too terrific.
I know it'll be hard.
You know, I'll go down there,
and Susan to the OB-G YN.
You've got Carol tomorrow.
When did it get so complicated?
Got me.
Remember when we were
in high school together?
Didn't you think you'd meet someone. . .
. . .fall in love, and that'd be it?
Man! I never thought I'd be here.
Me neither.
Sorry I'm late.
I got stuck at work.
There was this big
-How could I forget?
Hello, Susan.
Good shake, good shake.
So we're just waiting for. . .?
-Dr. Oberman.
-And is he--?
-She.
special situation?
Yes, and she's very supportive.
Great! Okay, that's great!
No, I'm. . . .
Thanks.
That opens my cervix.
Barry?
Come on in.
Are you sure?
It's fine, it's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
So how are you doing?
I'm. . . .
I'm okay.
You look great.
Dr. Farber, Jason
Greenspan 's gagging.
Be right there.
decisions have to be made?
Give me a ''for instance. ''
Well, I don't know.
-How about with the baby's name?
-Marlon. . .
. . .if it's a boy.
Minnie, if it's a girl.
As in ''Mouse''?
As in my grandmother.
Still, you say ''Minnie,''
our lives together.
Things change.
Roll with the punches.
I believe Julia's on the table.
Sorry about that.
So what have you been up to?
Not much.
I got a job.
That's great!
Why are you so tan?
I went to Aruba.
Oh, no!
You went on our honeymoon alone?
No.
See, I went with. . . .
-Now, this may hurt.
haven't quite taken yet.
And you got lenses.
But you hate sticking
your finger in your eye.
Not for her.
Listen, I really
wanted to thank you.
A month ago,
wanted to hurt anyone.
And I'm an orthodontist.
You know, you were right.
I thought we were happy.
We weren't.
But with Mindy. . .
. . .now I'm happy.
-Spit.
-What?
Me.
Anyway. . . .
I guess this belongs to you.
And thank you for giving it to me.
Well, thank you for giving it back.
Hello!
Oh, please!
What's wrong with Helen?
Helen Geller?
l don't think so!
It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
Thank you.
No. I mean, it's not Geller.
It'll be Helen Willick?
Actually, we talked about
Why is she in the title?
It's my baby too.
Really? I don't remember
you making any sperm.
And we all know what
a challenge that is.
You two, stop it!
She gets a credit!
I think that borders on child abuse.
Of course not!
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.
He knows no one will
say all those names.
They'll end up calling her Geller.
You think this is my way?
Of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment in my life being. . .
. . .this is not my way. You know what?
This is too hard.
Knock, knock!
-Just a little.
I was just wondering about the
mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.
Lie back.
You know what? I'm gonna go.
I don't think I can be involved
in this particular family thing.
Oh, my God!
Look at that!
I know!
Well, isn't that amazing?
What are we supposed to see?
I don't know, but I think it's about
to the left and relax your eyes. . .
. . .it kind of looks
like an old potato.
Then don't do that, all right?
What do you think?
Are you welling up?
You are.
-You are. You're welling up.
-I'm not.
-You're going to be an aunt.
I saw Barry today.
He told me. No, it's okay.
Really, it's okay.
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.
And, Min, you know,
married and having kids. . .
. . .I hope they have his old
hairline and your old nose!
I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now!
<font color="#ffff" size=>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
Hey, Pheebs!
Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Um, not so good.
He walked me to the subway and said
'We should do this again!'
Ohh. Ouch.
What?
'We should do this again' means
'You will never see me naked'.
Since when?
Since always.
It's like dating language.
Y'know, like
'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means
'I think we should see other people'
'Ha, ha, I already am'.
And everybody knows this?
Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid,
and your parents put your dog to sleep,
and they tell you it
went off to live on some farm.
That's funny, that, no, because,
The Millners' farm in Connecticut?
The Millners, they had
this unbelievable farm,
they had horses, and,
and rabbits that he could
chase and it was- it w- .....
Oh my God, Chi Chi!
FRIENDS
"So how does it feel knowing
my pain will be over.
But you'll have to live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die."
Hey, that was really good!
Thanks! Let's keep going.
Okay.
"So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"
"I just wanna go back to my cell.
 Damone smokes in his cell alone.
What?
Relax your hand!
Not so much!
Alright, now try taking a puff.
Alright..
Okay.
No. Give it to me.
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
It's fine, it's fine. Look,
Don't think of it as a cigarette..
Think of it as the thing that's
been missing from your hand.
When you're holding it, you feel right.
You feel complete.
Y'miss it?
Nah, not so much.
Alright, now we smoke.
Oh.. my.. God.
They say it's the same as the distance from
the tip of a guy's thumb
to the tip of his index finger.
That's ridiculous!
Can I use.. either thumb?
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!
Decaf cappucino for Joey..
Coffee black..
Late...
And an iced tea.
I'm getting pretty good at this!
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
Good for me!
Y'okay, Phoebe?
Yeah... no... I'm just... it's, I haven't worked...
It's my bank.
What did they do to you?
It's nothing, it's just... Okay.
STATEMENT... Easy.
...and there's five hundred
extra dollars in my account.
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
Yes, 'cause now I have to go
down there, and deal with them.
What are you talking about?
it would be like shopping!
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought
a really great pair of shoes.
Do you know what I'd hear,
with every step I took?
'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.'
And even if I was happy,
not... not... mine, not... not... mine'...
We're with you. We got it.
Okay. I'd... just... I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Chandler, what are you doing?
Hey. Whaddya doing?
Oh! Oh, God!
What is this?!
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
Oh, I can't believe you!
You've been so good, for three years!
And this... is my reward!
Hold on a second, alright?
through the last time you quit.
Okay, so this time I won't quit!
Ohhh! Put it out!
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Oh, no! I... I can't drink this now!
Alright. I'm gonna go change,
I've got a date.
This Alan again? How's it goin'?
'S'going pretty good, y'know?
It's nice, and, we're having fun.
So when do we get to meet the guy?
Let's see, today's Monday...
Never.
Oh, come on! Come on!
Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Well, then can we meet him?
Nope. Schhorry.
I mean, why should I let them meet him?
and within five minutes they're all over him.
I mean, they're like... coyotes,
picking off the weak members of the herd.
Listen. As someone who's seen
more than her fair share of bad beef,
I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.
I mean, they're your friends,
a guy home that they actually liked.
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening
are a little slimmer
if they never get to meet the guy...
Let it go, Ross.
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
Do you all promise?
Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
You can come in,
but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Hey, Pheebs.
'Dear Ms. Buffay.
Thank you for calling attention to our error.
We have credited your account
and hope you'll accept this football phone
as our free gift.'
Do you believe this?!
Now I have a thousand dollars,
and a football phone!
What bank is this?
Hey. It's him.
 Who is it?
Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.
I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin.
Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
C'mon!
...I'll go.
Let's start with the way
he kept picking at...
no, I'm sorry,
I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
Wait a minute!
We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Yeah.
Know what was great?
The way his smile was kinda crooked.
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
...What shoe?
From the nursery rhyme.
'There was a crooked man,
Who had a crooked smile,
Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against
which all future boyfriends will be measured.
What future boyfriends?
Nono, I th... I think this could be, y'know, it.
David Hasselhof impression alone.
You know I'm gonna be
doing that at parties, right?
You know what I like most about him, though?
What?
The way he makes me feel about myself.
He was unbelievable.
e was like that...that... that Bugs Bunny
cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions,
right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan,
second base-Alan, third base-...
I mean, it...it was like,
a thing or two about softball..
Can I ask you guys a question?
D'you ever think that Alan is maybe... sometimes...
What?
...I dunno, a little too Alan?
Well, no. That's impossible.
You can never be too Alan.
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness
that... that... that we adore.
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Hey, Lizzie.
Hey, Weird Girl.
I brought you alphabet soup.
thousand dollars and a football phone?
What?
Oh my God,
there's really money in here.
I know.
Weird Girl, what are you doing?
No, I want you to have it.
I don't want it.
No, no, I ha...
No, it's okay, thanks.
Please, let me do something.
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda,
and then we're even. Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
See ya.
Huh!
A thumb?!
I know! I know,
I opened it up and there it was,
just floating in there,
y'know? Like, collect all five?
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
Nooo!
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
It's worse than the thumb!
Hey, this is so unfair!
Oh, why is it unfair?
So I have a flaw! Big deal!
Like Joey's constant
knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
And Ross, with his over-pronouncing
every single word?
And Monica, with that snort
why can't you accept me for this?
Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Well, I... I could live without it.
Well, is it, like, a little annoying,
or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Oh, now, don't listen to him,
Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Oh, "you do, do you"?
You know, there's nothing
might get what they actually ordered.
The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
Did you ever go out with a
guy your friends all really like?
No.
Okay... Well, I'm going out with a guy
my friends all really like.
Wait... wait... we talking
about the guy, Monica, dump him!
I know... it's gonna be really hard.
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
No, he'll be fine.
It's the other five I'm worried about.
Do you have any respect for your body?
Don't you realise what
you're-you're doing to yourself?
Hey, y'know, I have had it with
he wants to speak to you.
Really? He does?
Hey, buddy, what's up!
Oh, she told you about that, huh.
Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now.
Well, it's not that big...
well, that's true...
Gee, y'know, no-one...
no-one's ever put it like that before.
Well, okay, thanks!
God, he's good.
If only he were a woman.
Yeah.
Ooh, Lambchop.
How old is that sock?
If I had a sock on my hand for
change somebody's nicotine patch.
Hey. Where's Joey?
Joey ate my last stick of gum,
so I killed him.
Do you think that was wrong?
I think he's across the hall.
Thanks.
There y'go.
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?...
seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
You're kidding.
Oh my God.
And on my way over here,
I stepped in gum.
...What is up with the universe?!
What's going on?
Nothing.
gets to wear their underwear...
Uh, Joey... Oh, God! Okay...
Oh! That was Lambchop!
Please, guys, we have to talk.
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...
No, I'm not.
Alright, we have to talk.
There it is!
Okay. It's-it's about Alan.
There's something that you should know.
I mean, there's really
no easy way to say this...
uh... I've decided to break up with Alan.
Is there somebody else?
No, nononono... it's just... things change.
People change.
We didn't change..
So that's it? It's over?
Just like that?
You know.. you let your guard down,
and I just... I...
Look, I... I could go on pretending...
Okay!
...but that wouldn't be fair to me,
it wouldn't be fair to Alan...
Y'know, the way they were.
I'm sorry...
Oh, she's sorry!
I feel better!
I just can't believe this!
I mean, with the holidays coming up...
I wanted him to meet my family...
I'll meet somone else.
I'm, I'm really sorry.
Yeah, I'm sorry too.
But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.
Relieved?
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you...
I just can't stand your friends.
Remember when we went to Central Park
and rented boats?
That was fun.
Yeah.
He could row like a viking.
Hi.
No no no!
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over!
I'm weak! I've gotta smoke!
I've gotta have the smoke!
If you never smoke again
I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Yeah, alright.
-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Phoebe.
How did it go?
Not so good.
He walked me home and said,
That's good, right?
Loosely translated,
''You will never see me naked. ''
Since when?
Since always.
It's, like, ''dating'' language.
Like, ''It's not you,''
dating leather-clad alcoholics. . .
. . .and complaining
about them to you. ''
''I think we should see
other people,'' means:
''Ha, ha, I already am! ''
Everybody knows this?
Cushions the blow.
Like your parents
live on a farm.
That's funny. Because our
parents actually did. . .
. . .send our dog off to live on a farm.
Ross. . .?
Hello! The Milner's farm
in Connecticut?
The Milners had this
rabbits to chase.
And it was. . . .

you're about to die?''
Warden, in five minutes

That was really good!
Thanks. Let's keep going.
''So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?''
I just wanna go back to my cell,
because in my cell I can smoke.
''Smoke away! ''
I think this is probably why Dimon
-Relax your hand.
Let your wrist go.
Not so much.
All right. Now try taking a puff.
Right.
Give it to me.
I'm not giving you a cigarette.
It's fine. Do you want to

All right. Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.

Excellent!

I'm going through my mail, and I
open up their monthly ''statement. ''
Easy!
And there's $ extra in my account.
Satan's minions at work again!
Now I have to go down there
and deal with them--
What are you talking about?
like stealing.
Yeah, but if you spent it,
it would be like shopping.
Say I bought
a great pair of shoes.
Know what I'd hear
and skipping. . .
. . .I'd hear, ''Not-not mine.
Not-not mine. ''
We're with you. We got it.
I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be like this giant karmic debt.
Chandler, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Oh, gross!
What is this?
I'm smoking! I'm smoking!
You've been so good for three years!
And this is my reward.
Just think about what you went
I've got a date.
Is this Alan again?
How's it going?
It's going pretty good.
It's nice and we're having fun.
When do we get to meet the guy?
Let's see, today's Monday. . . .

We love Steve. Steve was sexy!
Sorry.
I don't know how I feel about him.

Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef. . .

-Really?
I'd marry him for his
at parties, right?

-What?
The way he makes me feel about myself.
How was the game?
Well. . . .
We won!
How is that possible?
-Alan.
where Bugs plays every position.
But instead of Bugs, it was  st
base, Alan. nd base, Alan. . . .
It was like he made us into a team.
We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers
a thing or two about softball.
Can I ask you guys a question?
Do you think Alan
You can never be too ''Alan. ''
It's his innate ''Alan-ness''
that we adore.
I, personally, could have

Hey, Weird Girl.
-I bought alphabet soup.
Because ''--sometimes Y. ''
And something else.
Saltines?
Would you like $

What?
Oh, my God!
-There's really money in here.
-I know.
What are you doing?
I want you to have it.
It's okay. Thanks.
Please. Let me do something.
I'll tell you what. You buy me
a soda and we're even. Okay?
Keep the change.
Thanks, Lizzy.
Want a pretzel?
-No, I'm fine. Thanks.
-See you.
A thumb?
I know. I opened it
this tiny little hitchhiker.
Maybe it's a contest?
Like ''Collect all five. ''
Does anyone wanna see?
No, thanks!
Don't do that. Come on!
It's worse than the thumb.
This is so unfair.
Why is it unfair?
So I have a flaw! Big deal!
Joey's constant knuckle-
cracking isn't annoying?
And Ross, over-pronouncing
when she laughs.
I mean, what the hell
is that thing?
I accept those flaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?
Does the knuckle-cracking
is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Don't listen to him, Pheebs.
I think it's endearing.
Oh, you do, do you?
There's nothing wrong with
speaking correctly.
lndeed there isn't.
I should get back to work.
Otherwise someone might
and the gloves come off.
Did you ever go out with a guy
your friends all really like?
No.
Well, I'm going out with a guy
my friends all really like.
Are we talking about the coyotes here?
All right! A cow got through.
Can you believe it?
It's just, you know what?
I just don't feel the ''thing. ''
They feel the thing.
the guy, dump him.
It's gonna be really hard.
He's a big boy.
He'll get over it.
No, he'll be fine. It's the other
five I'm worried about.
Don't you respect your body?
Don't you see what you're doing?
I've had it with you
and you know it.
Alan wants to speak to you.
Really? He does?
Hey, buddy! What's up?
She told you about that, huh?
Well, yeah. I have one now
and then. Well, yeah, now.
It's not that bad--
Well, that's true.
Gee, no one's ever put it
like that before.
Well, okay. Thanks.
God, he's good.
If only he were a woman.
Oh, Lamb Chop!
How old is that sock?
If I had a sock on my hand
somebody's nicotine patch.
Where's Joey?
Joey ate my last stick

Do you think that was wrong?
I think he's across the hall.
There you go.
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Pheebs, do you want
the rest of that Pop Tart?
Does anyone want
me $  for the thumb.
And on my way over here
I stepped in gum.
What is up with the universe?
What's going on?
Nothing. I think it's nice
when we're together.
It's even nicer when everyone
easy way to say this.
I've decided to break up with Alan.
Is there somebody else?
It's just. . .
. . .you know, things change.
People change.
We didn't change.
So that's it? It's over?
Just like that?
You let your guard down. You start
to care about someone, and I just--
-I can go on pretending--
to Alan, or to you.
Well, who wants fair?
I just want things back, you know,
the way they were.
I'm sorry.
Oh, she's sorry.
I feel better.
I just can't believe this!
With the holidays coming up.
There'll be other Alans.
Yeah, right!
Are you guys gonna be okay?
We'll be fine.
We're just gonna need a little time.
I understand.
I'm really sorry.
I mean, I'm sorry too.
But I'm a little relieved.
Relieved?
Well, l mean, l had
a great time with you.
I just can't stand your friends.
Remember when we went to
Central Park and rented boats?
That was fun.
He could row like a Viking.
So how'd it go?
You know.
Did he mention us?
He says he's really gonna
I'm getting cigarettes.
I don't care!
I'm weak! I've gotta smoke!
I've gotta have the smoke!
If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $ .
Yeah, all right.
<font color="#ffff" size=>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
- Hey, Phoebe.
- How did it go?
- Not so good.
He walked me home and said,
"Let's do this again."
He said, "Let's do this again."
means, "You'll never see me naked."
Since when?
Since always.
It's, like, dating language.
Like, "It's not you"
means, "It is you."
"You're nice" means, "I'll be
about them to you."
"We should see
"Ha-ha, I already am!"
Everybody knows this?
Cushions the blow.
Like your parents
putting the dog to sleep..
and saying it went to a farm.
That's funny. Because our
in Connecticut?
The Milners had this
unbelievable farm.
They had horses and
rabbits to chase.
And it was..
Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!
The One With the Thumb
How does it feel knowing
my pain will be over.
But you'll live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die.
That was really good!
Thanks. Let's keep going.
So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?
I just wanna go back to my cell,
smokes in his cell alone.
- What?
- Relax your hand.
Let your wrist go.
Not so much!
All right. Now take a puff.
Right.
- Give it to me.
- I'm not giving you a cigarette.
It's fine. Do you want to
of it as a cigarette.
Think of it as the thing that
has been missing from your hand.
When you hold it,
you feel right.
You feel complete.
- You miss it?
- No. You've got options.
You can smoke like this
- Chandler
- Or hold it in your mouth.
Give me the cigarette!
- You try.
- Thank you.
Okay, how's this?
Okay, that's not bad.
All right, when you're finished,
from the tip of a guy's thumb..
to the tip of his index finger.
That's ridiculous.
Can I use either thumb?
I'd rather go with the foot theory.
All right. Don't tell me.
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.
Coffee, black.
Latte.
And an iced tea.
- I'm getting good at this.
- Excellent!
Good for me!
- You okay, Phoebe?
- It's not worth
It's my bank.
- What did they do?
open their monthly "statement."
Easy!
And there's $ extra in my account.
Satan's minions at work again!
Now I have to go deal with them
- What are you talking about? Keep it!
- It's not mine.
If I kept it, I'd be stealing.
But if you spent it,
it would be like shopping.
Say I bought a great pair of shoes.
Know what I'd hear with every step?
and skipping, I'd hear
"Not-not mine. Not-not mine."
We're with you. We got it.
I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be this giant karmic debt.
Chandler, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Oh, gross!
- What is this?
- I'm smoking!
You've been so good for three years!
And this is my reward.
Think about what you went
what we went through!
So this time I won't quit.
- Put it out!
- I'm putting it out!
Oh, no!
I can't drink this now.
I'm gonna go. I've got a date.
With Alan again?
How's it going?
It's going pretty good.
- Come on!
Not after what happened with Steve.
What do you mean?
We love Steve. Steve was sexy!
Sorry.
I don't know how I feel yet.
Let me figure it out.
Then can we meet him?
No.
Sorry.
Joey. Let it go.
Why should they meet him?
I bring a guy home and they're like..
coyotes picking off the weak
more than her share of bad beef..
I'll tell you,
that is not such a terrible thing.
Your friends are just
looking after you.
I wish that once I'd date a guy
happening are slimmer..
- if they never get to meet the guy.
- I know.
- Can't I whimper a little bit?
- Whimper.
Okay, I'm done.
Let it go, Ross.
You didn't know Chi-Chi.
- Do you all promise?
filter-tip buddy stays outside!
"Dear Ms. Buffay.
Thank you for calling.
We've credited you $.
We're sorry for the inconvenience..
and hope you'll accept
Do you believe it?
Now I have $ 
and a football phone.
What bank is this?
Okay, it's him.
- Who is it?
- Alan.
Chandler! He's here!
Do I look okay?
One more button.
Closed! How about closed?
- I didn't know.
Everybody, this is Alan.
I've heard so much about
all you guys.
I'll call you tomorrow. Thanks.
Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.
Who's gonna take the first shot?
Come on!
I'll go.
Let's start with how he
kept picking
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
I'm going out with?
That pimento trick!
I'll never look at an olive
the same way again.
And did you notice?
Know what was great?
His smile was crooked.
- Yes! Like the man in the shoe!
With a crooked smile
Who lived in a shoe
For a while
So I think Alan..
is the yardstick by which
future boyfriends will be measured.
Future boyfriends?
- I think this could be "it."
David Hasselhoff impression alone.
You know I'll be doing that
at parties.
- Know what I like most?
- What?
The way he makes me feel about myself.
How was the game?
Well..
We won!
Fantastic! Question.
- He was unbelievable!
Like the cartoon where
Bugs Bunny plays every position.
It was first base, Alan.
Second base, Alan..
It was like he made us into a team.
We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers
You can never be too "Alan."
It's his innate "Alan-ness"
that we adore.
I, personally, could have
a gallon of Alan.
- Hey, Lizzy.
- Pick out the vowels?
I left in the Y's.
Because, "sometimes Y."
- And something else.
- Saltines?
No, $ and a football phone.
What?
Oh, my God!
- There's really money in here.
I don't want it.
- I have to give you something.
- No, you don't
- Do you want my tinfoil hat?
- No, you need that.
- It's okay. Thanks.
a soda and we're even. Okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Keep the change.
Thanks, Lizzy.
Want a pretzel?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
- See you.
A thumb?
I know. There it was,
Like "collect all five."
- Does anyone wanna see?
- No, thanks!
Don't do that. Come on!
It's worse than the thumb.
- This is so unfair.
- Why is it unfair?
So I have a flaw! Big deal!
Joey's knuckle-cracking
I mean, what the hell is that thing?
I accept those flaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?
Does the knuckle-cracking
bother everybody, or just him?
I could live without it.
Is it a little annoying? Or is it like
I think it's endearing.
Oh, you do, do you?
There's nothing wrong with
speaking correctly.
Indeed there isn't.
I should get back to work.
Otherwise someone might
get what they ordered.
The hair comes out
your friends really like?
No.
I'm going out with a guy
my friends really like.
Are we talking about the coyotes here?
All right! A cow got through.
Can you believe it?
It's just, you know what?
I just don't feel the "thing."
They feel the thing. I don't feel it.
Honey, you should always
feel the thing.
If that's how you feel about the guy,
- He'll get over it.
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five
I'm worried about.
- Don't you respect your body?
- Don't you see what you're doing?
I've had it with your cancer,
and you know it.
Alan wants to speak to you.
Really? He does?
Hey, buddy! What's up?
She told you about that, huh?
Well, yeah. I have one now and then.
Well, yeah, now.
It's not that
Well, that's true.
Gee, you know, no one's ever put it
like that before.
Well, okay. Thanks.
God, he's good.
- If only he were a woman.
for  years, it'd be talking too.
I think it's time to change somebody's
nicotine patch.
- Where's Joey?
- Joey ate my last stick of gum..
so I killed him.
Do you think that was wrong?
- I think he's across the hall.
the rest of that Pop-Tart?
Does anyone want
the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Hey, I might.
I'm sorry.
The soda people gave me $
for the thumb.
And on my way over here
- It's just nice when we're together.
It's nicer when everyone
gets to wear underwear.
Please, guys, we have to talk.
Wait! I'm getting a deja vu.
No, I'm not.
- We have to talk.
- There it is!
Okay, it's about Alan.
Speaking of which, tell him
there's something you should know.
There's really no easy way
to say this.
I've decided to break up with Alan.
Is there somebody else?
No, it's just..
you know, things change.
People change.
We didn't change.
So that's it? It's over?
Just like that?
You let your guard down. You start
- Okay!
No.
That wouldn't be fair to me, Alan,
or to you.
Well, who wants fair?
I just want things back, you know,
the way they were.
- I'm sorry.
I wanted him to meet my family.
I'll meet someone.
There'll be other Alans.
Yeah, right!
- Are you guys gonna be okay?
- We'll be fine.
We're just gonna need a little time.
I understand.
- Wow.
- Relieved?
Yeah, well, I mean,
I had a great time with you.
I just can't stand your friends.
Remember when we went to Central Park
and rented boats?
That was fun.
He could row like a Viking.
So how'd it go?
You know.
Did he mention us?
He says he's really gonna
- You have no idea.
Come here.
- That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
- No!
I don't care! I'm weak!
I've gotta have the smoke!
If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $.
Yeah, all right.

All right, Phoebe?
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want world peace...
...no hunger, good things
I'd make myself omnipotent forever.
There's always one guy.
"lf I had a
wish, I'd wish for three more wishes. "
Hey, Joey.
What would you do
if you were omnipotent?
Probably kill myself.
Excuse me?
If little Joey's dead,
thought it was a theoretical question.
FRIENDS
How does she do that?
I can't sleep in a public place.
Would you look at her?
She is so peaceful.
What? What? What?
Hi.
It's okay. You just nodded off again.
What's going on?
I got no sleep last night.
My grandmother has a new boyfriend...
and they' re both kind of insecure
in bed,
so And deaf.
They reassure each other
steps
from our place to here.
You got way too much free time, man.
There's the birthday boy.
Ross, check it out!
Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins

Happy birthday, pal!
We love you, man.
It's funny.

So?
So you had an extra ticket...

who
Mr. The-Glass-ls-Half-Empty?
Oh, my God!
Is today the th?
 October th?
I hoped you wouldn't remember.
What's wrong with the th?
Eleven days before Halloween.
All the good costumes are gone?
Today's the day Carol and I first...

Sex.
I better pass on the game.
I'm just gonna go home and think about
Let's all do that!
Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice!
Guys' night out!
Come on, what do you say, big guy?
What are you doing?
I have no idea.
Come on, Ross.
Maybe it will take my mind off it.
Promise to buy me a big foam finger?
Hi, me!
I remember when
I got my first paycheck.
There was a cave-in in a mine,
and eight people were killed.
You worked in a mine?
No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?
Isn't this exciting? I earned this.
I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk.
And it was totally...
... not worth it.
What's FlCA?
Chandler, look at that.
This is not that bad.
You're fine, yeah, for a first job.
You can totally,
totally live on this.
By the way, great service today.
- Incredible!
- Excelent!
Hockey!
Hockey!
Rachel?
Oh, my God!
I swear I've seen birds
and your mom said you work here,
aaand it's true!
Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play.
Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
So what's going on with you?
Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm?
And while we're on the subject of news..
Look, look, I have elbows!
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
We'll take a brief time out while Messier
Peaches?
Actually, nectarines, but basically...
Could've been a peach.
Then, uh, then we got dressed,
and I... I... I walked her to the...
...the bus stop...
I'm fine.
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!
What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
So c'mon, you guys,
tell me all the dirt!
Well, the biggest news is still
you dumping Barry at the altar!
Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
When are you coming home?
I've got this job...
Waitressing?
Okay, I'm not just waitressing.
I'm.. I, um...
I'm.. I, um...
I write the specials on the specials board,
I take the uh dead flowers
out of the vase...
Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put
us about the blobbies.
Hey, Rach.
How was it with your friends?
Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
What's that?
Weeeell, it's rum, and...
Okay.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight
so we can't operate.
But we can prep the guy!
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Could you please tell me
what this is in reference to?
Yes, hold on.
Um, they say there's been some
unusual activity on your account.
But I haven't used my card in weeks!
That is the unusual activity.
Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay..
they wanna know if I'm okay,
the FICA guys took all my money,
everyone I know is either getting married,
or getting pregnant,
or getting promoted,
and I'm getting coffee!
And it's not even for me!
So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay,
Uh... oh.
What? There was ice
there that night with Carol?
Plastic seats?
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
No, actually I was just saying it
there was ice there that night...
It was the first frost...
C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
You should feel great about yourself!
You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Monica, what is so amazing?
I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
You are just like Jack.
...Jack from downstairs?
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Ah, the other Jack.
Yeah, right! See, he gave up something,
but then he got those magic beans.
And then he woke up, and there was this,
this big plant outside his window,
full of possibilities and stuff...
And he lived in a village,
and you live in the Village.
Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up  a cow,
I gave up an orthodontist.
Okay, I... I... I know, I know I didn't love him...
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
But see, it was a plan.
and now everything's just kinda like...
Floopy?
So what, you're not the only one.
I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going.
You've just gotta figure at some point
it's all gonna come together,
and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Oh, like that's a word.
Okay, but Monica, what if... what if it
what if we don't get magic beans?
I mean, what if all we've got are...
...beans?
Get him! GET HIM! Get him!
Get- YESSS!
Not laughing now, are ya pal!
See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of
toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Pass it!
Pass it!
He's open!
Shoot! Shoot!
completely satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Listen, it's kind of an emergency.
Well, I guess you know that,
or we'd be in the predicament room.
Hold on.
Fill these out, sit over there.
Look, I don't wanna make any trouble,
okay,
but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright?
I didn't mean to bring you down.
No, you were right.
I don't have a plan.
Pizza guy!
Thank God.
Food.
Phoebe?
What?
Do you have a plan?
I don't even have a 'pl'.
Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
No, no, that's not what we ordered...
We ordered a fat-free
I must have given him yours.
Oh, bonehead, bonehead!
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean
guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
And... and a power tie?
No, pretty much just a towel.
Oh God.
So you guys want me to take this back?
Are you nuts?!
We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
Big Bird's friend.
I see pizza!
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
Hello? Who are we spying on?
White House adviser?
sexy smile, really cute butt?
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Please tell me it's his mother.
Definitely not his mother.
Oh, no...
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor...
she's walking... she's walking...
she's going for the pizza...
Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Excuse me,
look, we've been here for over an hour,
Who's he sleeping with?
Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...
I know we both said some things
we didn't mean,
but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.
Y'know, I feel like I've lost her...
Light still out?
Yeah.
Oh. Maybe they're... napping.
Oh please, they're having sex.
Shut up!
So, whaddya think George is like?
I think he's shy.
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out.
And then... when you do...
he's a preppy animal.
I remember the moonlight
coming through the window...
and her face had the most
 incredible glow.
Yes, the moon, the glow,
painkillers over here, please?
He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today?
So you slept with her for
the first time, so what?
You slept with her for
seven years after that.
Look, it's just a little
That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the
twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Then what?
My first time with Carol
was...
What?
It was my first...
time.
With Carol?
So in your whole life,
you've only been with one...
Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake!
There was a whole bunch of stuff
ha haaaah!
Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
What?! You slept with Jason?
You'd already broken up.
How long?
A couple hours.
Oh, that's nice!
Okay, okay, okay, I got one!
Anyway...
The valentine Tommy Rollerson
left in your locker was really from me.
Excuse me?!
Hello? Like he was really
gonna send you one?
She was a big girl.
Really. Well, at least 'big girls'
don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
I was laughing! You made me laugh!
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel!
Please drop the
Man. Can you believe he's
only had sex with one woman?
I think it's great.
Y'know, it's sweet,
it's romantic...
Really?
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak...
Hey, buddy.
Hi.
great in Silence of the Lambs.
Oh come on, admit it!
All things considered, you had fun tonight.
Fun? Where was the fun?
Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part?
Where's my puck?
Oh, ah... the kid has it.
Finders keepers, losers weepers.
You gotta do it, man.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber,
you're glue, whatever...
can't do it.
Listen, uh... gimme back my puck.
S, claro que s.
'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
No! No!
Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
Now that was fun.
Okay, Right foot red.
Could've played Monopoly,
Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Alright.
Yes, this is Rachel.
Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know,
I... I haven't been using it much.
Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
Green. To the green.
I've got magic beans.
Never... never mind.
To the left, to the left... aww!
Ohhh... I'm fine.
All right, Phoebe?
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want world peace. . .
. . .no more hunger,
I'd make myself omnipotent forever.
There's always one guy. . . .
''If I had a wish, I'd wish
for three more wishes. ''
Hey, Joey.
What would you do
if you were omnipotent?
Probably kill myself.
Excuse me?
If little Joey's dead,
GELULA & CO., INC.
How does she do that?
I cannot sleep in a public place.
Would you look at her?
She's so peaceful.
What?
It's okay. You just nodded off again.
What's going on?
I got no sleep last night.
My grandmother has
this new boyfriend. . .
. . .and they're both
kind of insecure in bed, so--
And deaf.
They're constantly reassuring
  steps from our place to here.
You got way too much free time, man.
There's the birthday boy.
Check it out.
Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins
tonight and we're taking you.
Happy birthday!
We love you, man.
It's funny. My birthday
was seven months ago.
-So?
who got to bring a date?
Well, aren't we
Mr. ''The Glass is Half Empty. ''
Oh, my God!
Is today the th?
October th?
I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
What's wrong with the th?
Eleven days before Halloween?
about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
The hell with hockey!
Let's all do that!
Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice!
Guys night out! Come on,
what do you say, big guy? Huh?
-What are you doing?
take my mind off it.
-Promise to buy me a big foam finger?
-You got it.
Look, look!
My first paycheck!
Look at the window!
There's my name! Hi, me!
I remember when
I got my first paycheck.
There was a cave-in in a mine,
Why?
Isn't this exciting?
I earned this.
I wiped tables for it.
I steamed milk for it.
And it was totally. . .
. . .not worth it.
Who's FICA?
Chandler, look at that.
This is not that bad.
You're fine for a first job.
You can totally, totally
live on this.
By the way, great service today.
-Terrific!
-Excellent!
Hockey!
Hockey!
Rachel?
Oh, my God!
I swear I've seen birds

And while we're on
the subject of news. . . .
Look! I have elbows!
Passes it up to Leetch.
Leetch spots Messier in the crease.
Here's the pass!
We'll take a time-out while Messier
just like those the night. . .
. . .that we first. . . .
You know?
In fact, she. . .
. . .she never took them off.
It's because we--
Sorry.
What?
Peach pit.
Yes, bunny?
Peach pit.
-That night, we had--
-Peaches?
Actually, nectarines,
an ass like Carol's.

Come on, you guys.
Tell me all the dirt.
The biggest news is still you

-When are you coming home?
-What?
Guys, I'm not.
Come on. This is us.
I'm not.
This is what I'm doing now.
I've got this job.
Waitressing?
I'm not just waitressing.
I mean, I'm. . . .
I write the specials
out of the vase.
Sometimes Arturo lets me put the little
chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
Your mom didn't tell us
about the blobbies.
How was it with your friends?
Okay, how would you like
-Okay.
We thought since Phoebe's staying over
we'd have a slumber party.
We got trashy magazines.
We got cookie dough.
We got Twister.
And I brought Operation.
But I lost the tweezers
Ask them what they want.
Could you please tell me
what this is in reference to?
Yes, hold on.
There's been unusual
activity on your account.
But I haven't used my card in weeks.
That is the unusual activity.
They just wanna see if you're okay.
They wanna know if I'm okay?
They wanna know if I'm okay.

Everyone I know is either
getting married or pregnant. . .
. . .or promoted.
And I'm getting coffee.
And it's not even for me!
If that sounds like I'm okay,
-Sorry.
There was ice there
that night with Carol?
Plastic seats? Four thousand
angry Pittsburgh fans?
I was just saying it looks
there was ice there that night.
It was the first frost.
Just sit down. Sit.
You should feel great. You're doing
this amazing independent thing.
Monica, what is so amazing?
I gave up, like, everything.

I gave up an orthodontist.
Okay, I know I didn't love him. . . .
See, Jack did love the cow.
But, see, it was a plan.
It was clear.
Everything was figured out
and now everything's like. . . .
''Flupie''?
You're not the only one.
gonna come together. . .
. . .and it's just gonna be ''un-flupie. ''
Yeah, like that's a word.
Okay, but, Monica, what if
it doesn't come together?
Well, because you just--
I don't like this question.
See, you guys? What if we
are you, pal?
All you need are toothless guys
hitting each other with sticks.
Pass it! Pass it!
He's open!
Shoot it!
We're on that TV thing.
Excuse me?
It says to call if you're not completely
satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
It's kind of an emergency.
You know that, or we'd be
all right? My face is dented.
You'll have to wait your turn.
How long will it be?
Any minute now.
I'm so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.
No, you were right.
I don't have a plan.
Pizza guy!
-Thank God.
-Food!
-Phoebe?
with extra cheese!
Wait. You're not G. Stephanopolous?
Oh, man.
My dad's gonna kill me!
Wait!
Did you say. . .
. . .G. Stephanopolous?
It goes across the street.
I gave him yours.
Bonehead! Bonehead!
Was this a small Mediterranean guy
George Stephanopolous' pizza!
Who's George Snuffleupagus?
That's Big Bird's friend.
I see pizza!
I wanna see. Let me see.
Hello! Who are we spying on?
You know, the White House adviser?
Clinton's campaign guy.
The one with the great hair,
sexy smile, really cute butt.
Oh, him! The little guy.
-Oh, no!
She's walking across the floor.
She's walking, she's walking.
She's going for the pizza.
Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
Excuse me?
We've been here for over an hour,
and people less sick have gone in.
That guy with the toe thing?
Don't be mad.
I know we both said some things. . .
. . .we didn't mean. . .
. . .but that doesn't mean
we still don't love each other.
You know, I feel like I've lost her.
Lights still out?
Maybe they're napping.
Please. They're having sex.
Shut up!
So what do you think George is like?
I think he's shy.
I think you have to draw him out.
And then when you do. . .
. . .he's a preppy animal.
I remember the moonlight came in. . .
. . .through the open window,
and her face had the most. . .
. . .incredible glow.
Yes, the moon, the glow,
some painkillers over here, please?
He's right, enough already.
What is the big deal about today?
So you slept with her
for the first time.
So what? You slept with her
than that.
Is it that she left you? That she
left you for a woman that likes women?
Louder. There's a man on the  th
floor in a coma who didn't hear you.
Then what?
My first time with Carol was. . .
. . .was my. . . .
What?
It was my first. . .
. . .time.
With Carol?
So in your whole life,
we could've done tonight.
Okay, I got one.
Do you remember that vegetarian pt. . .
. . .that I made that you loved so much?
Well, unless goose is a vegetable!
Okay, fine. Now I don't feel so bad
about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
What? You slept with Jason?
You'd already broken up.
How long?
A couple hours.
Oh, that's nice!
Okay, okay, I got one!
Anyway. . . .
The valentine Tom left
in your locker was really from me!
Excuse me?
Hello! Like he was really
their pants in seventh grade!
I was laughing. You made me laugh!
Oh, my God! There he is!
There he is!
-Where?
-Where we've been looking all night.
-Oh, he's so cute.
only had sex with one woman?
I think it's great.
You know, it's sweet.
It's romantic.
Really?
No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.
I judge him.
Hey, buddy!
That's attractive.
I thought you were great
in Silence of the Lambs.
Admit it, all things considered,
which part was the fun part?
Where's my puck?
-The kid has it.
-The kid?
Excuse me, that's my puck.
I found it. Finders keepers,
losers weepers.
You gotta do it, man.
Oh, yeah? I'm rubber, you're glue.
Give me my puck.
No roughhousing in my ER!
Give me my puck!
Now that was fun.
Right foot, red.
Could've played Monopoly, but no!
Thanks.
Right hand, blue.
Good.
It's the VISA-card people.
Will you take my place?
All right. Yes, this is Rachel.
No, I know. I haven't been
using it much.
Well, thanks.
But I'm okay, really.
To the green.
I've got magic beans.
No, never mind.
To the left! To the left!
I'm fine.
<font color="#ffff" size=>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
I would want world peace...
...no hunger, good things
for the rain forest.
And bigger boobs.
Well, see, you took mine.
What about you?
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I'd make myself omnipotent forever.
There's always one guy. "lf I had a
if you were omnipotent?
Probably kill myself.
Excuse me?
If little Joey's dead,
then I got no reason to live.
Joey, omnipotent.
You are?
Ross, l' m sorry. I had no idea. I
thought it was a theoretical question.
The One With the George Stephanopoulos
How does she do that?
I can't sleep in a public place.
Libraries, airplanes,
to the Grand Canyon.
Mom and Dad took us
to the Grand Canyon?
Would you look at her?
She is so peaceful.
Yeah.
What? What? What?
-Hi.
grandmother has a new boyfriend...
...and they' re both kind of insecure
in bed, so And deaf.
They reassure each other
that they' re having a good time.
You have no idea how loud they are.
-You can stay with Rachel and me.
from our place to here.
You got way too much free time, man.
There's the birthday boy.
Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins
tonight and we're taking you.
-Happy birthday, pal!
-We love you, man.
It's funny. My birthday
-So you had an extra ticket...
...and couldn't decide
who got to bring a date?
Well, aren't we
Mr. The-Glass-ls-Half-Empty?
Oh, my God! Is today the th?
-What's wrong with the th?
Eleven days before Halloween.
All the good costumes are gone?
T oday's the day Carol and I first...
...consummated our...
... physical relationship.
Sex.
-You told your sister that?
-Believe me, I told everyone.
I better pass on the game.
I'm just gonna go home and think about
Let's all do that!
Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice!
Guys' night out!
Come on, what do you say, big guy?
-What are you doing?
-I have no idea.
-Come on, Ross.
-You got it.
Look, look, look! My first paycheck!
Look at the window!
There's my name! Hi, me!
I remember when
I got my first paycheck.
There was a cave-in in a mine,
-No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?
Isn't this exciting? I earned this.
I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk.
And it was totally...
... not worth it.
What's FlCA?
Why's he getting all my money?
I mean, what?
totally live on this.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
-By the way, great service today.
-Yeah.
-Hockey!
-Hockey!
-Hockey!

What are you doing here?
We were in the city shopping, and your
mom said you work here, and it's true!
Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play.
God, look at you! You're so big!
you've lost, like, a ton of weight.
And you should...
... really, really It's time to stop,
you look perfect.
What's going on?
Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm?
And while we're on
looks at some women's shoes.
Carol was wearing boots just like
those the night that we first....
You know? In fact, she....
She never took them off.
It's because we Sorry, sorry.
I can't believe
-What?
-Peach pit.
Yes, bunny?
Peach pit. That night, we had
-Peaches?
and I walked her to...
...the bus stop. I' m fine.
Hey, that woman's got
an ass like Carol's.
What? I thought we were
trying to find stuff.
Come on, you guys.
dumping Barry at the altar.
-Let's talk reality for a second.
-Okay.
-When are you coming home?
-What? Guys, l' m not.
-Come on. This is us.
I've got this job.
I even do my own laundry.
-This is what l' m doing now.
-Waitressing?
I' m not just waitressing.
I mean, l' m....
I write the specials
out of the vase.
Sometimes Arturo lets me put the
chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
Well, your mom didn't tell us
about the blobbies.
Hey, Rach.
some Tiki Death punch?
-What's that?
-Well, it's rum and
Okay.
Since Phoebe's staying,
we'll have a slumber party.
We got trashy magazines.
the tweezers so we can't operate.
But we can prep the guy.
-Rach, it's the Visa card people.
-Oh, God. Ask them what they want.
Could you please tell me
what this is in reference to?
There's been unusual
Okay, let's see.
Well, let's see.
The FlCA guys took all my money.
Everyone is getting married
or pregnant or promoted.
And I'm getting coffee.
then tell them I'm okay. Okay?
Rachel has left the building.
Can you call back?
All right! Come on!
Let's play Twister!
-Sorry.
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
There was ice that night with Carol?
we're not sitting together.
But now that you mention it,
there was ice that night.
It was the first frost.
Sit. Just sit down. Sit.
You're doing
this amazing independent thing.
Monica, what is so amazing?
I gave up, like, everything.
-Jack from downstairs?
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Ah, the other Jack.
Right. He gave up something
but then he got those magic beans.
And then he woke up
and there was this big plant...
...outside of his window,
and you live in the Village.
Okay. But, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow.
I gave up an orthodontist.
-Okay, I know I didn't love him....
-Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
But, see, it was a plan. It was clear.
Everything was figured out.
-Yeah.
We don't know where we' re going.
It's all gonna come together
and it's just gonna be un-floopy.
Yeah, like that's a word.
Okay. But Monica, what if
it doesn't come together?
Pheebs?
Well, because you just
What if we don't get magic beans?
I mean, what if all
we've got are beans?
Get him! Get him! Get him!
Yes! You're not laughing now,
are you, pal?
All you needed were guys
-Shoot it! Shoot it!
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing.
Excuse me?
It says to call if you're not
satisfied with this candy bar.
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Well, the label
promises nutty goodness.
It's an emergency. But you know that,
Sit over there!
I don't want to make any trouble
but I'm in a lot of pain.
-My face is dented.
-Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
-How long do you think it will be?
I didn't mean to bring you down.
No, you were right.
I don't have a plan.
-Pizza guy.
-Food!
-Phoebe?
-I don't even have a " pla. "
One mushroom, green pepper and onion?
No, no, no.
That's not what we ordered!
We ordered a fat-free crust
with extra cheese!
Wait. You' re not G. Stephanopoulos?
I gave him yours. Bonehead! Bonehead!
When you do that,
you're only hitting yourself.
Was this a small Mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks?
-That sounds right.
-No, pretty much just a towel.
-Oh, God!
-You guys want me to take this back?
What, are you nuts? We've got
George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Pheebs, who's George Snuffleupagus?
That's Big Bird's friend.
-I see pizza!
Clinton's campaign guy.
The one with the great hair,
sexy smile, cute butt.
Oh, him! The little guy.
Oh, I love him!
-Wait. Wait, I see a woman.
-Oh, no!
Wait, she's walking across the floor.
She's walking, she's walking....
She's going for the pizza
That's not for you, bitch!
We've been here for over an hour,
who's he sleeping with?
Oh, come on, Dora. Don't be mad.
I know we both said some things...
...we didn't mean but that doesn't
mean we still don't love each other.
You know, I feel like I've lost her.
-Come on, push me.
-No.
-Push me.
How about I push you like this?
Now you're gonna be in a wheelchair
the rest of your life, pally-wally....
I am so very sorry. Can I sign you?
-Lights still out?
-Yeah.
Well, maybe they' re napping.
-Please. They' re having sex.
-Yeah.
Yeah. I think you have
to draw him out.
And then when you do,
he's a preppy animal.
-What do you think of the guys?
-I feel funny talking about that.
-Oh, come on.
-Okay. Well....
I think Joey's like
a little kiddie ride.
You just have to put the quarter in
he helped me put on my coat...
...and he was really tender.
Come on, baby, come on. Let's go.
Yes!
Chandler's one of those repressed guys
who you'd have to seduce.
I think it's an act. Chandler is
more sophisticated than he seems.
-You know who's kind of sexy?
-No, guys. Please, he is my brother.
I know exactly what you mean.
He can be really smooth.
Can't you just picture him in bed?
I really don't want to.
Come on, laugh. Laugh.
I remember the moonlight coming in the
window, and her face had the most...
...incredible glow.
The moon, the glow,
over here, please?
He's right. Enough.
What's the big deal about today?
So you slept with her
for the first time.
You slept with her
for another woman that likes women?
Louder. There's a man on the  th
floor in a coma who didn't hear you.
Then, what?
My first time with Carol was...
...was my....
What?
It was my first time.
With Carol?
Oh.
So, in your whole life,
you've only been with one?
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.
There's a bunch of stuff
that vegetarian pate...
...that I made that you loved so much?
Well, unless goose is a vegetable!
Now I don't feel so bad
about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
-What? You slept with Jason?
-You had already broken up.
-How long?
-Okay, okay, okay, I got one!
Anyway, the valentine T om left in
your locker was really from me!
Excuse me?
Hello! Like he was really
gonna send you one.
She was a big girl!
Really? Well, at least big girls don't
-Where we've been looking all night.
-He's so cute.
-George, baby, drop the towel.
-Come on, drop the towel.
-Drop it. Will you please drop it?
Wow!
Man, can you believe
You know, it's sweet.
It's romantic.
Really?
You kidding? The guy's a freak.
I judge him.
-Hey, man!
-Hey, buddy!
Oh, that's attractive.
I thought you were great
you had fun tonight.
Fun? Where was the fun?
T ell me which part was fun.
Where's my puck?
-The kid has it.
-The kid
Excuse me, that's my puck.
I found it.
Whatever you
I can't do it.
-Listen, give me back my puck.
-No.
-Yes, how about?
-No.
-Give me my puck.
and Phoebe could be number two.
Nothing. It's a Twister thing.
The rules are on the back of the box.
Hello?
It's the Visa card people.
-Okay. Will you take my place?
-All right. This is Rachel.
No!
Hello? Oh, yeah. No, I know.
But l' m okay, really.
-To the green.
-Oh, no.
I've got magic beans.
No, no, never mind.

Let it go. It's not a big deal.
Not a big deal? It's amazing.
You reach in, there's one maneuver and bam!
A bra. Right out the sleeve.
As far as I know,
guys don't do anything 
that comes close. Right?
Come on!
You guys can pee standing up.
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.
Know what blows my mind?
Women can see breasts
anytime they want.
You look down,
is beyond me.
I don't get how guys can do
so many mean things...
...and not even care.
-Multiple orgasms!
-There you go.
FRIENDS
 The one with
Saturday night. Saturday night!
-No plans, huh?
-Not a one!
Not even breaking up with Janice?
Right, right. Shut up.
Chandler, nobody likes
breaking up with someone.
-You just gotta do it.
She has no idea.
You finally get up
the courage to do it.
There's that awkward moment
when you've handed her the note.
Why do you have to break up with her?
Be a man. Just stop calling.
If you want, I'll do it with you.
She'd feel like
I'll dump Tony.
You're breaking up with Tony?
He's sweet, but it's not fun anymore.
I don't know if it's me or
his hunger strike, I don't know.
Do you want anything else?
You had a nutty, chocolate-y,
kind of cake-y, pie thing that
Nothing. I' m fine.
What's wrong? Why so scrunchie?
My father wants to give me
if I move back home.
It was horrible!
He called me "young lady. "
I hate when my father
calls me that.
Did he say
with choruses of...
... "You'll Never Make it on Your Own. "
Hi, Joey.
Oh, my God! Angela!
Wow! Being dumped
by you agrees with her.
-Are you gonna go over there?
-No.
 Yeah. No.
Okay, but not yet.
That seems pretty cool.
-Hey, Angela.
-Joey.
You look good.
That's because l' m wearing a dress
that accents my boobs.
You don't say.
So, Rachel, what are you
Me and Monica at Launderama.
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?
Guess who's doing laundry there too?
-Who?
-Me!
Was that not clear?
Why don't...?
Why don't I just
join you both there?
Don't you have a laundry room
in my building.
But there's a rat problem.
Apparently, they're attracted
to dryer sheets.
They're going in fine,
but they're coming out all...
...fluffy.
-Anyway, -ish?
-Sure.
Forget it. I'm with Bob now.
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Bob is great.
He's smart, sophisticated, 
and you' re an actor. Bob...
Come on! We were great together.
And not just at the fun stuff,
but, like, talking too.
Sorry, Joey. You said,
" Let's be friends. "
So guess what?
-What?
dinner tonight? As friends.
What "four of us"?
You and Bob,
and me and my girlfriend...
...Monica.
I' m telling you,
this guy's perfect for you.
Forget it! Not after your cousin
His name's Bob. He's Angela's...
... brother.
He's smart, he's sophisticated...
...and he has a real job.
I go on three auditions a month
and say l' m an actor, but he's...
-God help us.
-What?
Ugly Naked Guy
You go out with tons of girls.
I know, but...
Look, I made a huge mistake.
I never should've broke up with her.
Will you help me? Please?
Monica's not coming.
It's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Hold on, camper.
The thinking-through is minimal.
Just you and Rachel?
Just you two?
This is a date.
You're going on a date.
What are you saying?
I should shave again?
the dirty underwear.
It's the first time she'll see
your underwear. You want it dirty?
And the fabric softener?
Okay, now what is wrong
with my Snuggles?
What? It says I'm a sensitive,
-There you go.
Thank you.
What does Bob look like?
Is he tall, short?
Yep.
Which?
Which what?
You've never met Bob, have you?
No, but...
For all we know, he's horribly...
Horribly attractive.
I'll be shutting up now.
Where are they?
do anything, just the two of us.
Great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent
a car, run over some puppies.
I don't wanna do that.
-Here we go.
-Have a good breakup.
-Hey, Janice.
and a latte over here?
We got the proofs from the shoot
with the vegetables.
They sucked.
I blew off the afternoon.
I went shopping.
And I got you...
I'm looking. I'm looking.
I' m looking.
-I got you
-What did you get me there?
I got you...
...these.
Bullwinkle socks.
-That's sweet.
-I knew you had Rockys.
You can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle
...or wear Rocky and Rocky,
or you can mix and match.
Moose and squirrel.
Whatever you want.
I'm gonna get another espresso.
using that machine.
Yeah, well, now you' re kind of not.
But I saved it.
I put my basket on top.
I'm sorry.
Is that your basket?
It's pretty.
just took my machine.
Was your basket on top?
-Yeah, but there were no suds.
-So?
You know, no suds, no save.
No suds, no... Excuse me.
Hold on a second!
This is my friend's machine.
Hey, hey, hey!
Her stuff wasn't in it!
Hey, hey, hey! That's not
I can't even send back soup.
Well, that's because you' re
such a sweet, gentle....
Do you? Do you?
Oh, hey. You must need detergent.
-What's that?
It's extra tough!
Rach, are you gonna separate those?
Oh, God.
Am I being a total laundry spaz?
Am I supposed to use one machine
for shirts and another for pants?
Have you never done this before?
Well, not myself.
But I know other people that have.
Okay. You caught me.
I'll use the gentle cycle.
Basically, you wanna use
one machine for all your whites.
A whole other machine
for your colors.
And a third for your...
...delicates.
or with delicates?
That would be a judgment call.
He's so cute!
Where did you grow up?
-Brooklyn Heights.
-Cleveland.
-How'd that happen?
-My God!
What?
I suddenly had the feeling
I was falling.
But I'm not.
So, you and Angela, huh?
-Yep. Pretty much.
smart and funny
who's emotionally older than .
You know what else?
He's unbelievable in bed!
My brother never even told me
when he lost his virginity.
That's nice.
You can. It's like
and then the wound is exposed.
Go! Go!
Hi, Janice.
Here we go. I don't think
we should go out anymore.
All right.
Well, there you go.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I know this is gonna sound stupid...
...but I feel that if I can do this...
...if I can actually do
my own laundry...
...there isn't anything I can't do.
That does not sound stupid to me.
The first time I had to cook
we have. Next on Ross....
-Uh-oh.
-What?
Uh-oh...
Uh-oh, the laundry's done.
It's a song.
The laundry song we sing.
Uh-oh! The laundry's done
What's the matter?
Nothing.
The laundry's done
Come on, show me.
It's just that you left a red sock
with your whites, and now...
...everything's kind of pink
Everything's pink?
Except for the red sock,
It can happen to anyone.
But it happened to me.
God, I'm gonna look like
a big Marshmallow Peep!
What am I doing?
My father's right!
I can't live on my own.
I can't even do laundry!
Something went wrong
 with Underdog
down Broadway, right?
And I'm thinking
how inappropriate this is.
Something's in my eye. Could we
check it in the light, please?
-Oh, my God!
-What?
Were we at the same table?
a little rambunctious with Ross.
Joey, this is sick.
It's disgusting. It's...
... not really true' is it?
Who's to say what's true?
What were you thinking?
l'm not proud of this, okay?
Well, maybe I am a little.
-l' m out of here!
-Wait!
You like him. I want her.
He likes you.
Really?
Yeah. If we put our heads together,
I can't believe I did this.
I couldn't stop laughing
at your Norman Mailer story.
Waiter? One more plate of
chicken wings over here.
Here's the thing.
You' re boom, boom, boom.
Oh, my God!
I' m so sorry!
Te encuentras bien?
It's just my lens. It's my lens.
I'll be right back.
I hit her in the eye!
In the eye!
This is the worst breakup
in the history of the world!
Oh, my God!
How many have you had?
I don't know. A million!
Chandler, easy, easy.
-All right.
l'm not fine. Here she is.
Wait here, okay? Breathe.
How do you do that?
It's like a gift.
We should always break up together.
I'd like that!
The clothes are clean.
That's the important part.
I guess. Except everything
looks like jammies now.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me. We had this cart.
I had a -inch waist.
Get out of my way.
I' m sorry. Maybe I wasn't
being clear. This was our cart.
There weren't clothes in it!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up rules!
Let go! Come on, it's my cart.
Listen, Mitzi, if you want it...
...you' re gonna have
ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you. I could not have
done this without you.
More clothes in the dryer?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
-Are you sure?
-Are you sure you' re okay?
-Yeah.
What a neat idea! All your
clothes match. I' m gonna do this.
How'd it go?
Excellent!
We ripped that couple apart
and kept the pieces for ourselves.
What a beautiful story.
I'm fine, by the way.
I'm sorry.
Where's Chandler?
He needed time to grieve.
I' m free! I' m free!
That ought to do it.
Would you let it go?
It's not a big deal.
Not a big deal?
little maneuver, and bam!
A bra. Right out the sleeve.
As far as I'm concerned. . .
. . .there is nothing a guy can do
that comes close. Right?
Come on!
You guys can pee standing up.
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.
You know what blows my mind?
Women can see breasts
anytime they want.
You just look down,
is beyond me.
What I don't get is the way
guys can do so many mean things. . .
. . .and then not even care.
Multiple orgasms!

-No plans, huh?
-Not a one!
Not even breaking up
with Janice?
Right, right. Shut up.
Chandler, nobody likes
-I know. But it's just so hard.
You're sitting with her.
She has no idea what's happening.
You finally get up
the courage to do it.
There's that awkward moment
we were ganging up on her.
You break up with Janice.
I'll break up with Tony.
You're breaking up with Tony?
He's sweet, but it's just
not fun anymore.
I don't know if it's me or
kind of cake-y, pie thing that--
Nothing. I'm fine.
What's the matter?
Why so scrunchie?
My father wants to give me
a Mercedes convertible.
That guy, he burns me up.
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes
He called me ''young lady. ''
I hate when my father
calls me that.
Did he give you that
''You're not up to this'' thing again?
I got the extended disco

-Are you gonna go over there?
-No.
Yeah. No.
Okay, but not yet.
I don't wanna seem too eager.

You don't say.
So, Rachel, what are you
doing tonight?
Big glamour night.
Me and Monica at Launderama.
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?
Guess who's doing laundry there too?
-Who?
join you both there?
Don't you have a laundry room
in your building?
I do have a laundry room
in my building.
But there's a rat problem.
Apparently, they're attracted to
but they're coming out all. . .
. . .fluffy.
Anyway, -ish?
Sure.
Forget it, Joey.
I'm with Bob now.
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Bob is great.
He's smart, sophisticated,
and he has a real job.
You go on three auditions a month
but, like, talking too.
Sorry, Joey. You said,
''Let's just be friends. ''
So guess what?
-What?
-We're just friends.
Fine. Fine.
Why don't the four of us have
and me and my girlfriend. . .
. . .Monica.
I'm telling you, this guy
is perfect for you.
Forget it! Not after your cousin
who could belch the alphabet.
Come on, this guy's great.
and call myself an actor, but Bob is--
-Oh, God help us.
-What?
Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile.
Look, I'm asking a favor here.
I'm thinking if I do this
for her brother. . .
. . .maybe Angela will come back to me.
What's going on here?
I never should've broke up with her.
Will you help me? Please?
Monica's not coming.
It's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Hold on there, camper.
You've thought this through?
It's laundry. The thinking
Just the two of you?
This is a date.
You're going on a date.
What are you saying?
I should shave again?
Pick up some wine?
Well, you may wanna rethink
underwear. You want it to be dirty?
And the fabric softener?
Now, what is wrong with my Snuggles?
What? It says I'm a sensitive,
warm kind of guy.
You know, like a little fuzzy bear.
I can pick something else
up on the way.
Thank you.
So what does this Bob guy
he could be horribly--
Horribly attractive.
I'll be shutting up now.
Where are they? Where are they?
This is nice. We never
do anything, just the two of us.
That's great. Maybe tomorrow we can
-Have a good breakup.
-Hey, Janice.
-My God, I am so glad you called me.
I had the most supremely awful day.
That's not good.
Can I get an espresso
and a latte over here, please?
We got the proofs from that
I went shopping.
And I got you. . . .
I'm looking. I'm looking.
I'm looking.
-I got you--
-What?
-What?
-What did you get me there?
I got you. . .
. . .these.
Bullwinkle socks.
-That's so sweet.
Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle. . .
. . .or wear Rocky and Rocky,
or you can mix and match.
Moose and squirrel.
Whatever you want.
I'm gonna get another espresso.
More latte?
No, I'm still working on mine.
That's it?
Yeah, it was really hard.
The hug looked pretty brutal.
You weren't there.
Coming through! Move! Move!
Excuse me! I was kind of
I put my basket on top.
I'm sorry.
Is that your basket?
It's really pretty.
Unfortunately, I don't see suds!
What?
No suds, no save, okay?
What's going on?
Nothing. This horrible woman
-So?
You know, no suds, no save.
No suds, no--
Excuse me.
Hold on a second!
This is my friend's machine.
Hey, hey, hey!
Her stuff wasn't in it!
Hey, hey, hey! That's not
I can't even send back soup.
Well, that's because you're

You must need detergent.

Have you never done this before?
Well, not myself.
But I know other people that have.
Okay. You caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin.
Don't worry.
one machine for all your whites.
A whole other machine
for your colors.
And a third for your. . .
. . .delicates.
And that would be your bras. . .
. . .and your underpanty things.
These are white cotton panties.
Would they go with whites
-Cleveland.
-How did that happen?
-Oh, my God!
What?
I suddenly had the feeling I was. . .
. . .falling.
But I'm not.
So, you and Angela, huh?
Yep. Pretty much.
You're a lucky man.
You know what I miss
the most about her?
That cute nibbley noise
who's smart and funny. . .
. . .and has an emotional age beyond .
You know what else?
He's unbelievable in bed!
My brother never even told me
when he lost his virginity.
That's nice.
You can do this. It's like
and then the wound is exposed.
Go! Go!
Hi, Janice.
I don't think we should
go out anymore.
All right.
Well, there you go.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I know this is gonna sound
really stupid. . .
. . .but I feel that if I can do this. . .
. . .if I can actually do
for myself after Carol left me. . . .
I'm sorry, that's all the time
we have. Next on Ross. . . .
-Uh-oh.
-What, ''uh-oh''?
Uh-oh. . . .
Uh-oh, the laundry's done.
It's a song.
The laundry song that we sing.
Uh-oh! The laundry's done
What's the matter?
Nothing. Nothing.
The laundry's done
Come on, show me.
It's just that you left a red sock
which is still red.
Don't be upset.
It can happen to anyone.
But it didn't.
It happened to me.
God, I'm gonna look like
I can't live on my own.
I can't even do laundry!
Something went wrong
with Underdog. . .
. . .and they couldn't get
his head to inflate.
So anyway. . .
. . .his head is, like,
check it in the light, please?
-Oh, my God!
-What?
Hello! Were we at
the same table? It's like. . .
. . .cocktails in Appalachia.
They're close.
Close? She's got her
rambunctious with Ross.
Joey, this is sick.
It's disgusting. It's. . .
. . .not really true, is it?
Who's to say what's true?
What were you thinking?
I'm not proud of this, okay?
Maybe I am a little.
-I'm out of here!
-Wait! Come on!
You like him. I want her.
He likes you.
Really?
I'm thinking, if we put our heads
I can't believe I did this.
I just couldn't stop laughing
at your Norman Mailer story.
Waiter? One more plate of
chicken wings over here.
Here's the thing.
You're the boom, boom, boom.
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry!
Are you okay?
It's just my lens. It's my lens.
I'll be right back.
I hit her in the eye!
I hit her in the eye!
This is the worst breakup
in the history of the world!
Oh, my God!
How many have you had?
I don't know. A million!
Chandler, easy, easy.
-All right.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Wait here, okay? Breathe.
How do you do that?
It's like a gift.
We should always break up together.
I'd like that!
You got the clothes clean.
That's the important part.
I guess. Except everything
looks like jammies now.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me. We had this cart.
I had a -inch waist.
Get out of my way.
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't
being clear. This was our cart.
There aren't any clothes in it!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up rules!
Let go! Come on, it's my cart.
Listen, Mitzi, if you
take me with it!
Yes! Did you see that?
You were incredible.
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.
I could not have
done this without you.
More clothes in the dryer?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
How'd it go?
Excellent!
We ripped that couple apart
and kept the pieces for ourselves.
What a beautiful story.
I'm fine, by the way.
I'm sorry.
Where's Chandler?
He needed some time to grieve.
I'm free! I'm free!

Except for Kevin Millmore,
may he rot in hell.
-You just gotta do it.
She has no idea.
You finally get up
the courage to do it.
There's that awkward moment
when you've handed her the note.
You try to run out of the restaurant

It's laundry.
Just you two?
This is a date.

Don't worry.
I'll use the gentle cycle.
Basically, you wanna use
one machine for all your whites.

That would be a judgment call.

This isn't about you.
I know! It's about
your fear of commitment.
I' m not afraid.
-Please.
-Really?
I know this is gonna sound stupid...
... but I feel that if I can do this...
...if I can actually do
my own laundry...
...there isn't anything I can't do.

for myself after Carol left me

My father's right!
I can't live on my own.
I can't even do laundry!
Something went wrong with Underdog
down Broadway, right?

Something's in my eye. Could we
check it in the light, please?

This is so exciting!
You can spot someone who's
No sense of impending doom.
The exclamation point scares me.

Ross, .
Is it? It feels like .
-No,  :!
at , ,  !
Hello!
She's amazing!
She makes the women l
dream about look like fat, bald men.
Go over.
She's not with anyone.
And what would my opening line be?
Excuse me...
Come on, she's a person.
Back me up.
He couldn't get a woman
like that in a million years.
You always see these beautiful
women with "nothing" guys.
You could be one of those guys.
-You could do that.
I'm considering this.
-l' m very aware of my tongue.
-Come on.
Here goes.
-Yes?
-Hi. Okay, next word would be...
... Chandler.
Chandler is my name and....
Hi!
Yes, you said that.
Yes! Yes, I did.
Thank you. Good night.
Chandler?
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!
What'd you think?
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!
It wasn't that bad.
At least you got to see my head.
-You're right.
-We saw your head.
She said yes!
She said yes!
Awful play, man!
Her name's Aurora. She's ltalian
The usher gave me this.
-What is it?
-The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.
An agency left its card.
They wanna sign me!
Based on this play?
Based on this play!
Hey kids!
It's been seven seconds, and you
She's had an amazing life!
<i>She was in the Israeli army.</i>
None of the bullets hit the engine,
so we made it to the border.
But just barely, and l....
I've been talking about myself
all night long. I'm sorry.
What about you? Tell me a story.
All right, once...
... I got on the subway.
And it was at night...
...and I rode it all the way
to Brooklyn.
Just for the hell of it.
We talked until :. It was perfect.
More or less.
Suddenly, we realized we were
-No.
I' m sorry. So you' re widowed?
Hopefully?
No, l' m still married.
So, how would your husband feel
about you sitting here with me...
...sliding your foot so far up my leg
you can count the change in my pocket?
Don't worry.
He'd be okay with you
do you imagine us having...
...if you have a husband
and a boyfriend?
I suppose, mainly sexual.
Sorry it didn't work out.
What, not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.
Didn't you listen to the story?
Didn't YOU listen? It's twisted!
How could you get involved
But I get the good stuff.
All the fun, all the talking,
all the sex...
...and none of the responsibility.
This is every guy's fantasy!
-That's not true!
-Ross, is this your fantasy?
No, of course not.
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
You'd go out with someone
I need to know...
... I' m going out
with more people than her.
You know...
monogamy can be
a tricky concept.
I mean, anthropologically speaking
Fine. Now you'll never know.
We're kidding. Tell us.
-We wanna know.
put forth by Richard Leakey
Are we greeting each other
this way now? I like it.
Look! I cleaned!
I did the windows.
I did the floors.
I used all the vacuum attachments
And we're not supposed to ask.
What do you think?
-It's very clean.
-Really, it looks great!
I see you moved the green ottoman.
How did that happen?
I don't know. It looked better there.
And it's an extra seat
around the table.
Yeah, it's interesting.
But you know what? Just for fun...
...Iet's see what it looked like
the green ottoman.
Be glad you didn't fan the magazines.
She'll scratch your eyes out.
You guys, I am not that bad!
Yeah, you are.
Remember, I lived with you?
You were a little....
That is so unfair!
When we were kids, yours was the only
Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.
Okay, so I'm responsible.
I'm organized.
But hey, I can be a kook!
All right, you madcap gal!
Imagine this.
The phone bill arrives,
go grocery shopping
And I buy detergent,
but it's not the one
with the easy-pour spout.
Why would someone do that?
One might wonder.
A glass is on the table with no coaster.
 A cold drink. A hot day.
Beads of condensation are inching
closer to the wood...
Stop it!
Oh, my God!
It's true. Who am l?
Monica, you're Mom.
Oh, my God!
Okay, I'll be there.
That was my agent.
My agent has just gotten me a job
they pull me back in! "
Come on. Seriously, Joey,
what's the part?
You' re.... What?
I' m his butt double, okay?
I play Al Pacino's butt.
All right? He goes into the shower,
and then...
... I' m his butt.
Oh, my God!
Come on, you guys.
It's a real Pacino movie
to the big opening?
So, will you invite us
to the big opening?
-I need some moisturizer.
-For what?
Today's the big day!
God. Go in the bathroom.
in there.
Thank you.
-Joey's mom's on the phone.
-ln the bathroom.
-You don't wanna go in there!
-Come on, we' re roommates.
My eyes!
Who is being loud?
Oh, that would be Monica.
Can I borrow stuff?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.
You got the whole night?
Well, I only have  minutes
until Ethan, so....
Do I sense resentment?
No. No resentment. Believe me...
...it's worth it, okay?
In a relationship, you have moments
you'll remember the rest of your life.
Every single second is like that
talking to you.
So, Monica, can you
help me with the door?
The old Monica would remind you...
...to scrub that Teflon pan with
a plastic brush.
But l' m not gonna do that.
Everybody ready?
I wanna thank you
the guy's upset here, you know?
His wife's dead,
his brother's missing.
I think his butt would be angry here.
I think his butt would like
to get the shot before lunch.
Once again, rolling.
Look at how happy they are.
-Oh, my God, l' m late!
-Oh, no!
-Don't go.
-Okay.
-I have to.
the following question, but....
And Andrew is?
He's...
... new.
So you' re not completely fulfilled
by Rick, Ethan and myself?
No, that's not exactly what I was
Most women would kill...
...for three guys like us.
So, what do you want?
You.
-You have me.
-No. Just you.
What do you mean?
Lose the other guys.
Like, all of them?
Come on, we' re great together.
to each other?
Up until tonight, I thought
that's what you wanted too.
Well, part of me wants that...
... but it's like l' m two guys.
One guy's saying, "This is great! "
But there's this other guy.
The guy who wells up
when the Grinch's heart grows...
...and breaks that measuring device.
He's saying, you know,
will you listen to?
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.
Which one?
The second guy.
I see.
Call me if you change your mind.
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Look at it this way. You dumped her!
Right? I mean, this woman was
unbelievably sexy...
...and beautiful, intelligent,
unattainable.
Tell me why you did this again?
Movie star!
Wait! Aren't you the guy who plays
for six years...
...and I finally get my shot,
and I blow it!
Maybe this wasn't it.
I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.
Did it feel like your shot?
Hard to tell. I was naked.
I don't think this was it.
I don't think you just get one.
I believe things are gonna happen
the day some kid will go
"l got the part!
I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass! "
You think? That's so nice.
I' m sorry, Joey.
I' m gonna go to bed, guys.
Good night.
You' re gonna leave
strewn about...
...in that reckless, haphazard manner?
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!
Whenever.
She is a kook.
<i>If it bothers you that much,
really early and put them back.</i>
<i>I need help!</i>

There's Joey's picture!
This is so exciting!
You can spot someone who's
never seen his plays.
Notice, no fear.
No sense of impending doom.
The exclamation point scares me.
It's not just Freud,
some excellent work here.
And I would have to say. . .
. . .your problem is quite clear.
All you want is a dinkle
What you envy's a schwang
A thing through which you can tinkle
To play with or simply let hang

I feel violated.
Did anybody else feel like
peeling their skin off. . .
. . .to have something else to do?
Ross,  :.
Is it? It feels like .
No,  :!
There's a beautiful woman
look like short, fat, bald men.
Go over to her.
She's not with anyone.
And what would my opening line be?
Excuse me. . . .
Come on, she's a person.
You can do it.
Could she be more out of my league?
like that in a million years.
But you always see these beautiful
women with these ''nothing'' guys.
You could be one of those guys.
-You could do that.
-You think?
Absolutely!
I can't believe
-Come on.
Here goes.
Okay, next word would be. . .
. . .Chandler.
Chandler is my name and. . . .
Hi!
Yes, you said that.
Yes! Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say. . .
. . .what I wanted to say was. . .
. . .would you like to go out with me?
Thank you. Good night.
Chandler?
There he is!
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!
Come on, it wasn't that bad.
I was the lead.
It was better than the troll thing.
At least you got to see my head.
-You're right.
and she pronounces my name ''Chandler. ''
I like that better.
The usher gave me this to give to you.
-What is it?
-The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.
An agency left me its card.
and this is just a line.
I've been here seven seconds, and you
haven't asked me how my date went.
How was your date, Chandler?
It was unbelievable!
I've never met anyone like her.
She's had the most amazing life!
She was in the Israeli army.
None of the bullets hit
all night long. I'm sorry.
What about you?
Tell me your stories.
All right, once. . .
. . .once I got on the subway, right?
And it was at night. . .
. . .and I rode it
all the way to Brooklyn. . .
. . .just for the hell of it.
We talked till .
we were in Yemen.
I'm sorry, so ''we'' is. . .?
''We'' is me and Rick.
Who's Rick?
Who's Rick?
My husband.
-Oh, so you're divorced?
-No.
I'm sorry. So you're widowed?
Hopefully?
No, I'm still married.
So how would your husband feel
so far up my leg. . .
. . .you can count
the change in my pocket?
Don't worry.
I imagine he'd be okay with you
because he's okay with Ethan.
Ethan? There's an Ethan?
Ethan is my. . .
. . .boyfriend.
What?!
What kind of relationship
a husband and a boyfriend?
I suppose, mainly sexual.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
What not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.
Didn't you listen to the story?
Didn't you listen to the story?
How could you get involved
with a woman like this?
I had trouble with it at first.
all the sex. . .
. . .and no responsibility.
This is every guy's fantasy!
That is not true.
Ross, is this your fantasy?
No, of course not.
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
You'd go out with someone else
who's going out with someone else?
I couldn't.
Good for you.
When I'm with a woman,
with more people than she is.
You know. . .
. . .monogamy can be a tricky concept.
I mean, anthropologically speaking. . . .
Fine. Now you'll never know.
We're kidding. Tell us.
-We wanna know.
-Come on!
All right. There's a theory
put forth by Richard Leakey--
Are we greeting each other
I did the floors.
I used all the attachments on
the vacuum except for that round one.
I don't know what it's for.
Nobody knows, and we're
not supposed to ask.
What do you think?
-It's very clean.
I thought it looked better there.
And also, it's an extra seat
around the coffee table.
Yeah, it's interesting.
But you know what? Just for fun. . .
. . .let's see what it looked like
in the old spot.
Just to compare.
Let's see.
Well, it looks good there too.
Let's leave it there for a while.
I can't believe you tried
fan out the magazines.
She'll scratch your eyes out.
You guys, I am not that bad!
Yeah, you are.
Remember, I lived with you?
You were a little, you know. . . .
That is so unfair!
When we were kids, yours was the only
Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.
Okay, so I'm responsible.
I'm organized.
But, hey, I can be a kook!
All right, you madcap gal!
Try to imagine this.
The phone bill arrives,
they send you a notice.
I could do that.
Okay, then you let me
go grocery shopping. . .
. . .and I buy laundry detergent.
But it's not the one
with the easy-pour spout.
Why would someone do that?
One might wonder.
A glass is on the table.
their way closer to the wood. . . .
Stop it!
Oh, my God!
It's true. Who am I?
Monica, you're Mom.
Oh, my God!
Okay, I'll be there.
That was my agent.
My agent has just gotten me a job
in the new Al Pacino movie!
That's great!
What's the part?
Can you believe this?
Al Pacino!
This guy's why I became an actor.
''I'm out of order?
they pull me back in! ''
Come on. Seriously,
Joey, what's the part?
You're, you're. . . .
What?
I'm his butt double, okay?
I play Al Pacino's butt.
All right? He goes
and Al Pacino's in it and that's big!
Oh, no, it's terrific.
After all your years of struggling. . .
. . .you've finally been able
to crack your way into show business.
Okay, fine.
Make jokes, I don't care.
This is a big break for me!
You're right. It is.
So are you gonna invite us all
-For what?
What do you think?
Today's the big day!
Okay, go into the bathroom.
Use whatever you want.
Just don't ever tell me
-He's in the bathroom.
-You don't wanna go in there!
-Come on, we're roommates.
My eyes! My eyes!
I warned you.
Who is being loud?
Oh, that would be Monica.
Can I borrow some things?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.
You got the whole night, huh?
Well, I only have  minutes
Believe me. . .
. . .it's worth it, okay?
In a relationship,
you have these key moments. . .
. . .you'll remember
for the rest of your life.
Well, every single second
 of them talking to you.
So, Monica, can you
help me with the door?
You know, the old Monica
would remind you. . .
. . .to scrub that Teflon pan
for this great opportunity.
Lose the robe.
Me?
That would work.
Right. Okay.
Losing the robe!
Okay, and the robe is lost.
Everybody, I would like
to get this in one take.
Let's roll it.
Water's working.
And action!
And cut!
Butt guy, what are you doing?
I'm showering.
No, that was clenching.
Well, the way I see it,
his brother's missing.
I think his butt would be angry here.
I think his butt would like
to get the shot before lunch.
Once again, rolling.
Water working.
And action!
And cut!
What was that?
I was going for quiet desperation.
But if you have to ask. . . .
God, I love these fingers.
Thank you.
No, actually, I meant my fingers.
Look at them.
-Oh, no, no, no.
-Don't go, don't go.
-Okay, okay.
-I have to.
-Look, she's leaving.
I'm sorry.
the whole day with you!
No, it's Andrew.
I know there'll be many moments. . .
. . .when I'll regret asking
the following question, but. . . .
And Andrew is. . .?
He's. . .
. . .new.
So you're not completely fulfilled
by Rick, Ethan and myself?
No, that's not exactly what I was--
Most women would kill. . .
. . .for three guys like us.
So what do you want?
You.
-You have me.
Why not?
Why can't we just have
what we have now?
Why can't we just talk,
laugh and make love. . .
. . .without feeling obligated
that's what you wanted too.
Well, part of me wants that. . .
. . .but it's like I'm two guys.
I mean, one guy's saying,
''Shut up! This is great! ''
But there's this other guy.
It's the guy who wells up
every time the Grinch's heart. . .
. . .grows three sizes
''This is too hard. Get out, get out! ''
So which one of the two guys
will you listen to?
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.
Which one?
The second guy.
I see.
Call me if you change your mind.
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Look at it this way.
intelligent, unattainable. . . .
Tell me why you did this again?
Movie star!
Aren't you the guy who plays
the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Nope.
No? What happened, big guy?
Big guy?
It felt like a ''big guy'' moment.
I got fired!
They said I acted too much with it.
I told everybody about this.
Everybody will be
expecting to see me.
You know what?
but crappy plays for six years. . .
. . .and I finally get my shot,
and I blow it!
Maybe this wasn't your shot.
I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.
Did it feel like your shot?
Hard to tell. I was naked.
I don't think this was your shot.
I don't even think
gonna happen for you. I do.
You've gotta keep thinking about
the day that some kid will go. . .
. . . ''I got the part! I'm gonna be
Joey Tribbiani's ass! ''
You think? That's so nice.
I'm sorry, Joey.
your shoes out here?
Really? Just casually
strewn about. . .
. . .in that reckless,
haphazard manner?
It doesn't matter.
just go out and get the shoes.
No, don 't do this!
This is stupid!
I don 't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna go get them.
But then everyone will know.
Unless I get them, and then wake up
really early and put them back.
I need help!

you know it's your shot.
Did it feel like your shot?
Hard to tell. I was naked.
I don't think this was it.
I don't think you just get one.
I believe things are gonna happen
the day some kid will go

You think? That's so nice.
I' m sorry, Joey.
I' m gonna go to bed, guys.

It doesn't matter.

I'm gonna get them.

Can you believe she actually
I thought maybe. . .
. . .possibly. . .
. . .you might be.
You did?
Then you spent Phoebe's birthday
party talking to my breasts. . .
. . .so then I figured maybe not.
Did any of the rest of you guys
think that when you first met me?
-I did.
-No, no, me neither.
Although back in college,
Susan Saladore did.
You're kidding.
-Did you tell her I wasn't?
-No.
It's because I wanted
you were seeing Bernie Spellman. . .
. . .who also liked her.
Well, this is fascinating.
So what is it about me?
I don't know. Because you're smart,
you're funny. . . .
So is Ross.
You ever think that about him?
Yeah, right!
What is it?
I don't know. You just--
you were gonna be vague about this.
It's Paolo calling from Rome.
Oh, my God! Calling from Rome!
So he's calling from Rome.
I could do that.
Just gotta go to Rome.
Your Dad just beeped in.
Can you make it quick?
I'm talking to Rome.
I'm talking to Rome.
Hey, Dad. What's up?
Oh, God.
Ross, it's Nana.
-How you doing?
it's a matter of hours.
-How are you, Mom?
-Me? I'm fine, fine.
I'm glad you're here.
What's with your hair?
What?
What's different?
Nothing.
Oh, maybe that's it.
She's unbelievable.
Her mother's--
Okay, relax.
We are gonna be here a while,
and your career to cover.
Oh, God!
The fuzzy little mints
at the bottom of her purse.
Yeah, they were gross.
You know what I love?
Her Sweet 'N Lows.
How she was always stealing them
from restaurants.
Not just from restaurants,
and Aunt Phyllis now.
Goodbye, Nana.
Bye, Nana.
Nurse!
What is going on?
You know how the nurse said
Nana had passed?
Well, she's not quite.
What?
She's not passed!
She's present! She's back!
What's going on?
She may have died.
''She may have died''?
We're looking into it.
I'll go see.
This almost never happens.
Now she's passed.
I just have to know, okay?
Is it my hair?
Yes, that's exactly what it is.
but I just don't feel. . . .
Maybe she's not really gone.
No, no, she's gone.
We checked.
A lot.
No, I mean, maybe no one
ever really goes.
Ever since my mom died,
every now and then. . .
. . .I get this feeling that she's,
from junior high. . .
. . .got struck by lightning
on a miniature golf course.
I always get this strong
Debbie vibe. . .
. . .whenever I use
-Sure.
I just sharpened her this morning.
I don't believe any of that.
I think when you're dead. . .
. . .you're dead. You're gone.
You're worm food.
So Chandler looks gay, huh?
I don't know who this is,
she can't look nice.
Sweetie, you think
you can get in there?
I don't see why not.
Here's my retainer!
I was just thinking. . .
-. . .when my time comes--
-Dad!
Listen to me!
When my time comes,
It looks like fun.
Define ''fun. ''
Come on. You'll make a day of it.
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch. . . .
And then we throw your body in
the water. Gee, that does sound fun.
Everyone thinks they know me.
Everyone says, ''Jack Geller,
''Buried at sea? Huh. ''
That's probably what they'll say.
I'd like that.
Hey, gorgeous.
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.
Don't worry about it. Apparently,
other people have made the same mistake.
Okay. Phew!
So what do you think it is about me?
I don't know what.
You just have. . .
-. . .a quality.
-A quality. Great.
It's a shame, because you and Lowell
That's who you saw me with?
What? He's cute.
Well, yeah.
He's no Brian in Payroll.
Is Brian. . .?
I don't know. The point is,
if you were gonna set me up. . .
. . .I'd like to think it'd be
with somebody like him.
I think Brian's
I could get a Brian?
Because I could get a Brian.
Believe you me.
I'm really not.
This one?
I've shown you every dress we have.
Unless you want her to spend eternity
in a lemon-yellow pantsuit. . .
. . .go with the burgundy.
Whatever we pick, she would've
We'll go with the burgundy.
A fine choice. I'm coming out.
Wait! We need shoes.
How about these?
That's really a day shoe.
And where she's going,
everyone else will be dressier?
Could we see something
in a slimmer heel?
I have nothing in an evening shoe
in a silver that may work.
No, it really should be burgundy.
Unless we go with a different dress.
No, no, no. Watch this.
Wait, I may have something in the back.
Oh, my God.
Is everything all right?
Just Nana's stuff.
How we doing?
You guys ready?
Mom called to remind me
not to wear my hair up.
Did you know my ears were not
I couldn't find my bearings.
You mean your earrings?
What did I say?
-Are these the shoes?
-Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
What? We don't have shoes here?
Morning. We ready to go?
Don't we look nice all dressed up?
It's stuff like that, isn't it?
-It was a really beautiful service.
-It really was.
Come here, sweetheart.
You know. . .
. . .I think it's time for you
remarkably like Brent Musburger.
Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.
You're watching football at a funeral?
No, it's the pregame.
I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
You're a frightening, frightening man.
Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes!
I hope they're not ruined.
God, what a great day!
What? Weatherwise.
I know.
The air, the trees.
Even though Nana's gone,
there's something almost life--
Ross, are you okay?
No, I'm fine.
Just. . .
. . .having my worst fear
if the muscle's in spasm.
-What? What is it?
-You missed a belt loop.
Okay, it's in spasm.
Here, sweetie. Here.
I took these when I had
my golfing accident.
Thanks, Mom.
Sorry.
Hi, I'm Andrea.
I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have
but the second two. . . .
I love you guys.
You guys are the greatest.
I love my sister.
I love Pheebs.
That's so nice.
I love you, man.
And listen,
if you wanna be gay, be gay!
It doesn't matter to me.
You were right.
I love you the most.
Well, you know who I love the most?
You!
Oh, you don't get it!
What do you got there?
Just a hearing disability.
What's the score?
 - , Giants.
hand me a cracker?
Your grandmother would've hated this.
Well, sure. What with it
being her funeral and all.
No, I'd be hearing about. . .
. . .why didn't I get
the honey-glazed ham.
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.
I don't need flowers, I'm dead. ''
That sounds like Nana.
Do you know what it's like
to grow up. . .
. . .with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?
I can imagine.
I tell you, it's a wonder
life-affirming person she is.
That is a wonder!
So tell me something, Mom.
If you had to do it all over again. . .
. . .I mean, if she was here right now. . .
. . .would you tell her?
Tell her what?
How she drove you crazy,
picking on every little detail.
Like your hair, for example.
I'm not sure I know
if you'd just told her the truth?
I think some things are
better left unsaid.
I think it's nicer when people
just get along.
More wine?
Oh, I think so.
Those earrings look
That is my penis.
Can we be grownups now?
Who are those people?
Got me.
That's Nana right there in the middle.
Yeah, let's see.
''Me and the gang at Java Joe's. ''
Monica, you look just like
your grandmother.
How old was she there?
Let's see, ''  . ''
Twenty-four, twenty-five.
It looks like a fun gang.
Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked!
Let me see!
No, no. That would be me again.
I'm just trying something.
Hey, Lowell.
Oh, hey, Chandler.
So how's it going in
the papier-mch heads.
How about you?
Good. Good. Listen. . .
. . .I don't know what Shelly told you
about me, but. . .
. . .I'm not.
I know. That's what I told her.
Really?
So you can tell?
Pretty much. Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.
So you don't think I have. . .
. . .a quaIity?
Speaking for my people,
from Payroll? He is.
He is?
And way out of your league.
Out of my league!
I could get a Brian. If I wanted to
get a Brian, I could get a Brian.
Hey, Brian.

Everybody! Central Perk
is proud to present. . .
. . .the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Thanks.
I wanna start with a song
that's about that moment. . .
. . .when you suddenly realize
GELULA & CO., INC.
This is so cool, you guys.
The entire city's blacked out.
Mom says it's Manhattan,
Brooklyn and Queens. . .
. . .and doesn't know when
it'll be back on.
You guys, this is big.
Pants and a sweater.
Eligible looters?
Can we talk about this later?
Can I borrow the phone?
I wanna call my apartment
and check on my grandma.
What's my number?
I never call me.
Oh, my God! It's her.
It's that Victoria Secret model.
Something Goodacre.
Hi, Mom, it's Jill.
She's right. It's Jill.
Jill Goodacre.
Oh, my God!
I am trapped in an A TM vestibule
Maybe it's an atrium?
Yeah, that is the part
to focus on, you idiot.
I'm fine. I'm just stuck
at the bank in an ATM vestibule.
Jill says vestibule...
...I'm going with vestibule.
I'm fine.
No, I'm not alone.
I don't know, some guy.
Oh, some guy. I am some guy.
Hey Jill, I saw you
is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Chandler's old roommate was Jewish, and
these are the only candles we have. . .
. . .so happy Hanukkah!
Look! Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.
That had to hurt!
All right, all right!
one word. Oh, God!
Do something!
Just make contact. Smile!
There you go.
You're definitely scaring her.
Would you like to call somebody?
Yeah, about  guys I went
to high school with.
Yeah, thanks.
It's me.
It's Chandler.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I'm stuck in an ATM vestibule. . .
. . .with Jill Goodacre.
What?
I'm stuck. . .
. . .in an ATM vestibule. . .
. . .with Jill Goodacre.
I have no idea what you said.
Put Joey on the phone.
What's up, man?
I'm stuck. . .
. . .in an ATM vestibule. . .
. . .with Jill Goodacre!
Oh, my God!
He's trapped in an ATM vestibule
never entered my mind.
Come on, somebody.
I'll go. I'll go.
Senior year of college,
on a pool table.
Pool table?
That's my sister.
My weirdest place would have to be. . .
. . .the women's room on the second floor
of the New York City Public Library.
Oh, my God! What were you
''It's a small world after all. ''
No way!
The ride broke down. . .
. . .so Carol and I went behind a couple
of those mechanical Dutch children.
They fixed the ride, and we were asked
never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Rachel?
I already went.
-You did not go.
-We have a winner!
I've never had a relationship
with that kind of passion.
Where you have to have somebody right
there in the middle of a theme park.
It was the only thing to do there
on a miniature golf course.
Come on.
He said we were holding up
the people behind us.
And you didn't marry him because. . .?
Do you think there are people
that go through life. . .
. . .never having that kind of. . .?
-Probably.
Passion is way overrated.
-Yeah, right.
-It is.
Eventually, it kind of burns out.
But hopefully what you're left
with is trust and security and. . . .
In my ex-wife's case,
on that passion thing. . .
. . .there's other good stuff.
But I don't think that'll be you.
You don't?
I see big passion in your future.
Really?
-You do?
-I do.
Ross, you're so great.
It's never gonna happen.
What?
You and Rachel.
Why not?
Because you waited too long
to make your move. . .
. . .and now you're in the ''Friend Zone. ''
I'm not in the Zone.
No, Ross.
a little bit closer to. . . .
Priesthood!
I'm telling you, she has
no idea what you're thinking.
If you don't ask her out soon,
you'll end up stuck in the Zone forever.
I will, I will.
I'm waiting for the right moment.
What?
What, now?
What's messing you up?
''Look, Rachel, I think--''
-What are we shushing?
-We're shushing. . .
. . .because we're trying to
hear something.
What?
Don't you hear that?
See?
Would you like some gum?
Is it sugarless?
-Sorry, it's not.
offers you gum, you take it.
If she offers you mangled
animal carcass, you take it!
New York City has no power
And the milk is getting sour
But to me it is not scary
'Cause I stay away from dairy
-Here goes.
-You'll do it?
-I'll do it.
you're a dead man.
Good luck, man.
Thanks.
-Where you going?
-Outside.
You can't!
Why not?
Because of the reason.
That would be. . .?
I can't tell you.
What's going on?
Listen. You gotta promise you'll
never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
-About what?
-Oh, stop it. Joey already told me.
Well, he didn't tell me.
Don't look at me.
This is Ross' thing.
This is so typical. I'm always
the last to know everything.
You are not. We tell you stuff.
I was the last one to know when Chandler
on Joey when he was moving in.
Looks like I was second to last.
It's so nice.
I have a question.
Actually, it's not
so much a question. . .
. . .it's more of a general wondering. . . .
--ment.
Here goes.
Well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to. . . .
Yes, that's right.
Look at that little kitty!
I'm on the top of the world
Ever since you've been around
All right, this is just Bactine.
It won't hurt.
Sorry, that was wax.
Poor little Tootie's scared.
We should find his owner.
Why not put ''poor little Tootie''
She'll get trampled.
On second thought,
gum would be perfection.
Gum would be perfection?
Gum would be perfection.
Could've said, ''Gum would be nice. ''
''I'll have a stick. '' But, no.
For me, gum is perfection.
I loathe myself!
Oh, no, the Mellons.
Are you sure?
It's my cat. Give me my cat.
Wait a minute. What's his name?
Bob-- Buttons.
Bob Buttons?
Bob Buttons.
Here, Bob Buttons.
You are a very bad man!
You owe me a cat.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Where did you go,
little kitty, kitty?
Come on, lucky sixes!
Everybody, this is Paolo.
Paolo, I want you to meet my friends.
This is Monica. . .
. . .and Joey. . .
. . .and Ross.
He doesn't speak much English.
Monopoly!
Look at that!
Where did Paolo come from?
Italy, I think.
No, I mean tonight, in the building?
Paolo's cat. Isn't that funny?
That is funny. And Rachel
keeps touching him.
I looked all over the building
and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
I found him.
Last to know again.
And I'm guessing, since nobody
told me, this is Paolo?
Paolo, this is Phoebe.
You betcha!
All right. Okay. What next?
Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.
It's got a boyish charm.
It's impish.
Here we go.
Nice going, imp!
It's okay. All I need to do is...
...reach over and put it
We're back on track and I'm...
...chewing someone else's gum.
This is not my gum!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
And now you're choking.
You all right?
Oh, my God!
You're choking!
Better?
Thank you. That was. . . .
That was. . . .
Perfection?
What'd he say that was so funny?
I have absolutely no idea.
That's classic.
My God, you guys!
What am I doing?
This is so un-me!
If you want, I'll do it.
I just wanna bite his bottom lip.
But I won't.
The first time he smiled at me. . .
. . .those seconds were more exciting
and we have nothing in common. . .
. . . .and we don't even speak
the same language. . .
. . .but God!
Listen. . . .
Listen, something you should know.
Rachel and I are. . . .
We're kind of a thing.
-Thing?
-Thing. Yes, thing.
You have the sex?
Technically, the sex is not being had.
Rachel and I should be. . . .
Well, Rachel and I
should be together.
And if you get in the. . . .
In bed?
No, not where I was going.
If you get in the way of us
becoming a thing. . .
. . .then I would be, well, very sad.
So do you. . .?
You do know a little English?
Little.
Do you know the word crap-weasel?
That's funny,
doing this. Watch, it's easy.
Ready?
Now try it.
You gotta whip it.
Look, look! The last candle's
about to burn out.
 , , , . . .
. . .minus , minus ,
minus . . . .
-Thank you.
to bring it up. . .
. . .but you have to throw
a party for Monica.
This has been fun.
Yes. Thanks for letting me
use your phone. . .
. . .and for saving my life.
Well, goodbye, Chandler.
I had a great blackout.
See you.

-You better act surprised.
-About what?
-My surprise party.
-What surprise party?
I'm always the last to know.
You are not. We tell you stuff.
I was the last one to know when
Chandler got bit by the peacock.
I was the last to know
you had a crush on Joey.
What?
Looks like I was second to last.
You had a crush on me?
All right. It wasn't a crush,
I thought you had nice arms.
Nice arms, huh?
Hey, Mon, l' m moving the chair.
Do anything for you?
With all the lights out
you can actually see the stars.
It's so nice.
I have a question.
Actually, it's not
so much a question.
It's more

-Ow!
-Sorry, that was wax.
Poor little T ooty's scared.
She'll get trampled.
Yeah?
Damage control. Get back to the gum.
Gum would be perfection.
Gum would be perfection?
Gum would be perfection.
Could've said,
"Gum would be nice. " But, no.
For me, gum is perfection.
I loathe myself!
Oh, no, they' re nuns.
They hate all living things.
Hi. We just found this cat,
-It's my cat. Give me my cat.

-Bob Buttons.

You are a very bad man!
You owe me a cat.

-Buona sera.
Wow!
Mon, wanna go for a ride

I'll bring my arms.
We can bring my wheelbarrow
for your teeth!
Come on, lucky sixes!
Everybody, this is Paolo.
Paolo, I want you to meet my friends.
-...and Joey...
-Hi.
-...and Ross.
Hi.
He doesn't speak much English.
Monopoly!
Look at that!
So, where did Paolo come from?
Italy, I think.
No, I mean tonight.
Suddenly, into our lives.
That cat turned out to be Paolo's cat.
And Rachel keeps touching him.
I looked all over and couldn't find
the kitty anywhere.
I found him. It was Paolo's cat.
Well, there you go.
Last to know again.
And I'm guessing, this is Paolo?
Paolo, this is Phoebe.
You betcha!
All right. Okay. What next?
Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.
It's got a boyish charm. It's impish.
Here we go.
Nice going, imp!
It's okay. All I need to do...
...is reach over and put it
We 're back on track and I'm...
... chewing someone else 's gum.
This is not my gum!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
And now you 're choking.
You all right?
My God! You' re choking!
-Better?
-Yes.
Thank you. That was....
-That was....
-I have absolutely no idea.
That's classic.
My God, you guys! What am I doing?
This is so un-me!
If you want, I'll do it.
I just wanna bite his bottom lip.
But I won't.
The first time he smiled at me...
...those seconds were more exciting
than weeks with Barry.
Did you rent mopeds?
Because I've heard
and we have nothing in common...
...and we don't even speak
the same language, but, God!
-Paolo, hi.
-Ross.
Listen....
Listen, something you should know.
Rachel and I are....
We' re kind of a thing.
-Thing?
-No.
No, technically the sex
is not being had. But that's....
But that's not the point.
The point is that
Rachel and I should be....
Well, Rachel and l
-No.
No, not where I was going.
If you get in the way of us
becoming a thing...
...then I would be, well, very sad.
So, do you...?
-So you do know a little English?
-Little.
-Do you know the word "crap-weasel "?
You are a huge crap-weasel.
We've been doing this
for an hour. It's easy.
Ready?
Okay? Now try it.
You gotta whip it.
Look, look. The last candle's
about to burn out.
T en, nine, eight, seven...
... minus , minus ,
-Thanks.
IKind of spooky without any lights.
Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.
This probably isn't the best time
to bring it up...
...but you have to throw
a party for Monica.
-This has been fun.
use your phone...
...and for saving my life.
Well, goodbye, Chandler.
I had a great blackout.
See you.
Hi, l' m account number  .
I don't know if you got that...

like a copy of the tape.

Hey, gorgeous! How's it going?
Dehydrated Japanese noodles
under fluorescent lights.
Does it get better than this?
Question: You're not dating, are you?
I met somebody who would be
or self-destructive. . . .
-You want a date Saturday?
-Yes, please.
He is cute.
-He's funny. He's--
-He's a he?
Well, yeah.
Oh, God!
I just--
You're nice-- Oh, God.
Good, Shelly. I'm gonna go
MORPZ fuckyeah. Inc.
It's hard to enjoy Ramen noodles
after that. Is that ridiculous?
Can you believe she actually
thought that?
When I first met you,
party talking to my breasts. . .
. . .so then I figured maybe not.
Did any of the rest of you guys
think that when you first met me?
-I did.
-I think so.
-Not me.
Susan Saladore did.
You're kidding.
-Did you tell her I wasn't?
-No.
It's because I wanted
to go out with her too.
So I told her, actually,
you're funny. . . .
So is Ross.
You ever think that about him?
Yeah, right!
What is it?
I don't know. You just--
You have a quality.
Yes, exactly.
Yeah, a quality.
''A quality. '' Good. I was worried
I could do that.
Just gotta go to Rome.
Your Dad just beeped in.
Can you make it quick?
I'm talking to Rome.
I'm talking to Rome.
Hey, Dad. What's up?
Oh, God.
Ross, it's Nana.
-How you doing?
-Hey, Dad.
How's she doing?
The doctor says
-Me? I'm fine, fine.
I'm glad you're here.
What's with your hair?
What?
What's different?
Nothing.
Oh, maybe that's it.
She's unbelievable.
Her mother's--
Okay, relax.
We are gonna be here a while,
it looks like.
We still have boyfriends
at the bottom of her purse.
Yeah, they were gross.
You know what I love?
Her Sweet 'N Lows.
How she was always stealing them
from restaurants.
Not just from restaurants,
from our house.
Mrs. Geller?
She looks so small.
I know.
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop
Nana had passed?
Well, she's not quite.
What?
She's not passed!
She's present! She's back!
What's going on?
She may have died.
''She may have died''?
We're looking into it.
I'll go see.
This almost never happens.
Now she's passed.
I just have to know, okay?
Is it my hair?
Yes, that's exactly what it is.
It's your hair.
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
So did she. . .?
Twice.
Oh, that sucks.
You guys okay?
I don't know. It's weird.
I know she's gone,
ever really goes.
Ever since my mom died,
every now and then. . .
. . .I get this feeling that she's,
like, right here, you know?
And Debbie, my best friend
on a miniature golf course.
I always get this strong
Debbie vibe. . .
. . .whenever I use
a little yellow pencil.
I miss her.
Here, Pheebs.
Want this?
-Oh, thanks.
I think when you're dead. . .
. . .you're dead. You're gone.
You're worm food.
So Chandler looks gay, huh?
I don't know who this is,
but it's not Debbie.
I thought it'd be a closed casket.
Well, that doesn't mean
you can get in there?
I don't see why not.
Here's my retainer!
I was just thinking. . .
-. . .when my time comes--
-Dad!
Listen to me!
When my time comes,
I wanna be buried at sea.
You what?
I wanna be buried at sea.
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch. . . .
And then we throw your body in
the water. Gee, that does sound fun.
Everyone thinks they know me.
Everyone says, ''Jack Geller,
so predictable. ''
Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say,
other people have made the same mistake.
Okay. Phew!
So what do you think it is about me?
I don't know what.
You just have. . .
-. . .a quality.
-A quality. Great.
It's a shame, because you and Lowell
would've made a great couple.
Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?
if you were gonna set me up. . .
. . .I'd like to think it'd be
with somebody like him.
I think Brian's
a little out of your league.
Excuse me. You don't think
Believe you me.
I'm really not.
This one?
I've shown you every dress we have.
Unless you want her to spend eternity
in a lemon-yellow pantsuit. . .
. . .go with the burgundy.
Whatever we pick, she would've
told us it's the wrong one.
You're right.
everyone else will be dressier?
Could we see something
in a slimmer heel?
I have nothing in an evening shoe
in the burgundy.
I can show you something
You guys ready?
Mom called to remind me
not to wear my hair up.
Did you know my ears were not
my best feature?
Some days it's all I can think about.
Hi! I'm sorry I'm late.
-Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
What? We don't have shoes here?
Morning. We ready to go?
Don't we look nice all dressed up?
It's stuff like that, isn't it?
-It was a really beautiful service.
-It really was.
Come here, sweetheart.
You know. . .
. . .I think it's time for you
to start using night cream.
What?
Nothing. Just your overcoat sounds
I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
You're a frightening, frightening man.
Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes!
I hope they're not ruined.
God, what a great day!
What? Weatherwise.
I know.
The air, the trees.
Even though Nana's gone,
there's something almost life--
Ross, are you okay?
No, I'm fine.
Just. . .
. . .having my worst fear
realized, but. . . .
I'm just checking to see
-You missed a belt loop.
Okay, it's in spasm.
Here, sweetie. Here.
I took these when I had
my golfing accident.
Thanks, Mom.
Sorry.
Hi, I'm Andrea.
I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have
no idea who Dorothy is.
Look who's up!
How do you feel?
I feel great.
I feel great. I feel great.
Wow, those pills really worked.
Yeah. Not the first two,
I love my sister.
I love Pheebs.
That's so nice.
I love you, man.
And listen,
if you wanna be gay, be gay!
It doesn't matter to me.
You were right.
I love you the most.
Well, you know who I love the most?
You!
Oh, you don't get it!
What do you got there?
Just a hearing disability.
What's the score?
 - , Giants.
Three minutes to go in the third.
Beautiful!
Pheebs, could you maybe
being her funeral and all.
No, I'd be hearing about. . .
. . .why didn't I get
the honey-glazed ham.
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.
If I spent more, she'd say. . .
. . . ''Why waste your money?
to grow up. . .
. . .with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?
I can imagine.
I tell you, it's a wonder
your mother turned out. . .
. . .to be the positive,
If you had to do it all over again. . .
. . .I mean, if she was here right now. . .
. . .would you tell her?
Tell her what?
How she drove you crazy,
picking on every little detail.
Like your hair, for example.
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at.
Would things have been better
better left unsaid.
I think it's nicer when people
just get along.
More wine?
Oh, I think so.
Those earrings look
really lovely on you.
Thank you.
They're yours.
Actually, they were Nana's.
Now I'm depressed!
Even more than I was.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?
That little naked guy would be me.
Look at the little thing!
Yes, fine.
your grandmother.
How old was she there?
Let's see, ''  . ''
Twenty-four, twenty-five.
It looks like a fun gang.
Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked!
Let me see!
No, no. That would be me again.
I'm just trying something.
Hey, Lowell.
Oh, hey, Chandler.
So how's it going in
Financial Services?
It's like Mardi gras without
about me, but. . .
. . .I'm not.
I know. That's what I told her.
Really?
So you can tell?
Pretty much. Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.
So you don't think I have. . .
. . .a quaIity?
Speaking for my people,
I'd have to say no.
By the way, your friend, Brian,
get a Brian, I could get a Brian.
Hey, Brian.

Does it get better than this?
Question You're not dating, are you?
I met somebody who would be
perfect for you.
You see, perfect might be a problem.
Had you said co-dependent
or self-destructive. . . .
-You want a date Saturday?
-He's a he?
Well, yeah.
Oh, God!
I just--
You're nice-- Oh, God.
Good, Shelly. I'm gonna go
flush myself down the toilet now.
Okay. Bye-bye.

Just Nana's stuff.
You guys ready?
Mom called to tell me
not to wear my hair up.
-Know my ears aren't my best feature?
-Some days it's all I can think about.
I' m sorry l' m late.
-Yes. Paolo sent them from ltaly.
What? We don't have shoes here?
-Morning. We ready to go?
-Don't we look nice all dressed up?
It's stuff like that, isn't it?
-lt was a really beautiful service.
-lt really was.
Come here, sweetheart.
You know, I think it's time for you
sounds like Brent Musberger.
-Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.
-You're watching football at a funeral?
No, it's the pre-game.
I' m gonna watch it at the reception.
You're a frightening, frightening man.
Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes!
I hope they're not ruined.
God, what a great day!
What? Weather-wise.
I know.
The air, the trees.
Even though Nana's gone,
realized, but....
I' m just checking to see
if the muscle's in spasm.
-What? What is it?
-You missed a belt loop.
Okay, it's in spasm.
Here, sweetie. I took these
no idea who Dorothy is.
Look who's up!
-How do you feel?
-I feel great.
I feel great. I feel great.
Wow, those pills really worked.
Yeah. Not the first two,
but the second two....
I love you guys.
You guys are the greatest.
if you wanna be gay, be gay!
It doesn't matter to me.
You were right.
I do love you.
Oh, Ross. I love you too.
Oh, no, I really love you.
I really love you.
Oh, you don't get it!
-What do you got there?
-Just a hearing disability.
What's the score?
 - , Giants.
Three minutes to go in the third.
Beautiful!
Pheebs, could you maybe
her funeral and all.
No, I'd be hearing about...
...why didn't I get
the honey-glazed ham.
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.
Or she'd say
"Why waste your money?
to grow up...
...with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?
I can imagine.
It's a wonder your mother
turned out...
...to be the positive,
If you had to do it all over again...
... I mean, if she was here
right now...
...would you tell her?
T ell her what?
How she drove you crazy,
picking on every little detail.
Like your hair, for example.
I'm not sure I know
if you'd just told her the truth?
Some things are better left unsaid.
It's nicer when people just get along.
More wine?
Oh, I think so.
Those earrings look
really lovely on you.
Thank you.
They're yours.
Actually, they were Nana's.
Now l' m depressed!
Even more than I was.
Oh, look. My first grade picture.
Please ignore the Dy-no-mite T -shirt.
-Hey, who's this little naked guy?
-That little naked guy would be me.
Look at the little thing!
Yes, fine.
-That's Nana right there in the middle.
Yeah, let's see.
" Me and the gang at Java Joe's. "
You look just like your grandmother.
How old was she?
Let's see, "  . "
Twenty-four, twenty-five.
It looks like a fun gang.
Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked!
Let me see!
No, no. That would be me again.
I'm just trying something.
Hey, Lowell.
Oh, hey, Chandler.
So how's it going in
the papier-mache heads.
How about you?
Good. Good. Listen...
...I don't know what Shelly told you
about me, but...
... I' m not.
I know. That's what I told her.
Really?
So you can tell?
Pretty much. Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.
So you don't think I have...
...a quality?
Speaking for my people,
from Payroll? He is.
-He is?
-And way out of your league.
Out of my league!
I could get a Brian. If I wanted to
get a Brian, I could get a Brian.
Hey, Brian.

This is your Thanksgiving dinner?
What is it with you
and this holiday?
I'm  years old.
I hate this story!
We've just finished
this part vividly--
--a mouthful of pumpkin pie.
And this is the moment my parents
tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh, my God!
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving
dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
We used to work together.
We did?
At Macy's. You're
-I'm serious!
You're amazing! You know when to
spritz. You know when to lay back.
Really? You don't know
what that means to me.
You smell great tonight.
-I remembered I have to do something.
What?
Leave.
Wait, wait, wait!
I guess you all saw it.
Saw what?
We're just laughing. You know
how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.
''Tonight, on a very special Blossom. ''
Looking good! Okay!
Cider's mulling, turkey's
the same without Mom in the kitchen.
That's it. Get out of
my way and stop annoying me!
Well, that's closer.
I got the tickets!
Five hours from now,
shoop, shoop, shoop!
Oh, you must stop shooping.
I'm gonna get my stuff.
Will you just come in, already?
I prefer to keep a safe distance
the stuffing, but that's not funny.
Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tater Tots.
That's not a question.
But my mom always makes them.
It's a tradition.
A piece of turkey on your fork,
my family, because of my disease.
All right. Fine.
Tonight's potatoes will be both
mashed with lumps. . .
. . .and in the form of Tots.
I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Mom never hit.
Okay, all done.
Phoebe, did you whip the pota--?
Ross needs lumps!
Oh, I'm sorry!
I just--
I thought we could have them whipped
my mom used to make it. . .
. . .before she died.
Three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Goodbye, you guys!
Thanks for everything!
Oh, God, look at-- Sorry!
I'm so sorry.
The most unbelievable thing has
happened! Underdog has gotten away!
The balloon?
No, the actual cartoon character.
Of course the balloon!
It's all over the news.
He broke free and was spotted
Who's with me?
I can't. I gotta go!
An -foot dog loose over the city?
How often does that happen?
Almost never.
Got the keys?
Anytime you're ready!
Okay, here we go.
Where am I talking to here?
There is one way that seems to offer
a certain acoustical advantage, but. . . .
Just aim for the bump.
Okay, here goes.
You know, I can't do this.
It's too weird. I feel stupid.
It's fine. You don't have to do it
shadow fall over the park!
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.
Right about now the turkey should
be crispy on the outside. . .
. . .and juicy on the inside.
Why are we standing here?
We're waiting for you to open
you said, ''Got the keys. ''
No, I didn't. I asked. . .
. . . ''Got the keys?''
You said, ''Got the keys! ''
Either of you have the keys?
The oven is on!
I've gotta get my ticket!
Wait! We have a copy of your key.
Then get it!
That tone won't make me go any faster.
That one will.
And everyone's telling me,
''You gotta pick a major! ''
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.
And you have no idea what I'm saying,
because, let's face it, you're a fetus.
You're just happy you don't
You can sing to it.
Please. I am not singing
to your stomach.
How's it going?
Here we come
Walking down the street
Get the funniest looks from
Everyone we meet
Hey, hey--
-Did you feel that?
-That was the first!
Keep singing! Keep singing!
Hey, hey, you're my baby
And I can 't wait to meet you
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel
And then we'll go to the zoo
I felt it that time!
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy
I'm the one without any breasts
Not that one.
Can you go any faster?
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!
You do the math.
Why do you guys have so many
do this right now. But I'm not!
I swear you said you had the keys!
I wouldn't say I had the
keys unless I had the keys!
I obviously did not have the keys!
That's it! Enough with the keys.
No one say ''keys'' !
Why would I have the keys!
Besides the fact that
-Well, you should have.
-Why?
-Because!
Because everything's
my responsibility?
Isn't it enough that I'm making
so I'm making different potatoes.
Does anybody care what kind
of potatoes I want?
Just as long as Phoebe gets
her peas and onions. . .
. . .and Mario gets his Tots.
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I--
It's all burnt, and I can't. . . .
Monica, only dogs can hear you now.
Look, the door's open!
are ruined! Potatoes are ruined!
Here we come
Walking down the--
This doesn't smell like Mom's.
It doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps.
Well, here you go, buddy.
You got one!
God, this is great!
The plane is gone, so I guess
This was nobody's first choice!
Oh, really?
So why was I busting my ass
to make this delicious dinner?
You call that delicious?
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.
What?
Ugly Naked Guy's taking
his turkey out of the oven.
Oh, my God! He's not alone.
Ugly Naked Guy. . .
. . .is having Thanksgiving
and who wants dark cheese?
I don't even want to know
about the dark cheese.
-Does anybody want to split this?
-I will.
You guys have to make a wish.
Make a wish?
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.
You got the bigger half!
propose a toast.
A little toast here. Ding, ding!
This isn't exactly the kind of
Thanksgiving you planned. . .

I think because it didn't

-Yeah. All the time.
-Really?
But, we just refer to you
as " Bobo the Sperm Guy. "
If she's talking to it, I just think
can hear everything.
-Really?
-I'll show you. This'll seem weird.
But you put your head
inside this turkey...
...and we'll all talk
behind this experiment.
In fact, I'd very much like
to butter your head.
-Hey.
-Rach, did you make your money?
No, not even close. Forget Vail.
-Thanks. You can put it on the table.
No. Here's your mail!
Thanks. You can put it on the table!
Would you just open it!
Oh, my God! You guys are great!
We all chipped in.
-We did?
-You owe me $.
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Chandler, got your traditional
holiday feast. T omato soup...
...grilled-cheese fixings
What is it with you and this holiday?
-I'm  years old.
-I hate this story!
We've finished this magnificent
Thanksgiving dinner. I have...
...a mouthful of pumpkin pie.
And then my parents tell me
dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
What's this?
I never saw this at Mom's.
-It's a yam.
-Hello....
This isn't a yam.
or anything, but back off.
Hi.
-We used to work together.
-We did?
Yeah, at Macy's.
You' re the Obsession girl, right?
-Yes.
-Yeah, right!
-You' re the best in the business.
-Get out.
You' re amazing! You know when
to spritz. You know when to lay back.
Really? You don't know
What are you wearing?
Nothing.
-Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?
-Yeah, that would be
-What's wrong?
-I have to do something.
What?
-Leave.
-Saw what?
No, we' re just laughing. You know
how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.
"T onight, on a very special Blossom. "
Looking good! Okay!
Cider's mulling, turkey's turkeying,
the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Get out and stop annoying me!
Oh, that's closer.
I got the tickets!
Five hours from now,
shoop, shoop, shoop!
-Oh, you must stop shooping.
-Okay, l' m gonna get my stuff.
Will you come in?
I prefer to keep a safe distance
the stuffing, but that's not funny.
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any T ator T ots.
-That's not a question.
-My mom makes them. It's a tradition.
You get a piece of turkey on your fork,
with my family because of my disease.
All right. Fine.
Tonight's potatoes will be mashed,
with lumps and in the form of Tots.
All right, I'm off
to talk to my unborn child.
Okay, Mom never hit.
Okay, all done.
Phoebe, did you whip the pota?
and then add some peas and onions.
Why do that?
Because then they'd be just like my
mom used to make it, before she died.
Okay. Three kinds
of potatoes coming up.
Okay. Goodbye, you guys!
Sorry! I'm so sorry.
An unbelievable thing happened!
Underdog got away!
-The balloon?
-No, no, the actual cartoon character.
Of course the balloon!
He broke free and was spotted
-I can't!
An -foot dog over the city?
How often does that happen?
Almost never.
-Got the keys?
-Okay.
Anytime you' re ready.
Okay. Okay, here we go.
Okay. Where am I talking to here?
There is one way that offers a
just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby. Hello. Hello.
the moment we first saw
the dog shadow fall over the park!
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.
Right now the turkey should
the door. You have the keys.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do. When we left,
you said, "Got the keys. "
No, I didn't. I asked, "Got the keys? "
No, no, no. You said, "Got the keys! "
Do either of you have the keys?
-The oven is on!
-I've gotta get my ticket!
-Wait! We have a copy of your key.
-That one will.
And everyone's telling me,
"You gotta pick a major. "
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.
And you have no idea what I'm saying,
because, face it, you' re a fetus.
You're happy you don't
You can sing
Please. I am not singing
to your stomach, okay?
How's it going?
Here we come
Walking down the street
Get the funniest looks from
Everyone we meet
Hey, hey
-Hey, did you just feel that?
-That was the first.
IKeep singing! IKeep singing!
Hey, hey, you 're my baby
And I can 't wait to meet you
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel
Then we 'll go to the zoo
-lt did it again!
I'm the one without any breasts
This is great. It's . My plane
is pulling away from the gate.
-Maybe you can take a later flight.
-There is none.
-You can go tomorrow.
you have to meet me halfway.
Can you go any faster?
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!
You do the math.
Why do you guys have so many
keys in there anyway?
For an emergency just like this.
All right. Listen, smirky!
If not for your stupid balloon,
now. But l' m not!
You said you had the keys!
No, I didn't! I wouldn't say I had
the keys unless I had the keys!
That's it! Enough with the keys.
No one say keys!
Why would I have the keys?!
-Aside from the fact you said you did?
-Why?
-Because!
-Why?
Everything's my responsibility?
Isn't it enough that l' m making dinner?
Everyone wants a different kind
of potatoes I want? No!
No! No!
Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas
and onions, and Mario gets his T ots
It's my first Thanksgiving, and l
It's all burnt, and I can't....
Monica, only dogs can hear you now.
Look, the door's open. Here we go.
-All right, Chandler, don't lose this.
are ruined! Potatoes are ruined!
Here we come
Walking down the
This doesn't smell like Mom's.
It doesn't, does it? You wanted lumps?
Here you go, buddy. You got one!
-Don't yell at me. You burned dinner!
-Hey, don't make her squeak again!
God, this is great! The plane is gone.
This was nobody's first choice!
Oh, really? So why was I busting
my ass to make this delicious dinner?
-You call that delicious?
-You be quiet!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Skiing.
Shoop, shoop, shoop....
Shoop.
-Eww.
out of the oven.
-Who cares?
-He just sat in gravy.
Oh, my God! He's not alone.
Ugly Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving
dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
I gotta see this!
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!
Ugly naked dancing!
It's nice that he has someone.
Shall I carve?
-By all means.
and who wants dark cheese?
I don't even want to know
about the dark cheese.
-Does anybody wanna split this?
-I will.
-You guys have to make a wish.
What did you wish for?
The bigger half.
All right, I'd like
to propose a toast.
A little toast here. Ding, ding!
This isn't the Thanksgiving
you planned...
...but for me,
divorce or projectile vomiting.
If you'd gone to Vail
or if you had been with your family...
...or if you didn't have syphilis
and stuff...
...we wouldn't be together.
I guess what l' m trying
of your Thanksgivings sucked.
-That's so sweet!
-Thank you.
-Here's to a lousy Christmas!
-And a crappy New Year!
-Hear, hear!
Guys? There's somebody
Where did you get him?
My friend Bethel rescued him
from some lab.
That is so cruel.
Why? Why would a parent
name their child Bethel?
That monkey's got a Ross on his ass!
Is he gonna live with you,
since Carol left, so. . . .
Why don't you just get a roommate?
I don't know.
You reach a certain age. . .
. . .having a roommate
is just kind of pathe--
Sorry, that's ''pathet,'' which is
GELULA & CO., INC.
I'm doing all-new material tonight.
I have  new songs about my mother's
suicide and one about a snowman.
Might want to open with the snowman.
So how'd it go?
I didn't get the job.
How could you not get it?
You were Santa last year!
I don't know. Some fat guy's
It's all political.
What are you gonna be?
I'm gonna be one of his helpers.
It's just such a slap in the face,
you know?
Hey, do you guys know
what you're doing for New Year's?
Hey, what? What is wrong
You don't have to face the pressure. . .
. . .of finding anything with lips
to kiss when the ball drops!
Man, I'm talking loud!
For your information, Paolo's
gonna be in Rome this New Year's.
I'll be just as pathetic
this Dick Clark holiday.
I say this year, no dates,
we make a pact.
Just the six of us. Dinner.
-Sure.
-Fine.
I was hoping for a little
back by popular demand. . .
. . .Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Thanks. Hi.
I want to start with a song that
means a lot to me this time of year.
I made a man with eyes of coal
And a smile so bewitchin '
How was I supposed to know
That my mom was dead in the kitchen?
My mother's ashes
Even her eyelashes
Are resting in a little yellow jar
And sometimes when it's freezing
I feel a little sneezy
And now I--
Excuse me? Excuse me?
Noisy boys.
Is it something you'd like
to discuss while I'm playing. . .
. . .I assume it's important enough
for everyone else to hear.
That guy's going home with a note.
-I was just saying--
-Could you speak up?
Sorry.
I was saying you were
he'd ever seen.
And I said I liked her in Splash,
but not in Wall Street.
-I thought she had a hard quality.
-A hard quality.
And while Daryl Hannah is beautiful
with a kind of delicate grace.
Then that's when you started yelling.
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
I think that guy's going home
with more than a note.
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
Pheebs, I can't believe
he hasn't kissed you yet.
I mean, by my sixth date with Paolo,
He's very methodical.
I think it's romantic.
Me too!
Did you ever see
An Officer and a Gentleman?
He's kind of like the guy
I went to see that with.
Except he's smarter and gentler
with him all the time.
You know, day and night.
And night and day.
And special occasions.
I see where this is going.
You're gonna ask him to New Year's.
You'll break the pact.
This was your pact!
I couldn't handle the pressure
and I snapped!
But Janice?
That was the worst breakup in history!
I'm not saying it was a good idea.
I can look in on him.
That would be great!
But make sure it seems
like you're there to see him. . .
. . .and you're not doing it
as a favor to me.
Okay. But if he asks,
test this theory.
Because today's particle accelerators
are nowhere near powerful enough. . .
. . .to simulate these conditions.
All right. I have a question then.
Were you planning on kissing me ever?
That's definitely a valid question. . .
. . .and the answer. . .
. . .would be yes.
Yes, I was.
But see, I wanted it to be
this phenomenal kiss. . .
. . .that happened at this
the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.
And now, it's just got to be
one of those things where I. . .
. . .sweep everything off the table
and throw you down on it.
And I'm not really
a ''sweeping sort of fella. ''
I mean, you're a sweeper
trapped inside a physicist's body.
-Really.
-I'm sure of it.
You should just do it.
This is just really expensive.
And this was a gift.
-Now you're just tidying up.
-Okay, what the hell?
-You want me to actually throw you--?
-I can hop.
Tell me something, what does
has somebody and Phoebe has somebody.
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Fun Bobby, your ex-boyfriend,
Fun Bobby?
You know more than one Fun Bobby?
I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Okay. Here we go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's no room for milk.
There. Now there is.
So on our no-date evening, three
-Four.
-Five.
-Five.
Sorry. Paolo's catching
an earlier flight.
And I met this really hot
there alone when the ball drops?
Come on. We'll have a big party,
and no one will know who's with who.
This is so not what I needed now.
What's the matter?
Oh, it's Marcel.
He keeps shutting me out.
He's walking around all the time,
dragging his hands.
That's weird. I had a blast
-We played. We watched TV.
That juggling thing is amazing.
What juggling thing?
With the balled-up socks?
I figured you taught him that.
It wasn't that big a deal.
Just balled-up socks.
And a melon.
-Phoebe! Hi!
We are going to Minsk.
Minsk?
Minsk. It's in Russia.
I know where Minsk is.
We got the grant!
Three years, all expenses paid.
So when do you leave?
January  st.
-What are you doing here?
-Max told me about Minsk.
So, you know, congratulations!
This is so exciting!
It'd be even more exciting,
with Lipson and Yamaguchi and Flank.
I want to stay here and make out
with my girlfriend! ''
Okay, thank you, Max.
Thank you.
So you're really not going?
I don't know. I don't know
-Please?
But I'm asking you.
I can't make a decision.
-Please, just--
-Okay. Stay.
-Stay.
-Stay.
Getting so good at that!
It was Max's stuff.
I love this artichoke thing.
Don't tell me what's in it.
you greet guests at a party?
If I showed up with my new girlfriend,
she wouldn't be welcome?
Your new girlfriend
wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
He was more embarrassed
to walk back in here. . .
. . .like nothing happened. . . .
All right. All right.
Just keep him away from me.
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.
What do you say you and I
do a little mingling?
All right. . .
. . .I'll catch up with you later.
Oh, my God! Rachel, honey. . .
. . .are you okay?
Where's Paolo?
Rome.
Jerk missed his flight.
And then your face exploded?
I was at the airport
with a pocketbook. . .
. . .starts yelling at me.
Something about how
it was her cab first.
The next thing I know, she just
starts pulling me out by my hair!
And I started blowing my attack
she tackles me!
And I hit my head on the curb
and cut my lip on my whistle.
Everybody having fun at the party?
Are people eating my dip?
When I saw you at the store
last week. . .
. . .it was probably the first time
to spend the whole evening with me. . .
. . .but at least check in.
There you are!
You got away from me.
But you found me.
Here, Ross, take our picture.
Smile. You're on Janice Camera.
Kill me. Kill me now.
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!
Hey, sorry I'm late.
But my grandfather. . .
. . .died about two hours ago.
But I couldn't get a flight
out till tomorrow, so. . .
. . .here I am.
Hey, Fun Bobby!
How's it going, man?
Whoa! Who died?
It's going to be an open casket,
I'm gonna write ''Reunited'' in glitter.
All right, Janice, that's it!
When I invited you, I didn't
think it meant that we--
Oh, no!
-I'm sorry you misunderstood.
-Oh, my God!
You listen to me!
your last chance with me!
Will you give me the thing?
Hi, Max.
Yoko.
I've decided to go to Minsk
without you.
It won't be the same. . .
. . .but it will still be Minsk.
Happy New Year.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
You're going to Minsk.
No, I'm not going to Minsk.
Oh, you are so going to Minsk.
You belong in Minsk.
You can't stay here just for me.
Yes, I can. Because if I go,
-Oh, yes. Yes, you can.
Just say, ''Phoebe, I love you,
but my work is my life.
That's what I have to do now. ''
And I say, ''Your work?
How can you say that?''
And then you say,
Can't you understand that?''
And I say, ''No!
No! I can't understand that! ''
Sorry.
And then you put
your arms around me. . . .
Put your arms around me.
Sorry.
And then you tell me you love me
and you'll never forget me.
I'll never forget you.
Then you say that it's almost
the year with me if you can't finish it.
I'm gonna miss you. . .
. . .you scientist guy.
Hi, this is Dick Clark live
in Times Square.
We're in a virtual snowstorm
of confetti here in Times Square.
It gets better every year.
Here you go, kids.
And then the peacock bit me.
Please kiss me at midnight!
You seen Sandy?
I don't know how to tell you this. . .
. . .but she's in the bedroom getting it
I did know how to tell you.
Hey, everybody, the ball is going.
What?
The ball is dropping!
In  seconds, it'll be midnight.
And the moment of joy is upon us.
Looks like that ''No-Date Pact'' thing
worked out.
Everybody looks so happy.
I hate that!
Not everybody is happy.
I'm no math whiz. . .
. . .but I do believe there are
three girls and three guys right here.
I don't feel like kissing
anyone tonight.
I can't kiss anyone.
So I'm kissing everyone?
You can't kiss Ross.
getting kissed but me.
Somebody kiss me.
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!
All right! All right! All right!
There!
I wanted this to work so much.
I'm still in there, you know?
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fleas.
But he's just phoning it in.
It's hard to accept

All right! You guys,
it's starting to snow.
And look, Ugly Naked Guy
is hanging candy canes.
Where?
Oh. Well.
That's festive.
Guys, there's somebody
-No, I don't.
-He's cute! Where'd you get him?
-My friend Bethel saved him from a lab.
That is so cruel.
Why would a parent
name their child Bethel?
That monkey's got a Ross on his ass.
Is he gonna live with you
since Carol left.
Why not get a roommate?
You reach a certain age, having
a roommate is just kind of pathet
That's " pathet. " Sanskrit for
" really cool way to live. "
The One With the Monkey
I' m doing new material tonight.
I have   songs about my mother's
-Hey, buddy.
-So how'd it go?
-I didn't get the job.
How could you not?
You were Santa last year.
Some fat guy's sleeping
It's all political.
-What are you gonna be?
-One of his helpers.
It's just such a slap in the face,
you know?
Do you know what you' re doing
What is wrong with New Year's?
You have Paolo. You don't have
to face the pressure...
...of finding lips to kiss
when the ball drops!
Man, I'm talking loud!
Paolo's gonna be in Rome
-Yeah, you wish.
I've got an idea. Dinner.
It's perfect. We'll put it between
lunch and breakfast.
I'm sick of being a victim
of this Dick Clark holiday.
I say this year, we make a pact.
-Fine.
I was hoping for more enthusiasm.
-Phoebe, you' re on.
-Oh, good.
Hi. Ladies and gentlemen,
back by popular demand...
... Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Hi. Thanks. Hi.
I wanna start with a song
Excuse me? Yeah, noisy boys.
Is it something you'd like
to share with the group?
No. No, that's okay.
If it's important enough
while I'm playing...
...it's important enough
-Speak up.
Sorry, l
I was saying you were the most
beautiful woman I'd ever seen.
And he said that Daryl Hannah...
...was the most beautiful woman
he'd ever seen.
I said I liked her in Splash,
in a conventional way...
...you are luminous
with a kind of delicate grace.
Then that's when you started yelling.
We're gonna take a short break.
That guy's going home
with more than a note.
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
I can't believe he hasn't
he'd already named both my breasts.
Did I just share too much?
Just a smidge.
David's, like, a scientist guy.
He's very methodical.
-I think it's romantic.
-Me too!
Did you ever see
I went to see that with.
Except he's smarter and gentler
and sweeter.
I just wanna be with him all the time.
You know, day and night.
And night and day.
And special occasions.
I see. You're gonna ask him
-No! No, no.
No. Yeah, could I just?
-Yeah. I already asked Janice.
-What?
This was a pact! This was your pact!
I couldn't handle the pressure.
I snapped!
But that was the worst breakup
I snapped!
Hi, sorry I'm late.
Too many jokes.
Must mock Joey.
Nice shoes, huh?
God, you're killing me!
Ross, he's playing
with my spatulas again!
-He's not gonna hurt them, right?
-Do you always have to bring him?
I didn't wanna leave him alone.
I said some things that I didn't mean.
He threw some feces.
If you're working late,
I can look in on him.
That would be great!
But make sure it seems
like you're there to see him.
You're not doing it for me.
Okay. But if he asks,
test this theory.
T oday's particle accelerators
aren't powerful enough...
-...to simulate these conditions.
-I have a question then.
-Yeah?
and the answer...
...would be yes. Yes, I was.
But I wanted it to be
this phenomenal kiss...
...at a phenomenal moment
because it's you.
Sure.
The longer I waited, the more
one of those things where l...
...sweep everything off the table.
And I'm not really
a sweeping sort of fella.
David, I think you are
a sweeping sort of fella.
I mean, you're a sweeper
-I'm sure.
You should just do it. Just throw me.
-Now?
-Yeah, right now. Just....
Okay. Okay. Okay.
You know what?
This is really expensive.
And this was a gift.
-Now you' re just tidying up.
-I can hop.
T ell me something, what does
" no-date pact" mean to you?
It's just that Chandler
and Phoebe have somebody.
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
-Your ex-boyfriend?
-I happen to know a Fun Bob.
-Okay. Here we go.
-There's no room for milk.
There. Now there is.
So on our no-date evening,
three of you now have dates.
-Four.
an earlier flight.
And I met this really hot
single mom at the store.
What's an elf to do?
So I'll be the only one alone
when the ball drops?
We'll have a big party,
what I needed right now.
-What's the matter?
-Oh, it's Marcel.
He's angry with me. I have
no idea why. He keeps shutting me out.
He's walking around all the time,
I had a blast with him.
-Really?
-We played, watched TV.
That juggling thing is amazing.
What juggling thing?
With the socks?
I figured you taught him that.
No.
It wasn't that big a deal.
-Max. Do you know everybody?
No. Have you seen David?
He hasn't been around.
If you see him, tell him to pack.
We are going to Minsk.
-Minsk?
-Minsk. It's in Russia.
I know where Minsk is.
We got the grant.
that's the way to go.
-So when do you leave?
-January  st.
-Hello?
-What? Hey. Hi.
-What are you doing here?
if we were going.
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?
T ell her. " I don't wanna go...
...to work with Lipson,
Yamaguchi and Flank.
I wanna stay and make out
with my girlfriend! "
Okay, thank you, Max. Thank you.
So you're really not going?
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I just found you.
Oh, David. But what are you gonna do?
I don't know. You decide.
-Don't do that.
-But l' m asking you.
-I can't make a decision. Just
-Okay. Stay.
-Stay.
The diet starts tomorrow.
You remember Janice.
Vividly.
-How are you?
-I am fantastic.
Now.
It's amazing. We've been back
together for what...
-...Iike   minutes, and
Forgive and forget.
Well, forget.
-Hi.
-Hi, l' m Sandy.
Sandy, hi. Come on in.
-You brought your kids.
-Yeah. That's okay, right?
-Party!
she wouldn't be welcome?
Your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate
on my coffee table.
He was more embarrassed
about that than anyone.
And for him to have the courage
Just keep him away from me.
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.
What do you say you and I mingle?
All right, I'll catch up
with you later.
Oh, my gosh!
Rachel, honey, are you okay?
-Where's Paolo?
getting into a cab...
...when this woman, this blond
planet with a pocketbook...
...starts yelling. Something
about how it was her cab first.
The next thing, she just
whistle thingy...
...and three more cabs show up.
So as I'm going to get into a cab,
she tackles me!
And I hit my head on the curb
and cut my lip on my whistle.
Everybody having fun at the party?
-Are people eating my dip?
-You went a bit wide on the lipstick.
-Oh, I did?
-Yeah.
It's hard for me to tell.
My eye's closing up.
Let me get it for you.
-Ow!
screw the psycho cab lady.
It's New Year's Eve.
Let's have a good time.
-Okay, here we go.
-Okay.
All right, there you go. This way.
Here you go.
When I saw you at the store
I ever mentally undressed an elf.
-Wow, that's dirty.
-Yeah.
Hey, kids.
He doesn't have to spend
the whole evening with me...
... but at least check in.
There you are!

I don't want to know.
-No problem.
Susan.
Who should we call first?
Your folks or Deb and Rhona?
Never mind.
I don 't wanna know.
So just because it was my table,
There's no rule.
If anything, you owe me a table.
How did you get that?
This piece of furniture
was fine. . .
. . .until your breakfast adventure
with Angela Delveccio.
You knew about that?
The impressions you made in the butter
like, buy it together?
Do you think we're ready for that?
Why not?
It's a big commitment.
What if one of us wants to move out?
-Are you moving out?
-I'm not moving out.
You'd tell me if you were?
-It's just, with my last roommate--
then he ran off and got married. . .
. . .and things got ugly.
Let me ask you something.
Was Kip a better roommate than me?
Don't do that.
You've got a couple changes

Well, Rachella's right.
I don't know what you said,
so let's start.
I am. . .

That's your decision.
Some people prefer to take off--
Being naked!
I can't believe you don't want to know.
and Carol knows, and Susan knows--
And Monica knows.
How could you?
I don't even know.
Carol called to thank me
for the lasagna.
I asked. She told me.
So what's it going to be?
Great! Now he knows
about being an aunt.
Or an uncle.
Fine!
What's the matter?
Nothing! I'm sorry.
I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
Can we get some
cappuccino over here?
Oh, right! That's me!
That table place closes at . Come on.

What is it?
You know Paolo?
I'm familiar with his work.
He made a move on me.
-The store'll be open tomorrow.

Was it. . .?
Boy Scouts could've

-The actress!
-Uma Thurman!
Thanks, Rach.
-What'll you do?
moral obligation as a friend. . .
. . .as a woman.
It's a feminist issue.
Guys? Guys?
You have to tell her.
Feminist issue?
That's where I went.
She is gonna hate me!
Will you pick one?
''Uh-oh, I'm outside again. ''
Fine.
What about the birds?
I don't know.
Birds just don't say. . .
. . . ''Hello, sit here. Eat something. ''
You pick one.
How about the ladybugs?
So forget about the birds, but
big red insects suggest fine dining?
Fine! Do you want the birds?
of my suitcases.
This one's Paolo's.
Rachel, can we talk for a sec?
Sure.
Just for a sec, because Paolo's
on his way over.
We haven't known each other
for that long a time.
There are three things
important thing in my life.
Two, I never lie.
And three, I make the best
oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Thanks, Pheebs.
My God!
Why have I never tasted these before?
I don't make them a lot, because
it's not fair to the other cookies.
You're right. These are
I've ever seen.
I know.
So will you balance the plates
on these little heads?
Who cares?
We'll eat at the sink.
Come on!
Heads up, Ross.
Score!
You suck!
Are you okay?
I need some milk.
I've got milk.
Here you go.
Better?
I feel so stupid!
I think about the other day
''Oh, Paolo! He's so great!
He makes me feel so--''
God!
I'm so embarrassed!
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm the one he hit on.
Phoebe, I pushed him on you.
If I had never met him,
this would never--
-I'm so sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.
Wait!
-What are we sorry about?
-Oh, God, he's such a pig!
He's like a big disgusting pig. . . .
-Pig man!
-Yes, good!
But he was my pig man!
How did I not see this?
Oh, I know!
Because. . .
. . .he's gorgeous.
And he's charming.
And the way he looks at you--
The end.
God!
Should I not have told you?
Trust me, it's much better
that I know.
But I just liked it better before.
and see if she's okay.
Just one second.
Score!
Game! Us!
Come on.
It looks like
we kicked your butts.
She kicked our butts.
You could be on the Olympic
''Standing There'' team.
Come on. Two on one.
Why are you still here?
you gotta be the first guy she sees.
She's got to know
you're everything he's not.
You're like the anti-Paolo.
My Catholic friend is right.
She's distraught.
You're there for her.
You pick up the pieces, and then
-Don't stare.
She finished throwing
his clothes off the balcony.
Now there's just
gesturing and arm-waving.
That is either, ''How could you?''
for what you did to Rachel.
But I still have five of these. . .
. . .so heat it at 
untiI the cheese bubbles.
I just wanna tell you. . .
. . .and I think I'd speak
for everyone when I say. . . .
Just look at her.
Guys, I think only one of us
-Right.
And I really think it should be me.
You all right?
I've been better.
Come here.
Listen. . .
. . .you deserve
so much better than him.
I mean, you. . .
. . .you should be with a guy who knows
what he has when he has you.
What?
I'm so sick of guys!
I don't want to look
about another guy.
I don't even want
to be near another guy.
Ross, you're so great.
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?
Medium.
Any cookies left?
See, Rach. . .
. . .I don't think swearing off guys
sophisticated screening process.
I just need to be
by myself for a while.
I just gotta
figure out what I want.
See, because not all guys out there
not gonna grow up to be one.
What?
What?
I'm having a boy?
No. In fact,
you're not having a boy.
I'm having a boy.
Am I having a boy?
You're having a boy!
I'm having a boy!

Will you balance plates

If I had never met him

-No, l' m sorry.
-l' m sorry.
-I don't know.
Right. He's the pig.
-Such a pig!
-Oh, God, he's such a pig!
He's like a big disgusting pig....
-Pig man!
-Yes, good!
But he was my pig man!
How did I not see this?
Oh, I know!
Because...
... he's gorgeous.
And he's charming.
-And when he looks
that I know.
But I just liked it better before.
It was better.
She took it pretty well.
Paolo's over there now, so....
We should go and see if she's okay.
-Game! Nice!
Come on, Pheebs.
Well, it looks like we
kicked your butts.
She did. You could be on the Olympic
"Standing There" team.
Come on. Two on one.
Why are you here?
-Yes. Now is when you swoop.
When Paolo walks out,
you gotta be the first guy she sees.

-Right.
And I really think it should be me.
You all right?
I've been better.
I don't believe this.
I wasn't supposed to care
about this guy.
It was just supposed to be
"That was a big, fun, ltalian thing. "
It wasn't supposed to feel
like this when it was over.
Come here.
Listen...
...you deserve
so much better than him.
I mean, you...
...should be with a guy who knows
or think about another guy.
I don't even want
to be near another guy.
Ross, you' re so great.
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?

Anybody else?
Did I miss something?
No, she's still upset
because I saw her boobies.
What were you doing
a telescope and a box of doughnuts.
Can we change the subject, please?
Because, hello? These aren't her

How did you know?
It's textbook.
Hey, you guys.
You all know my dad, right?
-How long are you in the city?
-Two days.
I got a job midtown.
I'm better off
on the ferry.
I don't know this one.
This is my friend Roger.

She's a pet mortician.
Sure.
So how long have you been. . . .
Remember when you were a kid, we'd

that she was a lesbian?
I don't know.
Maybe you wanted
Why?
I don't know.
Maybe low self-esteem?
Maybe to compensate
for overshadowing a sibling.
Wait!
you sabotaged your marriage. . .
. . .so the sibling would be less
of a failure in the parents' eyes.
That's ridiculous!
I don't feel guilty for her failures.
-So you think I'm a failure?
sucking up to Mom and Dad. . .
. . .so they'd favor you.
I married a lesbian
to make you look good!

Occasionally you get a person
who wants them in a pose.
Like chasing their tail.
Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.
Joey, if I go first, I want to be
at my place.
I thought you'd need it
for your meeting.
Thank you.
So! Who's up for a big
game of Kerplunk?
Look, I. . . .
I shouldn't have come.
I gotta go.
that thing this late.
Where am I gonna stay?
Here?
We'll go to a hotel.
We'll go to a hotel.
-No, you won't.
-No, we won't.
If you go to a hotel,
where I can keep an eye on you.
You're gonna keep an eye on us?
Right, mister!
I don't care how old you are,
while you're here. . .
. . .you're gonna live by my rules.
And that means no sleeping
with your girlfriend.
Wow, he's strict.
Dad, you'll be in my room.
Ronni, you can stay in
You're a good kid.
Come on.
I'll show you to my room.
That sounds weird when it's not
followed by, ''No, thanks, it's late! ''
This is just for tonight.
-What kind of change?
-Break up with Ronni--
-I can't!
Then come clean with Ma!
This is not right!
I don't wanna hear it!

or tall, like pancakes?
You know what I mean.
the right one comes along. . .
. . .I'll be able to be a standup guy
and go the distance.
Now I'm looking at my Dad thinking--
You're not him, you're you.
When they wanted you to go into
your father's business, did you cave?
You chose
when the right woman comes along. . .
. . .you'll have the guts to say
''No thanks, I'm married. ''
You really think so?
I really do.
-Thanks, Chandler.
-Get off!
May I help you?
Joey said I could use your shower
since Chandler's in ours.
Who are you?
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.
The mistress?
-Come on in.
Bathroom's up there.
Say, Ronni. . . .

How's it going?
Good.
Roger's having a dinner thing
and he wanted me to invite you guys.
What's going on?
Nothing.
It's just that. . . .
It's Roger.
There's something about--
Basically, we just feel
he's so perceptive. . .
. . .that it freaked you out?
-No, I hate him!
-No, we hate him!
I'm sorry.
Ma! What are you doing here?
I came to give you this. . .
. . .and this!
Big ring!
Why did you fill your father's head
with that garbage. . .

Things were fine the way they were!
There's chicken in there.
Really.

Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.

I know you did.
So tell me. . . .
Did you see her?
You're ten times prettier
than she is.
That's sweet.
Could I take her?
With this ring, no contest!
-What's wrong, sweetie?
It's my friends.
They have a liking problem with you. . .
. . .in that. . .
. . .they don't.
They don't?
But you know. . .
. . .they don't see all
of the wonderfulness that I see.
They don't see all the good stuff
and all the sweet stuff.
They think you're a little. . . .
What?
Intense and creepy.
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
I'm not at all surprised
That's why you're so great.
Actually, it's
quite typical behavior. . .
. . .when you have this kind
of dysfunctional group dynamic.
You know, this kind of codependent. . .
. . .emotionally stunted. . .
. . .sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
have nipples on them.
And you're all like,
''Oh, define me! Define me!
Love me! I need love! ''
So you talked to your dad?
He's gonna keep cheating on Ma,
like she wanted.
Ma's gonna keep pretending
can't see her husband anymore. . .
. . .because he got
a restraining order.
Which has nothing to do with it,
except that I found out today.
Things have changed here
You know, they're parents.
After a certain point,
you gotta let go.
Even if you know better. . .
. . .you gotta let them make
their own mistakes.
And just think. . .
. . .in a few years,
I'll either be an alcoholic blond. . .
. . .chasing after -year-old boys. . .
. . .or I'll end up like my mom!
How's it going?
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.
Yeah, right!
What happened?
I don't know. I mean. . . .
He's a good person. . .
. . .and he can be really sweet.
And in some ways,
I think he is so right for me.
It's just. . . .
I hate that guy!
What's going on?
Clear the tracks for the boobie
payback express.
Next stop, Rachel Greene.
Joey, what the hell were you doing?
Sorry, wrong boobies!
Hello, Joey!
Hello, dear!
<font color="#ffff" size=>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
-That is it!
You barge in here
and you don't knock?
You have no respect for privacy.
No, you wait!
-Can I just say one thing?
I can still see...
...your nippular areas.
The One With The Boobies
Honey, tell them the story
about your patient...
...who thinks things are
other things.
When the phone rings
-Thanks. Okay.
Now go away so we can
talk about you.
Okay. I'll miss you.
-lsn't he great?
-He's cute. He likes you so much.
I know. He's so sweet.
he's not too shrinky.
Think you'll do it on his couch?
I don't know. That's a little weird.
It's vinyl.
Okay, you guys want anything else?
-Could I have?
-We're all out. Anybody else?
Did I miss something?
No, she's still upset
because I saw her boobies.
What were you doing
across the street with a telescope.
Can we change the subject, please?
These aren't her "boobies."
These are her breasts.
Pheebs, I was hoping
for more of a change.
I always liked "Bazoombas."
Gives them a Latin spin.
Can we drop this already, please?
Why are you embarrassed?
I mean, mittens are "nice."
Okay. Rock, hard place. Me.
You're so funny!
He's really funny.
I wouldn't wanna be there
when the laughter stops.
Whoa, back up there, sparky.
What did you mean by that?
It seems that maybe
you have intimacy issues...
...that you use your humor
I don't know you from Adam.
Only child, right?
Parents divorced
before you hit puberty.
-How did you know that?
-It's textbook.
Hey, you guys.
-Two days. I got a job.
I'm better off staying with Joey...
...than going back and forth
on the ferry.
-I don't know this one.
-This is my friend Roger.
-Good to meet you.
-Dad.
Oh, excuse me.
So, Ross, how's the wife?
 for , huh?
Chandler, say something funny.
I gotta go. Miss you too.
-I love you, but it's getting late
-Say hi. Hey, Ma.
I made the appointment
I'd take you to the navy yard?
-Since then?
-No, it's only been six years.
I wanted you to think of a nice memory
so you'd know I'm not a terrible guy.
-What are you doing?
I chop garlic. It's a wacky world.
Joe, you ever been in love?
-I don't know.
-Then you haven't.
-You're burning tomatoes.
-You're one to talk.
Your dad's in love. The worst part is,
one of them is Ma.
Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?
It's like if you woke up
and found out...
...your dad leads this double life.
He's like actually some spy
That would involve sex.
I'd like to think that our parents
don't do that.
I know. Why can't parents
just stay parents?
Why do they have to become people?
at my breasts?
What?
What?
Didn't you get a good enough look?
We're all adults here.
There's only one way to resolve this.
Since you saw her boobies you have
to show her your pee-pee.
You know,
-And Rog!
Come on up.
Oh, good! Rog is here.
-What's the matter with Rog?
-It's a little thing. I hate that guy!
So he was a little analytical.
That's what he does.
Come on, he's not that bad.
You're wrong! Why would I marry her...
...if I thought that she was
your marriage to fail.
Why? Why would l? Why?
I don't know. Maybe low self-esteem?
Maybe to compensate
for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe
Wait! Go back to that "sibling" thing.
Well, I don't know.
You could've sabotaged
your marriage...
...so the sibling would feel like
I don't feel guilty for her failures.
-You think I'm a failure?
-lsn't he good?
Yeah. No, that's not
what I was saying.
I thought you were on my side.
But maybe you sucked up
to make you look good!
You're right. I mean, you're right.
It wasn't just the Weebles,
but the Weeble Play Palace...
...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship...
...with this lifeboat
for the Weebles to wobble in.
And Mom just gave them all away.
That's tough, tough stuff.
Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie,
-We're gonna be late, sweetie.
-Thanks for everything, Mon.
-No problem.
Listen, it was great seeing you again.
Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?
Remember, they're just food,
they're not love.
I hate that guy!
Good night, you guys.
Oh, look. It's the woman we ordered.
Hey, can we help you?
No, thanks. I'm just waiting
your pictures.
I'm Ronni.
Cheese Nip?
Joey's having an embolism,
but I'd go for a nip.
Most people,
when their pets pass on...
...want them like they're sleeping.
Occasionally you get a person
I wanna be looking for my keys.
-That's a good one!
-Hey.
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.
-Hi.
-Hey.
Hello, babe! What are you doing here?
Oh, you left your hair at my place.
I thought you'd need it tomorrow.
Thank you.
So, who's up for a big
-Where do I stay? Here?
We'll go to a hotel.
We'll go to a hotel.
-No, you won't.
-No, we won't.
If you go to a hotel,
you'll be doing stuff.
I want you here so I can
-Right.
As long as you are under my roof...
...you're gonna live by my rules.
That means no sleeping
with your girlfriend.
Wow, he's strict.
Dad, you'll be in my room.
You can stay in Chandler's room.
And Chandler will be?
Out here with me, bunking up.
Oh, bunking up. If you smell s'mores,
"No, it's late."
This is just for tonight.
Tomorrow you gotta change.
Change?
-Break up with Ronni
-I can't!
Then come clean with Ma!
Now go to my room!
Hey, kickie!
-What are you doing?
-Getting comfortable.
-I can't sleep in my underwear.
-Well, you're gonna.
I was thinking about how I'm always
or tall, like pancakes?
You know, how I date all these women.
I always figured, when the right one
comes along...
... I'll be able to go the distance.
Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking
You're not him, you're you.
When they wanted you in
your father's business, did you cave?
-No.
the out-of-work-actor business.
That wasn't easy, but you did it.
I believe when the right woman
comes along...
...you'll have the guts to say,
"No, thanks, I'm married."
-You really think so?
-Get off!
-Hi.
-Hi. May I help you?
Joey said I could use your shower
since Chandler's in ours.
Okay. Who are you?
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.
The mistress?
-Come on in.
been in the shower?
Oh, like five minutes.
Perfect.
Fasten your seat belts,
it's pee-pee time.
-Hey, Mr. Trib.
-Hey, good morning, dear.
Chandler Bing,
-I thought it was Chandler!
You were supposed to be in there
so I'd see your thing!
Sorry, my thing was in there with me.
-How's it going?
-Good.
Roger's having a dinner thing.
-Nothing.
It's just....
It's Roger, you know?
There's something about
We just feel that he's....
-We hate that guy!
-We hate him!
-We're sorry, Pheebs.
-Okay.
Don't you think it's just that
-I came to give you this and this!
Big ring!
Why'd you fill your father's head
with garbage...
...about making things right?
Things were fine this way!
There's chicken in there. Put it away.
For God's sake, Joey! Really.
-Hold on. You knew?
-Of course I knew. What do you think?
Your father is no James Bond.
You should've heard his stories.
"I'm sleeping over
-So then, how could you?
Do you remember
how your father used to be?
Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.
Not that wood shop, not those
He has a hobby.
Ma, I don't mean
to be disrespectful...
... but what the hell
are you talking about?
-I mean, what about you?
would look like Sting.
And something else
Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along...
... he's so ashamed of himself
that he's been more attentive.
He's been more loving. It's like
-Well, don't be!
Now everything's screwed up.
I just want it the way it was.
Ma, I'm sorry.
I just did what
I thought you'd want.
I know you did, cookie.
I know you did.
So tell me. Did you see her?
Yeah.
-You're  times prettier than she is.
-I'm sorry.
I have a thing,
which means you can't ever do that!
-What's wrong, sweetie?
-Nothing.
-No, what's wrong? Come on.
It's just It's my friends.
They have a liking problem with you...
...in that they don't.
They don't?
But they don't see all
the wonderfulness that I see.
They don't see all the good
and sweet stuff.
-They think you're a little
-But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
-I'm not at all surprised about that.
-That's why you're so great.
It's quite typical behavior...
...when you have this kind
of dysfunctional group dynamic.
You know, this kind of codependent,
with your stupid big cups...
...which might as well
have nipples on them.
And you're all like,
"Oh, define me! Define me!
Love me! I need love!
You talked to your dad?
He's gonna keep cheating on Ma
she doesn't know.
And my sister, Tina,
can't see her husband.
He got a restraining order.
Which has nothing to do with it.
I found out today.
Things have changed here
-Yeah, I guess.
It's just You know, they're parents.
After a certain point,
you gotta let go.
You gotta let them
make their own mistakes.
And think, in a few years,
an alcoholic blond chasing men...
...or I'll end up like my mom!
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs.
How's it going?
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.
-Yeah, right.
-No, no, really.
-What happened?
and he can be really sweet.
In some ways,
I think he is so right for me.
It's just.... I hate that guy!
Hi, Joey. What's going on?
Clear the tracks
for the boobie payback.
Next stop, Rachel Greene.
Joey, what the hell were you doing?
Sorry, wrong boobies!
Hello, Joey!
Hello, dear!

She lent me an egg once.
You're in!
Oh, right.
Come on. You gotta get back
your ex-wife's a lesbian, you. . . .
I don't think we need a third.
Excuse me. Could we get an egg
still in the shell?
An egg?
Go up to her and say, ''Here's your
egg back. I'm returning your egg. ''
I think it's winning!
I think it's insane.
She'll love it!
-Thank you.
-It's suicide. The man's got an egg.

-You cannot do this.
-What? Do what?
Roger wants to take her out.
No! Pheebs! Don't you remember
a date on Valentine's Day!
You can go out with a creep
any night of the year.
I know I do.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Actually, tomorrow night
depends on how tonight goes.
-Listen, about tonight--
I'm bringing a friend for her friend.
But her friend sounds like such a--
Pathetic mess. I know, but. . . .
Come on, man, she's needy,
she's vulnerable.
I'm thinking. . . .
Thanks.
You haven't been out with a woman
since Janice. You're doing this.
She said yes.
Way to go, man!
Still got the egg, huh?
How do I look?
I don't care.
There's Lorraine.
Now, remember, no trading.
You get the pretty one.

I'm going out the window!
No, don't, please! I've been waiting
-Calm down? Calm down?
You set me up with a woman I've dumped
twice in the last five months!
Can you stop yelling?
You're making me nervous. . .

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.
Come on! Do it, do it, do it!

-Which one was he?
-Pete the Weeper?
Remember the guy that used to cry
every time we had sex?
''Oh, was it good for you?''
Well, I'd take a little crying
two months. I didn't get to win once!
How do we end up with these jerks?
We're good people.
I don't know. I think we're like
some kind of magnets.
I know I am. That's why I can't

So we can do it
It's perfect.
Okay, well, what kind of ritual?
Okay, we can burn the stuff
they gave us.
Or. . .?
Or we can chant and dance
around naked, you know, with sticks.
Burning's good.
I've got stuff to burn.

Oh, my God!
Janice! Hi!
Janice is gonna go away now!
I'll be right back.
Joey! Look who it is!
Oh, good! Joey's home now!
This is so much fun!

. . .he doesn't just lose three hours,
-Nope. That's it.
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.
I always forget that part.
Hello!
Okay. So now we need sage branches
and the sacramental wine.
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.
That's okay!
All right. Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.
If we had that, we wouldn't be doing
from my dinner with--
-A picture of Scotty Jared, naked!
-Let me see!
He's wearing a sweater.
Okay, and here we have
the last of Paolo's grappa.
Wait! Isn't it almost pure--
How can I dump this woman
You dumped her on New Year's.
Oh, man! In my next life
I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Hello, funny valentine!
Hi, just Janice.
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.
I could just kiss you all over
and I'm gonna!
If you don't do it, I will.
So what do you do for a living?
Well, for the past few years,
shoot the spot without you.
I thought they could!
--working with children,
which is really fulfilling.
I'll try to get back
as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
So I'm spending most
that wasn't even my major.
Now, that is funny!
Hey, do you think--
Would it be too weird if I invited
Carol over to join us?
Because she's alone now.
And pregnant. And sad.
-I guess.
-Are you sure?
Thanks. Carol!
Wanna come over and join us?
Oh, no. I'm fine.
Come on, stand up. These people
You guys will scooch, won't you?
Let's try scooching! Come on!
-Come on.
-Thank you.
Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willet.
Carol, Kristen.
How do you do?
Carol teaches sixth grade.
And Kristen. . . .
Kristen does something. . .
. . .that, funnily enough. . .

What do we got there?
A piece of silk boxer shorts. . .

. . .what looks like a
half-charred picture of. . . .
Wow! That guy's hairier
how this happened.
It's all right. Don't explain.
It's not the first boyfriend bonfire
to get out of control.
-You're our third call tonight.
-Really?
Sure. Valentine's is our
to tell you this.
At least, no new way
for me to tell you this.
I just don't think things
are gonna work out.
That's fine.
It is?
Because I know that this
won't let that happen.
Don't you know it yet?
You love me, Chandler Bing!
Oh, no, I don't.
Then why do you think
we keep ending up together?
New Year's, who invited who?
Valentine's, who asked who
into whose bed?
I did, but--
You seek me out!
Something deep in your soul
your mother a wolverine.
You did so. I swear.
I swear to--
How long has she been in the bathroom?
I don't think she's in the bathroom.
Her coat is gone.
Well, maybe it's cold in there.
Maybe I screwed up the first date
-Oh, God.
You know, this is still pretty hot.
Mushroom.
Smile.
They won't all be like this.
Some might even stay through dinner.
-I'm sorry. That's not funny.
-No, it's just. . . .
Well, you know the whole
with this cute woman. . .
. . .and she's perfectly nice,
you know?
But there's. . . .
That's it.
And then I'm here talking to you,
and it's easy and it's fun.
And I don't have to. . . .
-I know.
another shot.
I know what you're gonna say.
You're a lesbian.
But what do you say we just
put that aside for now, you know?
Let's just stick a pin in it, okay?
Because we're great together,
but there's something right here.
I love you.
I love you too.
-But--
-No ''but. '' No ''but. ''
You know that thing they
put over here with the pin in it?
It's time to take the pin out.
You'll find someone, I know you will.
You found one already.
All you need is a woman who likes men
and you'll be set.
Not her.
We get off around midnight.
Why don't we pick you up then?
So will you bring the truck?
I'll even let you ring the bell.
-We'll see you later.
-You're right!
They're nice guys!
They're firemen guys!
-You tell them you're married?
-No way!
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I'm not gonna tell them!
<font color="#ffff" size=>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
-She lent me an egg.
-You're in!
-Right.
Hey, Ross.
Come on. Get back in the game.
The Rachel thing isn't happening,
your ex-wife's a lesbian....
I don't think we need a third.
Could we get an egg,
"I'm returning your egg."
I think it's winning.
-It's insane.
-She'll love it.
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Here.
Go with the egg, my friend.
Go, go, go!
-Think it'll work?
-Do what?
-Roger wants to take her out.
-No! Remember why you dumped him?
Because he was creepy.
And mean. And frightening.
Still, it's nice to have
a date on Valentine's Day!
You can go out with a creep any night.
I know I do.
-What are you doing tomorrow night?
-Don't you bail on me!
I said I'd bring a friend
for her friend.
-But her friend sounds like a
-Pathetic mess. I know, but....
Come on. She's needy, vulnerable.
I'm thinking....
Thanks.
You haven't been out with a woman
-Way to go, man!
Still got the egg, huh?
How do I look?
I don't care.
There's Lorraine.
No trading. You get the pretty one,
I get the mess.
Hi, Joey.
Well, well!
Look what you brought!
Very nice.
And what did you bring?
She's checking her coat.
I'm gonna wash the cab smell
and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?
Janice!?
Oh...
... my...
...God!
Hey, it's Janice!
Okay, I'm making a break for it!
I've been waiting for, like, forever
to go out with Lorraine.
-Just calm down.
-Calm down?
You set me up with a woman I've
You're making me nervous and....
I can't go when I'm nervous.
I'm sorry, you're right.
Come on! Do it, do it!
Roger was creepy, but he was nothing
compared to Pete.
-Who?
-Pete the Weeper.
The guy that used to cry
over Howard, the "I win" guy!
"I win! I win!"
We went out for two months.
I didn't win once.
How do we end up with these jerks?
We're some kind of magnets.
I know I am. That's why I can't
wear a digital watch.
There's more beer, right?
You know my friend who shaves her head?
No.
I have this friend
bad boyfriend cycle...
...you can do a cleansing ritual.
Pheebs, this woman
is voluntarily bald.
Yeah.
We can do it tomorrow night.
It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.
Okay, what kind of ritual?
We can burn the stuff they gave us.
Or...?
Or we can chant and dance
Good for you.
Quarters or rolls of quarters?
By the way, I cut you out of
all of my pictures.
So if you want, I have a bag
with just your heads.
That's okay.
You could make little puppets
Theater of Cruelty!
-We can't do that!
-What? What can't you do?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Over there?
We might be leaving now.
Tell me it's you and me "we."
She wants to slather my body
to be a part of it!
Okay, you cannot do this to me.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Can we have three
chocolate mousses to go?
I'm out of here.
Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me.
I hope she throws up on you.
Thanks.
-So....
sticking out of your zipper.
Excuse me.
How you doing?
So do we have the best friends,
or what?
Joey's not a friend.
He's...
...a stupid man who left us
A big-screen TV?
-I'll have a drink.
-Got it. Good woman!
-A bottle of overpriced champagne.
-Each.
That's right, each.
-No, no!
And yet it did.
-Goodbye, Janice.
-kiss me!
Oh, Chandler. Sorry.
Oh, Chandler. Sorry!
-Hey, Janice.
-Hi, Monica.
Well, this was very special.
Rach, come see who's out here!
What's going on? Oh, my God!
Janice! Hi!
Janice is gonna go away now!
I'll be right back.
Joey! Look who it is!
Good. Joey's home.

How can I dump this woman

I don't know.
I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

Hi, just Janice.
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.
I could just kiss you all over,

If you don't do it, I will.
-So are you actually from New York?

Mini-pads should be that much easier.

I'll try to get back

I'm spending most of my time

Now, that is funny!
Do you think it would be too weird
if I invited Carol over to join us?
Because she's alone now.
And pregnant. And sad.
-I guess.
-No, I'm fine.
Come on.
These people will scooch down.
You guys will scooch, won't you?
Let's try scooching! Come on!
-Come on.
Carol, Kristen.
-How do you do?
-Carol teaches sixth grade.
And Kristen....
IKristen does something...
...that, funnily enough...
...wasn't even her major!
-Thanks for coming over.
-Not at all. It's pretty much our job.
That's why we get the cool hats.
-What do we got there?

I had them made special.
Okay, Janice.
Hey, Janice.

But what do you say we just

Let's just stick a pin in it.

You can't deny it.
I've got a ring at home
with both of us in them.
And best of all,
you're carrying my baby.
-I mean, how perfect is that?
-Ross
You keep saying that, but there's
-No "but."
You know that thing we

It's time to take the pin out.
You'll find someone.
The right woman is waiting for you.
It's easy for you to say.
and you'll be set.
Not her.
So, you guys really slide down a pole?
-Absolutely.
-That's so cool.
How do you get back up?
Well, we rarely have to return
from a fire as quickly.
So, would you guys....
Would you like to, sometime, maybe....
Go for a drink sometime?
Sure, sounds good.
We get off at midnight.

Hi, there.

and I thought of you first.
But Chandler's the one

Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
What kind of food

He wants to do something eclectic,

-Is this the bug lady?
I love you, Ross.
Her name's Celia.
She's not a bug lady.
She's curator of insects

What are you gonna do?
I thought we'd go to dinner,

It's creamier.

I'm just happy I'm keeping it down.
God, what happened to you?

I asked a waitress at work
to help me out.
Waitressing?
Of course I thought of you.

But, you see, it's just this thing

A weird thing happened to me
on the train this morning--
Talk dirty.
-Here?
-Vulva.
''Vulva?''
All right, I panicked, all right?
She took me by surprise.
But it wasn't a total loss.
I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Whoa, you cuddled? How many times?
Shut up. It was nice.
I just don't think I'm
the dirty-talking kind of guy.
Just say what you want to do to her.
Or what you want her to do to you.
Or what you think other people
Try something on me.
Please be kidding.
Why not? Come on.
Just close your eyes and tell me
what you'd like to be doing right now.
I'm in my apartment. . . .
Yeah, what else?
You're not there.
We're not having this conversation!
-All right. I'll start.
All right, ready?
Oh, Ross. . .
. . .you get me so hot,
I want your lips on me now.
See?
Now you say something.
I really don't think so.
Come on.
You like this woman?
-You wanna see her again?
-Sure.
If you can't talk dirty to me,
to caress my butt!
Okay, turn around.
I don't want you staring at me
while I do this.
All right, all right.
I'm not looking. Go ahead.
Okay.
I want--
Okay, I want. . .
. . .to feel. . .
. . .your hot, soft skin
-You're not gonna believe this.
It's okay. It's okay.
I was always rooting for you
two kids to get together.
While you were sleeping, that guy
from your old job called again.
Again?
-And again and again and again.
How's life on the  th floor?
Yeah, I miss you too.
It's a lot less satisfying
to steal pens from your own home.
That's very generous.
But look, this isn't about the money.
I need something more than a job.
I need something I really care about--
That's on top of the year-end
-Your dream!
Look, Al. Al, I'm not
playing hardball here, okay?
This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection!
Stop saying numbers!

Okay. That's enough of the view.
Check this out.
Okay, sit down here. Sit down.

You ready?
Helen, could you come in here
for a moment?
Thank you, that'll be all.
Last time I do that.
-Nope.
$   an hour.
I wish I could, but I've made plans
to walk around.
When you ran out on your wedding,
I was there for you.
I put a roof over your head,
May I take your coat?
-Hi, Steve.
-Hello, Monica.
Hello, greeter girl.
-This is Rachel.
-Yeah, okay.
Everything smells so delicious.
I can't remember a time I smelled
but all right.
What's up?
In the cab on the way over,
Steve blazed up a doobie.
What?
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja.
Okay, I'm with you, Cheech.
Is it dry in here?
Let me get you some wine.
I think we're ready
we'll serve some tartlets.
''Tartlets?''
''Tartlets. ''
''Tartlets. ''

Excuse me. Can I help you
with anything?
You know, I don't know
what I'm looking for.
Oh, cool! Taco shells!
These are-- They are like a little

Macaroni and cheese!
We gotta make this!
No, we don't.
Sorry.
Why don't you just have a seat here?
Give me the Gummy Bears.
Give them to me.
We'll share.
-No. Give me the bears.
-You can't have any.
Give them to me!
This is not working.
Bears overboard! They're drowning!
Hey, fellas! Grab onto a Sugar-O!
-''What?''
-Why?
-''Why?''
I've waited seven years
for an opportunity like this. . .
. . .and you can't even wait
for a guy like that.
I know. It's just I just thought
that this was, you know, ''it. ''
You'll get there.
You're an amazing chef.
You know those yummy noises?
of dirty talk.
It was the most elaborate filth
you have ever heard.
I mean, there were characters,
plot lines. . .
. . .themes, a motif.
At one point, there were villagers.
And. . . .
Well, by the time we finished
both exhausted, so. . . .
-You cuddled.
-Yeah, which was nice.
Do you guys want to try to catch
a late movie?
Shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
Whoa! Where the hell is he?
Yes, Fran, I know what time it is. . .
. . .but I'm looking at the WENUS
Let me tell you something.
You will care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!
How's this?
Sorry. How about over here?
That just means it's working.
Does this hurt?

Someone was supposed to write,

...and put it on the refrigera
-How long has that been there?
-Riff's.
I think Ursula likes me.
I ordered coffee.
She brought me a tuna melt
and four plates of curly fries.
Score.
She is so hot!
Before you do anything Joey-like,
-Yeah.
Is it okay
if I asked out your sister?
Why? Why would you want
to do that? Why?
So if we went out on a date,
you know, whatever.
And I mean, it's true,
we were one egg once.
But you know,
we've grown apart so....
I don't know. Why not?
Cool. Thanks.
-You okay?
Laverne y Shirley?
Sorry.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Where's Carol?
Stuck at school.
Some parent-teacher thing.
You can go.
We should both know what's going on.
Oh, good. This will be fun.
We're gonna start with some basic
third-stage breathing exercises.
Moms, get on your back.
And coaches, you should
be supporting Mommy's head.
-What?
-I'll play my sperm card once more.
I have to miss the coaching training
because I'm a woman?
-So, what do we do?
-I'll flip you for it.
Flip me for it? No, no.

We haven't seen an ANUS
this bad since the 's.
-What does this mean?
-We'll be laying off people.
I know I was late last week.
That's why my name's on the door.
Do you know when I'm getting
my name on the door?
I don't know.
I put it in the thing.
It's okay.
I called you in here today was....
Please don't hate me.
What?
Would you like
to have dinner sometime?
So, what do you want
for your birthday?
What I want is for my mom
Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?
-Bath salts would be nice!
-Okay! Good.
What is this place?
You're cold, I have to pee and
there's coffee. How bad could it be?
I think we have an answer.
Why is she here?
This could be God's way
-No, we were there last night.
Are you gonna go to the...?
-I'll wait till we order. It's her.
-lt looks like her.
-Excuse me?
-Yeah.
Hi, it's us!
Right. And it's me!
-So you're here too?
-That's good.
-Two caffe lattes.
-And some biscotti.
Good choice.
-It's definitely her.
-Yeah.
I can't believe you haven't told
the Christmas lights.
Congratulations! You've found
the world's thinnest argument.
I'm finding the right moment.
That shouldn't be so hard
now that you're dating.
"Honey, you're fired. But how
you don't have to knock anymore.
I'll get it.
-Hi, Mr. Heckles.
-You're doing it again.
We're not doing anything.
We're sitting and talking quietly.
I can hear you through the ceiling.
My cats can't sleep.
-You don't even have cats.
-We'll try to keep it down.
Phoebe, do me a favor. Try this on.
I want to make sure it fits.
My first birthday present!
This is really
No, no, it's for Ursula.
-Yep, lce Capades.
This is serious. I've never known you
to pay for any kind of "capade."
I don't know. I like her.
She's different.
There's something about her
That you like.
You said it was okay.
Maybe now it's not okay.
Okay. Maybe now I'm not okay
with it not being okay.
Okay!
IKnit, good woman, knit!
And that's the Chrysler Building
right there.
-Nina!
Didn't I memo you on this?
After I let her go, I got a call
from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flennan
Dr. Flennan
Dr. Flynn.
And he informed me that
the word "frenzy."
-You're kidding! She seems so
-No. Nina? She's
If you asked her now...
...she'd have no recollection
of being fired at all.
-That's unbelievable.
until she'll be no threat to anyone.
I guess you never know what's
going on inside a person's head.
Well, I guess that's why
they call it psychology, sir.
The sound Mom and Dad
is the miracle of birth.
Lights, please.
And that's having a baby.
Next week is our final class.
Susan, go deep.
-It's just impossible.
-What is, honey?
What that woman did.
I am not doing that.
It'll just stay in.
-Carol, honey, it'll be all right.
-What do you know?
No one's asking you, "Mind if we push
this pot roast through your nostril?"
Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
I know it's frightening.
parents for the rest of our lives.
I mean, that's what this is
all about, right? Ross?
Ross?
I'm gonna be a father.
-This is news to you?
-I knew I was having a baby.
I just never realized
-How can you say that?
I can't even get Marcel
to stop eating the bathmat.
-How will I raise a kid?
-Some scientists are now saying...
...that monkeys and babies
-Out.
With...?
Yes.
Can I just ask you one question?
Have you two, you know,
like, you know?
You know, yet?
Not that it's any of your business,
but no, we haven't.
You meant sex, right?
-Do you have a sec?
avoiding me and giving me weird looks.
Well, maybe that's because
they're jealous of us.
Maybe. But that doesn't explain
why they keep taking my scissors.
Maybe that's because
-Sure. Why not?
Oh, my God! You're amazing!
You don't know.
Helen, do the paperwork
on Miss Bookbinder's raise.
You still want me to send her
psychological profile to Personnel?
Helen drinks.
Will you marry me?
So after the proposal,
in control up until then.
-I told her everything.
-How'd she take it?
Pretty well.
Except for the stapler thing.
A tip. If you're ever
on the desk.
Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Can we turn it off? Make them
go away because I can't watch.
Okay, they're gone.
Are you all right?
It's just this whole
stupid Ursula thing.
Pheebs, can I ask? So he's going out
Thermos under the bus.
And then when I was  ,
she broke my collarbone.
She didn't mean to do it
but I think it still counts.
And then there's Randy Brown,
who was your best friend?
That's what he was for me.
And she kind of stole him away
and then broke his heart.
Then he wouldn't talk to me anymore.
He didn't want to be around anything
that looked like either one of us.
I know Joey's not my boyfriend
-You gotta talk to Joey.
-lf he knew how you felt
-But he's falling in love with her.
They've been going out a week.
They haven't even slept together yet.
That's not serious.
Okay. Okay.
May we help you?
What are you doing?
help me, please?
This is just the kind of thing
I was talking about.
My friend was taking down
Christmas lights...
...and may have broken her ankle.
My God, you still have
-Here you go.
All right. Name, address.
-Are you currently on any medication?
-No.
Oh, wait! Yes. Blistex.
-No. In case of emergency, call...?
-You.
-Really?
Definitely gonna want some of that!
-You don't have insurance?
-How much will this cost?
X-rays alone could be $!
-What are we gonna do?
-There's not much we can do.
Unless I use yours.
-No, no, no.
as my emergency person?
That's insurance fraud.
All right then, forget it.
Might as well just go home.
-Okay, come here. I hate this.
-Thank you. I love you.
Hi. I'm gonna need
-I am really an idiot.
I was filling out her form...
...and instead of putting
her information I put mine.
You are an idiot.
Yep, that's me. I am that stupid.
I had a dream. I was playing
football with my kid.
-That's nice.
and they hike me the baby.
I've gotta do something. The Tampa Bay
defense is coming right at me!
-Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
-Right, but...
...it is just me and the baby,
-He should take the sack?
Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield.
And I realize I'm the one
who's supposed to catch him.
I know I'm not gonna
get there in time.
So I am running and running.
to be a father.
You're gonna be fine.
You're one of the most caring,
responsible men in North America.
You're gonna make a great dad.
Yeah, you and the baby
just need better blocking.
Have you ever been to
It's her birthday.
-What about Phoebe's birthday?
-When's that?
-Tonight.
-What are the odds of that happening?
You take your time.
There it is!
-What'll you do?
Wouldn't you?
If you tried that on my birthday...
...you'd be staring at
the end of a hissy fit.
Saffron makes all the difference.
-Okay. Monica?
-Yes.
-Yes, she is.
-And I'm Dr. Rosen.
I'm okay here.
Actually, that's all right.
You can take your break.
No, this is why I became a doctor.
Ankles and stuff like that.
-Aren't you too cute to be a doctor?
Young to be a doctor. Good, Rach.
-Thank you.
-Right.
He said it was just a sprain.
-You left out the stupid part.
-It's not stupid.
The cute doctors asked us out
They work for the hospital.
It's like returning
to the scene of the crime.
-I say we blow off the dates.
-What? They are cute.
They are doctors. Cute doctors.
we learned so far?
Oh, God. Okay.
Surprise!
What are you doing?
You scared the crap out of me!
-Was that the cake?
-Yeah. I got a lemon schmoosh.
Come on. She'll be here any minute.
Hope it's okay.
"Happy Birthday Peehee."
Maybe we can make a "B" out of a rose.
We'll just use
-We just
Surprise!
This is so great! Oh, my God!
This was not at all scary.
Look! "Happy Birthday Peehee."
What a strange new nickname.
I like it! Oh, my God!
Hi, everybody. Hi, Betty! Betty, hi!
You found Betty!
Where's Joey?
Did you see Betty?
I wouldn't mind having a piece
of this sun-dried tomato business.
Five years ago, if somebody had said,
"A tomato that's like a prune"...
... I'd have said, "Get out!"
Dad, before I was born,
if someone had come to me
Dad, I'm talking about
the whole baby thing.
Did you ever get this sort of...
... panicky, "Oh, my God,
I'm gonna be a father" thing?
No. We just had kids back then.
We didn't think about it.
I was busy with the business.
I wasn't around that much.
Is that what this is about?
No, I was just wondering.
We can make up for that.
We can do stuff together.
You always wanted to go to Colonial
You know, I just....
I just needed to know...
...when did you start
to feel like a father?
Well, I guess it must've been
the day after you were born.
We were in the hospital room,
and gave you to me.
You were this ugly little red thing.
All of a sudden you grabbed
my finger with your fist...
...and you squeezed it so tight.
And that's when I knew.
So you don't wanna go
to Williamsburg?
We can go to Williamsburg.
Eat your fish.
-Rachel, the cute doctors are here!
-Hi, Jeffrey.
We brought wine.
Look. It's from the cellars
of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.
-How could we resist?
-That's great!
-Monica, how's the ankle?
After all, it is your ankle.
It's feeling a lot better.
Thank you.
Why don't you guys sit down,
and we'll get you some glasses?
Okay. Stat!
Why don't we just tell them
-Would you stop being such a wuss?
A wuss? Excuse me
for living in the real world.
-So?
-So they still seem normal.
Because they are.
When we go out with women
There are no pagan altars.
No piles of bones in the corners.
We're not going to do it.
Sometimes you can be such a baby!
-I am not a baby.
-You know what?
Every day you are becoming more
and more like your mother. Excuse me.
Here we go.
Great place.
How long have you lived here?
I've been here about six years.
And Rachel moved in a few months ago.
See, I was supposed to get married,
-Yeah.
Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish,
but hey, that's me!
-Try the hummus.
-Monica, what do you do?
I am a chef at a restaurant uptown.
-Good for you.
around, which I just love to do.
-This hummus is great.
-God bless the chickpea.
Oh, God! I am so spoiled!
That's it.
I shoplift.
You had no idea that lipstick
was in your pocket.
Did I tell you that I think
in high school I was a cow?
I used to wet my bed.
I use my breasts
to get people's attention.
We both do that!
Monica and Rachel's apartment.
Just one second.
Rachel, it's your dad.
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me.
Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now.
But there's something....
There's something
-Remember back in freshman year?
Well, Billy Dreskin
and I had sex on your bed.
Daddy.
Why? Why would I sleep
with Billy Dreskin?
His father tried to put you
She's drunk again.
I don't think "scrunchy" is a word.
Why not, if "crunchy" is a word?
Then I'm using that same argument
for "fligament."
-Ross, he's got the remote again.
-Good.
Maybe he can switch it back.
Maybe not.
Okay, Daddy? That's the other line.
Okay, no, not even in my bedroom.
Okay. Okay. Bye-bye.
Hello?
Hold on a second. Let me check
There's a problem.
-What do we do?
-Just find out what they want.
Okay. No, you do it.
Hello. This is Monica. Yeah?
Oh, okay. Yes, we'll be right down.
Thank you.
We forgot to sign one
not worth it. Let me just change.
-"Garge"?
-Nautical term.
-Cheating man.
-Okay.
-She still didn't call?
when people aren't there for you?
-What is that?
-"Tushy."
-Did you try calling her?
-For two days.
At the restaurant
-And how were they?
No, we haven't had them yet.
We're still hoping to have them.
Okay.
-You got a minute?
-Yeah, I'm just working.
So.
-I got you a birthday present.
-Like the kind you
Right. Oh, I got
something for you too.
-How'd you know I was coming?
-Yeah, twin thing.
I can't believe you did this.
I can't believe you did this.
So, what's the deal with you and Joey?
Oh, right. He is so great.
-Who?
Joey. You know,
he's really nutsy about you.
-He is? Why?
-You got me.
Right. Excuse me, doesn't this
-No. Joey.
Oh! No, he is so smart.
He'll figure it out.
Do you want some chicken?
No. No food with a face.
-You have not changed.
-Yeah, you too.
Thanks. Excuse me? My side salad?
Service here is horrible.
a signature on the form?
Well, it turns out we need a new one.
Because, you see,
I put the wrong name again.
-Because
-You're that stupid!
I am. I'm that stupid.
And I'm gonna pay
that bright either.
Mon, I'm sorry. I don't think
you're like your mother.
That's all right. And I don't
think you were selfish.
Oh, and I'm sorry I said
Say you never feel like a father.
Say your son never feels
connected to you as one.
Say all of his relationships
are affected by this.
-Do you have a point?
-All right.
-Whose turn?
-Yours. I got  points for "kidney."
No, you got zero points for "idney."
I had a "K." Where's my "K"?
You've got to help me!
My monkey swallowed a "K"!
-Get that animal out!
-Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Excuse me.
This hospital is for people!
He is people! He has a name, okay?
He watches Jeopardy!, he touches
himself when nobody's watching.
Please, have a heart.
-I'll take a look at him.
-Rachel.
-What?
-Monica.
Urs, what are you doing here?
I've been trying to call you.
Listen....
Don't say "listen."
-I don't get it. What happened?
What about what
you said under the bridge?
Yeah. You should just forget about
what I said under the bridge.
I was talking crazy that night.
-That's right, I don't.
-But I was drunk on you.
-Oh, Urs
But it's not gonna work.
Why? Is it because
I'm friends with Phoebe?
Would you stop hanging out with her?
No, I couldn't do that.
Then yeah, it's because of Phoebe.
So, you know, it's either her or me.
Then I'm sorry.
You know, you're gonna be
because we're breaking up or what.
-But you've never looked so beautiful.
-Really?
-Pheebs?
-Yeah.
He looks so tiny.
-We just heard.
to spell out "monkey."
The doctor says he'll be fine.
He's just sleeping now.
-So, you feel like a dad yet?
-No. Why?
Come on, you came through.
-Look. He's waking up.
Hey, fella. How you doing?

There's the waitress.
Excuse me!
-Hello, miss?
What are you doing here?
I was over there. . .
. . .then you said, ''Excuse me, miss. ''
So now I'm here.

GELULA & CO., INC.
I don't know if he's testing me
or just acting out. . .
. . .but my monkey is out of control!
He keeps erasing
the messages on my machine.
Supposedly by accident.
Yeah, I've done that.
And three days in a row, he got
exactly like her sister.
I'm saying I see a difference.
They're twins.
I don't care.
Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot.
You know that thing
when we talk about things?
Let's not do that anymore.

This could be a really long game.
Your sister, Ursula.
Oh, really?
She works at that place. . . .
Riff's. Yeah, I know.
You do? She said you guys
haven't talked in years.
So is she fat?
Not from where I was standing.
Where were you standing?
Pheebs, so you guys
just don't get along?
It's mostly just dumb
as the pretty one.
She was the first to walk. . .
. . .even though I did it
later that same day.
To my parents, by then it was,
''Yeah, what else is new?''
I'm sorry. I've gotta go.
but I'll catch you in gym?
Is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Susan will be there too.
We've got dads, we've got lesbians.

It might have been at first. . .

with the situation.
That's my jacket.
I know.
We're the Rostens.
I'm J.C. and he's Michael.
And we're having a boy and a girl.
Good for you!

Like buddies.
Like lovers.
You know how close women can get.

-Absolutely.
So, twins!
That's like two birds.

Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
Okay, send her in.
-Come on in.
-You wanted to see me?
I was just going over your data.

You give Rossy the remote--
-Great.
-Relax. I'll fix it.
Oh, cool.
Urkel. . .
. . .in Spanish is Urkel.
How did he do this?
Is leaving the Christmas lights up. . .
. . .your plan to keep us
merry all year long?
Someone was supposed to take
and put it on the refrigera--
How long has that been there?
Where you been?
Riff's. I think Ursula likes me.
All I ordered was coffee.
She brought me a tuna melt
and four plates of curly fries.
Score.
She is so hot!
Okay, before you do
if I asked out your sister?
Why? Why would you
want to do that? Why?
So that if we went out on a date,
she'd be there.
Well, I mean, I'm not
we were one egg once.
But, you know,
we've grown apart, so. . . .
I don't know. Why not?
Cool. Thanks.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Do you wanna watch
Laverne y Shirley?
Sorry.
Sorry I'm late.
Some parent-teacher thing.
You can go.
I'll get the information.
No, I think I should stay.
We should both know what's going on.
Oh, good.
This will be fun.
We're gonna start with some basic
supporting Mommy's head.
-What?
-What?
I'm supposed to be the mommy?
Okay, I'm gonna play
my sperm card one more time.
I have to miss out on the coaching
-Flip me for it?
Heads, heads, heads!
On your back, Mom!
All right, Mommies, take
a nice, deep, cleansing breath.

Nina. . . .
Nina.
Are you okay?
Yes. Yes, I am.
Listen, the reason that
I called you in here today was. . . .
Please don't hate me.
What?
Would you like
to have dinner sometime?
So, what do you want
to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Let me put it this way.
Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?
Bath salts would be nice!
Good.
What is this place?
You're cold, I have to pee,
and there's coffee.
How bad could it be?
I think we have an answer.
What's she doing here?
This could be God's way
-No, we were there last night.
She kept bringing swordfish.
Are you gonna go. . .?
I'll wait until we order.
It's her, right?
It looks like her.
Excuse me?
Hi, it's us!
Right. And it's me!
So you're here too?
As much as you are.
Your turn.
We know what we want.
That's good.
-Two caffe lattes.
she doesn't have a job?
You still haven't taken down
the Christmas lights.
Congratulations! I think you found
the world's thinnest argument.
Trying to find the right moment.
That shouldn't be so hard,
about a quickie before I go to work?''
Once you're inside,
you don't have to knock anymore.
I'll get it.
Hi, Mr. Heckles.
You're doing it again.
We're not doing anything.
We're just sitting around
talking quietly.
I can hear you through the ceiling.
My cats can't sleep.
You don't even have cats.
I could have cats.
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.
We'll try to keep it down.
Phoebe, can you do me a favor?
Try this on to make sure it fits.
My first birthday present!
I just figured, you know, size-wise.
Sure. Yeah.
Okay, it fits.
Are you seeing her again?
Yep, Ice Capades.
This is serious.
I've never known you to pay money
for any kind of ''capade. ''
I don't know. I like her.
She's different.
There's something about her--
That you like.

And that's the Chrysler Building
from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen. . .
. . .Dr. Flanan, Dr. Flan.
And he informed me that
she took the news rather badly.
In fact, he mentioned
the word ''frenzy. ''
She seems so. . . .
Oh, no, no.
of being fired at all.
That's unbelievable.
And yet believable.
So I decided not to fire her again. . .
. . .until I'm sure she will be
of no threat to herself or others.
I see. You never really know what's
going on inside a person's head.
Well, I guess that's why
will never forget.
For this, after all,
is the miracle of birth.
Lights, please.
And that's having a baby.
Next week is our final class.

No one's saying to you,
''Hi, is that your nostril?
Mind if we push

You meant sex, right?
-Do you have a sec?
people have been avoiding me. . .
. . .and giving me strange looks.
Oh, well, maybe that's because. . .
. . .they're jealous of us.
Maybe.
But that doesn't explain why
they keep taking my scissors.
Well, maybe that's because
you're getting a big raise!
-I am?
You're amazing!
Oh, you don't know.
Helen, make sure we do the paperwork
on Miss Bookbinder's raise.
You still want me to send her

Helen drinks.
Will you marry me?

I was busy with the business.
I wasn't around that much.
Is that what this is about?
No, no. I was just wondering.
There's time to make up for that.
We can do stuff together.
You always wanted to go to coIonial

Thanks, Dad, really.
You know, I just, I just. . . .
I just needed to know. . .

You were this ugly little red thing!

Sometimes you can be such a big baby!

This is a great place.
How long have you lived here?

I'm not a nice guy'' !

All right, very good.
Damn it, damn it, damn it!
Joey had two fives showing,

Yes?
Downright gutsy.
-I see, so you were lying.
-I was bluffing.
And what is bluffing?
Is it not another word for lying?
Sorry to break up this party, but I've
got to go fax resumes before work.
-We've got to settle.
-Settle what?
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.
See, King George is giving us
-Right.
It's their first time.
Let's forget about the money.
Hell, no. We'll pay!
Monica, I had another
answer all ready.
And you know what?
Could use some money.
-You're enjoying this, aren't you?
-Well, yeah, I am.
So you get your ya-yas
by taking money from your friends.
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from KEA.
You have to put them together
I play to win.
For me to win,
others have to lose.
If you're gonna play,
don't expect me to be nice.
Because once those cards are dealt....
Yeah?
I'm not a nice guy.
All right, let's eat.
Did you get that
-What was with that Black Bart speech?
"When I play poker,
I'm not a nice guy."
You're way off.
No, I don't think so,
because I think you love her!
No. I might have had feelings

You are not putting that on again.
If you press that button,
you are in very big trouble.
You believe what a jerk
Ross was being?
-Yeah, I know.
You're black!"
Please!
I'm not as bad as Ross.
I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?
That wasn't an incident.
I was gesturing and the plate
slipped out of my hand.

Let's do it. Okay?
We'll start with five-card draw.
Then we'll go into the studs and the
when somebody is dealing.
How is Nathan?
Now he thinks he's a man
in a woman's body.
Don't you mean
a woman in a man's body?
It should be so simple.
Ross, could we please listen
they're all recommending Trident?
No, the interview!
Unbelievable!
She absolutely loved me.
We talked for over two hours.
We've the same taste in clothes.
And I went to camp with her cousin.
-The job is perfect! I can do this.
-Great, tell us and we'll laugh.
Let's play poker!
Listen, we talked about it and
if you don't wanna play, it's okay.
Yes, we can play some other game.
Like Pictionary?
Very funny.
-But we'd like to try poker again.
-That's okay, I'm gonna give it a go.
So Pheebs owes $. .
Monica owes $..

Thanks for teaching us Cross-Eyed

Kind of stepped on
How much did they take?
Like  bucks.
-I'll give you that money back.
-Really?
No, I'm bluffing!
You guys haven't learned crap!
-Hand me the cards!

No, that's fine. We'll see who has
the last laugh, monkey boy.
Done with chitchat?
Ready for serious poker?
You guys, look! The one-eyed jack

Thank you.
Oh, cool!
where else would we get any?
Oh, right.
Great.
What is it?

My mother sends me the engagement
notices for inspiration.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
It's Barry and Mindy!
-Barry, who you almost--?
-Mindy, my maid of--
Let me see.
That's Mindy?
Wow! She is pretty.

Rach?
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is so stupid!
I mean, I gave Barry up, right?
I should be happy for them.
I am. I'm happy for them.
Really?
I guess it would be different
if I were with somebody.
Whoa, what. . . .
What happened to
The whole penis embargo?
I don't know.
I guess it's not about ''no guys. ''
It's about the ''right guy,''
you know?
With Barry. . .
. . .it was safe and it was easy,
but there was no heat.
With Paolo, all there was, was heat.

Someone that's your best friend. . .

I agree.

. . .wouldn't it
have happened already?
She said she's looking
for a relationship. . .
. . .with someone exactly like me.
She said that?
Well, I added
she's looking for someone.
And someone will be there tonight.
''Tonight'' tonight?
It's perfect.
It'll just be the two of us.
She spent all day
taking care of my monkey.
I can't remember the last time
I'd go pick up a bottle of wine. . .
. . .go over there
and try to woo her.
You know what you should do?
Take her back to the  s
when that phrase was last used.
If you keep this up...
... you'll be finished
that's Dr. Francis.
Now, she used to be a man.
Look. See, there's Raven.
We hate her.
We're glad she's dying.
And then--
What? Marcel!
Are you playing with Monica's shoes?
You're not supposed to--
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?
Oh, Marcel! Bad monkey!
Oh, God!
Sorry, Barry.
A little engagement gift.
I'm sure you didn't
Come on, roll him over!
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right, Marcel? Because--
Marcel?
-How could you lose him?
-I don't know!
We were watching TV,
Which one?
I don't know.
The left one!
Which ones?
Those little clunky Amish things
you think go with everything.
Why is the air in here so negative?
Rachel lost Marcel.
Oh, no! How?
-He pooped in my shoe.
-Which one?
Those cute black ones
What am I gonna do?
All right.
You're a monkey. . .
. . .you're loose in the city.
Where do you go?
It's his first time out, so he'll
do some of the touristy things.
I'll go to Cats.
Come on, you guys!
He'll be home any minute.
He'll kill me!
Search the building.
You take the first and second floor.
We'll take third and fourth.
What am I gonna do?
You stay here
and wait for Ross to kill you.
Does anybody want to trade?
What do you want?
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey.
Have you seen it?
I left a Belgian waffle out here.
Did you take it?
Why'd you leave it in the hall?
I wasn't ready for it.
The monkey, have you seen a monkey?
I saw Regis Philbin once.
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.
You owe me a waffle.
He's a black capuchin monkey
and pickles on the side.
Thanks.
How did it go today?
Oh, great!
It went great. Really great.
Is that wine?
You want some?
Oh, I would love some.
But you know what?
Let's not drink it here.
I feel crazy.
the murder capital of the Northeast. . .
. . .I kind of wanted
to run something by you.
You know how we
were talking before. . .
. . .about relationships and stuff. . . .
-Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this!
All right, okay.
Please don't hate me.
What? What?
You know Marcel?
I kind of lost him.
I can't believe this.
All I asked you to do was
keep him in the apartment!
I know. I'm sorry.
I guess it's partially my fault.
I shouldn't have asked you
to start off with a monkey.
I should have started you off
for him and I got--
-Who is it?
-Animal Control.
-I've even got Animal Control.
-You called Animal Control?
Why? Do you not like them?
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.
I'm not allowed to have him.
If they find him,
you never ever told us that.
Because I never expected you
to invite them to the apartment!
Hi! Thanks for coming.
Somebody called about a monkey?
You know what? That was
a complete misunderstanding.
We thought we had a monkey,
-Cat!
We checked the third floor.
No one's seen Marcel.
My uncle Marcel.
Is that who the monkey's named after?
Possession of an illegal exotic
is punishable. . .
. . .by two years in prison
little creature in jail?
Remember how we talked about saying
things quietly to yourself first?
Yes, but there isn't always time.
I'm sure there's some friendly way
to reconcile this. Have a seat.
We haven't been introduced.
Lincoln High?
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.
Luisa! Oh, my God!
Monica! It's Luisa!
Luisa! From homeroom!
You have no idea who I am, do you?
Not at all.
Well, maybe that's because
you spent four years ignoring me.
Would it have been so hard to say,
''Morning, Luisa'' . . .
. . .or ''Nice overalls''?
Oh, I'm so sorry!
It's not so much you. You were fat.
Be that as it may.
Could you help us out here on that
monkey thing for old times' sake?
Go, Bobcats!
I could. But I won't.
If I find that monkey, he's mine.
Sorry.
Marcel?
Marcel?
Hi, can I help you?
We're kind of having an emergency,
and we were looking for something.
-A monkey.
back the other way?
Of course!
Oh. Then, no.
Taste this daiquiri.
Is there too much rum?
Just a second.
Hope you find your monkey.
Oh, no, wait!
We may not know
in the heating and cooling milieu.
Weren't we in the middle
of something?
But these women are very hot
and they need our help.
And they're very hot!
We can't, all right?
We're sorry.
You have no idea how sorry.

So if we could get pictures of you,
it'd help us out.
From now on, you don't get

Oh, it's okay.
It was just my left leg.
Look, Phoebe!
Oh, Marcel! Come here!
Step aside, ladies.
-What are you gonna do?
-Just a small tranquilizer.
Run, Marcel! Run, Marcel!
Damn!
Are you okay?
I think so.
Oh, gosh!
We've been all
He's just gone!
-You don't know that.
-Come on! It's cold, it's dark.
He doesn't know the Village!
And now I have a broken foot.
Oh, my--
I have no monkey and a broken foot.
Thank you very much!
I've said I'm sorry,
There, are you happy now?
Yeah, now that you kicked the sign. . .
. . .I don't miss Marcel anymore!
It's not like
I did this on purpose.
No, this is just vintage Rachel.
Things just sort of happen around you!
You're off in ''Rachel Land,''
doing your ''Rachel Thing'' . . .
. . .oblivious to people's monkeys
Forget it, okay?
What? What?
Hey, banana man!
Oh, this is so intense!
One side of my butt is totally asleep
and the other side has no idea.
Hi! Did you order some bananas?
-What about it?
-Give me my monkey back!
I don't have a monkey.
-Then what's with all the bananas?
Where is he?
What have you done to him?
That's my monkey.
That's Patty the monkey.
Are you insane?
Come here, Marcel.
Come here, Patty.
Come here, Marcel.
Come here, Patty.
Here, monkey.
Here, monkey.
Gotcha!
-Give me my monkey back!
Just the dress is mine.
You can send it back whenever.
All right, I want my monkey!
Oh, come on, Luisa.
Sorry, prom queen.
You had to be a bitch in school,
you couldn't have been fat.
In high school,
I was the prom queen. . .
. . .and the homecoming queen
important people in my life.
You can hate me if you want,
but please do not punish him.
Luisa, you have a chance
to be the bigger person here.
Take it!
Then I'll call your supervisor
in the ass with a dart!
It'll be nice
to get this off, won't it?
Or we can leave it on for now.
That's fine.
With the right pair of pumps,
so hard on you before--
No, come on. It was my fault.
I almost lost your--
But you got him back.
You were great.
We still have that bottle of wine.
Are you in the mood for. . .
. . .something grape?
-Sure, that would be good.

And I was thinking maybe
it was partially because of how we--
-Rachel?
-Barry?
I can't. I can't do it.

This is me in The Sound of Music.
You see the von Trapp kids?
Because I'm in front of them.
I thought that was an alp.
High school was not

I don't know.

Well, I went to boarding school

Any sex I had would've involved

He doesn't know the Village!
And now I have a broken foot.
I have no monkey and a broken foot!
Thank you very much!
I've said I'm sorry a million times.
What do you want me to do?
You want me to break my foot too?
I'll break it right now.
Oh, my God!
I did this on purpose.
No, this is just vintage Rachel.

Come here, Patty.
Come here, Marcel.
Come here, Patty.

Here, monkey!
Gotcha!
-Give me my monkey back!

But this isn't high school.
We're all adults here!

For the most part.
If you take this monkey, I'll lose
an important person in my life.
You can hate me if you want,
to be the bigger person here.
Take it!
No.
All right. Then I'll call
your supervisor and tell her...
...you shot my friend with a dart!
It'll be nice to get this off,
won't it?
Or we can leave it on. That's fine.

-Where are you going?
I have things to do with my life.
I have a jam-packed schedule.
And I am late for keeping up
with it, okay?
Mindy.
How are you?
Yes, I heard. Congratulations!
That is so great!
Really, oh, God--
I'm working tomorrow. . .
. . .but if you want, you can come by
I gotta call Barry.
It's me. I just--
Mindy!
Mindy!
No, I figured
that's where you'd be.
Hell is filled
with people like you.
He's back.
-Get down?
And boogie.
Thanks, but I gotta go and get
my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Relax. She may not even know.
I haven't heard from her
in seven months, and now she calls me.
I mean, what else is it about?
She was my best friend, you guys.
We went to camp together. . .
. . .she taught me how to kiss. . . .
Now, you know,
-I'll walk out with you.
When she taught you to kiss,
you were at camp. . .
. . .and were you wearing
any kind of little uniform or--?
That's fine, yeah.
I'm going to the bathroom.
She needs to hear me pee?
Why don't you just call her?
I can't call her. I left a message.
I have some pride.
-Do you?
-No!
Danielle, hi!
It's Chandler.
I'm fine.
Listen. . . .
I don't know if you tried to call me
She's gonna call me back.
She's on the other line,
she's gonna call me back!
-Don't you have to pee?
-That's why I'm dancing.
Mindy.
Hey, you.
Hey, you.
So what's up?
We should really be sitting for this.
Sure we should.
So. . . .
Now, I know things have
except for Laurie Schaefer. . .
. . .who I don't talk to anymore. . .
. . .because she's bitter
that she lost the weight. . .
. . .and it turns out,
she doesn't have a pretty face.
I'll just ask you this once,
-That's all!
What?
That's not all.
Oh, sure it is!
Oh, no, it isn't!
I think Barry's seeing someone
in the city.
What would make you think that?
Ever since we announced
the engagement, he's acted weird.
And then last night, he came home
he went through a weird thing too.
Oh, God!
That's what I was afraid of.
What's what you were afraid of?
When Barry was engaged to you,
he and I. . .
. . .kind of had
everyone said, ''Don't do it.
He'll do to you
what he did to Rachel. ''
And now I feel so stupid.
You are so stupid.
We are both so stupid.
What do you mean?
Smell familiar?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, no, me.
I am so sorry.
No, I am sorry.
-I turned it off.
Mother of God, I turned it off!
Just like you told her you did.
Just pointing out the irony.
I went across the street
and talked to the doorman.
I got the peeper's name.
Can I use the phone?
Can I use your phone?
The number for a Sidney Marks, please.
''Heating device. ''
Radiator.
Five letters.
''Rdtor. ''
Yeah, is Sidney there?
Oh, this is?
Sidney's a woman.
So she's a woman, so what?
Yeah, so what?
I live across the street, and I know
Hello?

I'm an idiot! I was weak!
I couldn't help myself.
Whatever I did, I only did
because I love you so much.
Which one of us
It was always Mindy.
Even when we were having sex
in that chair?
I swear, whatever I was doing,
I was always thinking of you.
Oh, please!
During that second time, you couldn't
You know, it was Barry.
Oh, right.
Honey, baby, sweetheart, look. . . .
Just give me another chance.
We'll start all over again.
We'll go back to Aruba.
What do you say?
Dr. Farber, we've got
an emergency here.
Jason Castalano's choking
I'll be right there, Bernice.
Look, please don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
Okay, and we'll be here,

See how he was sweating
when he walked out?
If I'm hogging the ball too much,
This feels great!
I'm pretty sure
I'm still gonna marry him.
What are you talking about?
Mindy, the guy is the devil!
He is Satan in a smock!
Look, I know he's not perfect.
But the truth is
at the end of the day. . .
. . .I still really wanna be. . .
. . .Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber. . .
. . .D.D.S.
Oh, God!
I hope you can find some way
my maid of honor.
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you
and eat you in Aruba.
You okay?
Really?
Ever since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding. . .
. . .I have wondered whether I made
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.
I mean, he's got the monocle,
he's got the top hat. . . .
Did you know he's gay?
I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Danielle, hi!
Everybody, this is Danielle.
turns out I had your number wrong.
And when I finally got the right one,
there was no answer.
So I thought I'd come down here
and make sure you were okay.
I'm okay.
Listen, maybe we
Or you call me, whatever.
You got it!
Bye, everybody.
There you go.
Second date!
I don't know.
You don't know?
She seems nice, but that thing about
her coming all the way here. . .
. . .just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?
<font color="#ffff" size=>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

You don't observe a dance class.

I think she means, ''You dance. . .
. . .a dance class! ''
Come on, come on, come on!
Really?

Let's not have that happen again!
She could be you.

sexual maturity.
Hey, he beat you!
She says, as time goes on, he'll
start getting aggressive and violent.
What does this mean?
I have to give him up.
I can't believe it. This sucks!
You just got him.
One day he's this little thing. . .
. . .and before you know it,
he's this Little thing. . .
. . .I can't get off my leg.
Isn't there any way you can keep him?
The vet said that
unless he's in a place. . .
. . .where he has regular access. . .
. . .to some monkey loving. . .
. . .he's just gonna get vicious.
I just gotta get him into a zoo.
-How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Our first choice would be a state zoo.
You know, Like San Diego.
Right?
But that may just be a pipe dream
because he's out-of-state.
My vet knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.
But that's two blocks from the beach.
-Did you call the cops?
Nope. We took her to lunch.
Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Are you insane?
This woman stole from you!
She stole!
She's a stealer!
After you're with this woman

Yeah, which she probably stole

Excuse me?
There's an open call for Cats.
I'm thinking we go down there,
of ourselves. What do you say?
Remember who you're dealing with here.
I'm not Like you. I can't even

That's because of
your Amish background.
You're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Right.
Till I bought a blow dryer.
that changed my Life.
Did you ever see
Dead Poet's Society?
I thought that movie was
so incredibly. . .
. . .boring!
I mean, that thing at the end
he can't be in the play?
What was that?
It's Like, ''Kid, wait a year. Leave
home, do some community theater! ''
As I walked out, I thought. . .
. . . ''Now that's two hours of my Life
that I'm never getting back! ''
And that scared me more than all

Oh, God.
We didn't get into Scranton.
That was our safety zoo.
They take, Like, dogs and cows.
I don't know who this
is harder on, me or him.
I'd say that chair's
taking the brunt of it.
Good boy!
See? How can nobody want him?
Somebody will.
You know, there already is
who slaughtered all these people!
-You'd think you wouldve known that!
-You'd think I wouldve.
Phoebe, what do you think a good
stage name for me would be?
Flame Boy!
Where exactly is your zoo?
Well, it's technically
wildlife experience.
Let me ask you some questions about--
Is it Marcel?
Does he fight with other animals?
No, no. He's very docile.
Even if he were cornered?
Well, I don't know. Why?
How is he at handling small objects?
He can hold a banana,
if that's what you mean.
What about a hammer
or an animal with horns. . .
. . .you've got to give
the Little guy something.
Otherwise, it's just cruel!
He got into San Diego!
What?
We were coming back from our walk,
and the phone was ringing. . . .
He's in!
Did you hear that, Marcel?
It's San Diego! San Diego!
You're making a mistake.

. . .and give you % of the gate.
Where have you been?
Monica and I just crashed

Are you drunk?
No!
I'm Lying.

Oh, God!
Great. You know what?
You could have called.

Nope!

Big Apple Circus today.
What are you doing? You're gonna
lose your job. This is not you!

I can't believe you're in here.
What am I gonna do without you?
Who's gonna crash
the embassy parties with me?
Who's gonna take me
in front of  other women. . .
. . .and you're worried about who will
take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Well, not worried,
you know, just wondering.
There's nothing to wonder about.
You'll go back to being who you were
-Yes, necessarily.
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's the Amish thing.
I'm not actually Amish.
Really?
Then why are you Like that?
You by the door, in or out?
In!
You in the back,
for Flight  to San Diego...
...boarding at gate A.
Okay, goodbye, Little monkey guy.

of babes in San Diego. . .
. . .but remember,
It's a monkey.
Just say what you feel.
Marcel, I'm hungry.
That was good.
Marcel, this is for you.
It's just, you know, something. . .
. . .to do on the plane.
If you don't mind, I'd Like
a moment, just me and him.
-Oh, sure. Absolutely.
-Go ahead.
Marcel, come here.
I wanted to say.
I'm really gonna miss you.
You know, I'm never gonna
forget about you.
You've been more than. . .
. . .just a pet to me.
You've been more Like a--
Would you leave my Leg alone?
Would you just stop humping me
for two seconds?
Okay, would you just take him away?

Very sweet.
-And on what they pay you
-Career.
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm doing fine.
I'm afraid this has been denied.
That's impossible.
That's all right, dear.
Look how much they spent.
You only have to pay
for the stuff you bought.
Still, it's just
such reckless spending.
When somebody steals...
...they've already thrown caution
They spent $.  on a Wonder Mop.
That's me.
You see, when I say geek, I mean
The hell with it, you bought
a $ mop, you're a geek.

She's living my life,
and she's doing it better than me.
Look at this. Look. She buys tickets
I'm afraid of the salespeople.
-She spent $ on art supplies.
-You're not an artist.
I might be if I had the supplies.
I mean, I could do all this stuff.
Only I don't.
Oh, Monica, come on.
-No.
She's got everything I want,
and she doesn't have my mother.
-How about Joey Paponi?
-No, still too ethnic.
-My agent wants a more neutral name.
Joey makes me sound like I'm this big

She says Marcel's humping

Hey, he beat you.
She says, as time goes on,

So, what does this mean?
I have to give him up.
I can't believe it. This sucks.

-No way. No way did you do this.
-Monana was very brave.
We told them we were

When they saw that we're short

They threw us out.
I was thrown out of a hotel. Me.

Then I was shunned.
I was just like you. And then, one day,
I saw a movie that changed my life.
Did you ever see

I thought that movie was

Last night, I had a dream...

Excellent dream score.
Why would you dream that?

I could. I could do it. What is it?
My secretary's gonna be out.

And I kept thinking,

Unless you wanna stay over.
I mean, I'm going to. So....

that particular one yet.
I've kind of been waiting
for the right person.
-Really?
-Yeah.
You do know I was talking
You see it in the movies.
Even when you practice it at home,
man, oh, man...
...it is nothing like that.
Listen, listen.
You told me something
that was really difficult for you.
And I figure if you can
change anything.
What does it matter how old we are?
Basically, I'm nuts about you.
I knew after the first time we kissed.
You didn't mention the Tic Tac.
I just thought

I'm a little younger than I said.
-You're not a senior?

What we did was wrong.
I just had sex with someone who
wasn't alive during the bicentennial.
I just had sex.
Ethan, focus.
-It's different.
My lie didn't make one of us
a felon in  states.
-What were you thinking?
-I was too busy falling
-Don't say it.
-Sorry.
Well, fall out of it.

I'm Joan Collins.

Andre should be there
-No. Forget it.
Why not? Was I doing

All right. Fine.
You were not the only one there.
Joey was there too.
All right.
Was there...
...anybody else there?
You sure? Nobody...
... handing out mints or anything?
No, it was just the three of us.
So was it you and Chandler...
...then you and me,
or you, me and Chandler?
-You know what?
-Ethan called again.
-You're not seeing him anymore?
-No.
Sometimes, things don't work out.
This has nothing to do with him

I'm in charge,
what a great guy you still are.
-You think I should?
-I really do.
But could we not go together?
I don't wanna be the geek

This may take some time
for him to get over it...

the guy's a jerk.
No, I am not alone.
Joey's here.
What do you mean "Joey who"?
Joey who?
-Tribbiani.
-Joey Tribbiani.
Yes. Okay. Hold on.
She wants to talk to you.
Take the phone.
Yeah, it's me.
No, we're just friends.
Yeah, I'm single.
Twenty-five.
An actor. Hello?
She's not much of a phone person.
So, what's the deal
I'd wanna know about it.
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested
in your views on fatherhood? No.
-Maybe I should just go.
-Maybe you should.
Good luck...
...and take care.
The Celtics problem is that
-Oh, it is.
-Breathe.
-Breathe.
You're gonna kill me.
-Fifteen more seconds.  ,  ,  
-Count faster.
It'll be okay. IKeep focusing on Jordy.
-Your son.
I don't have a son named Jordy.
We all agreed on Jamie.
Jamie was the name
of Susan's first girlfriend...
...so we went back to Jordy.
What do you mean, back to Jordy?
Jesse-Cody-Dillon fiasco.
Ow! Leg cramp!
-I got it.
-I got it. I'm doing it.
You get to sleep with her.
I get the cramps.
No, you don't.
That is it.
-He did.
I'm trying to get
a person out of my body here...
...and you're not making it
any easier! Now go!
-Thanks.
-Out!
Breathe. Breathe.
What is that? Something exploded.
-That's not the baby, is it?
-Her water broke. Calm down.
Water breaking?
What do you mean? What's that?
Breathe. Breathe.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
-How is this my fault?
Carol never threw me out
of a room before you.
There's a lot of things
Carol never did before me.
-Are you trying to be clever?
That's it. Get in here.
My God, you guys.
I don't believe you.
There are children
coming into the world here...
...and your fighting isn't
Just stop it!
Don't make me do this again!
I don't like my voice like this!
Who wants to hear something ironic?
Are they here yet?
Don't worry,
we're gonna find them.
And until we do,
about Paris. It sounds wonderful.
There was this great little
pastry shop right by my hotel
There you go, dear.
-You find them?
-Not in the gift shop or cafeteria....
Where are Phoebe and Joey?
There's something sinister
or parts of anyone...
...scream. And scream again.
-Help!
-Come on!
-I'm having a baby in there!
-Hello!
Okay, everyone stand back.
Ow.
All right, good thing
Harder, harder.
Push him out, push him out.
Way out.
Let's get that ball and really move.
Let's get
I was just Yeah, okay.
Push, push, push.
What are you gonna do,
The very next day
And they found their bodies
The very next
Mom, everything's going fine.
Ross is great.
He's in a whole other place.
No, he's gone.
No, you don't have to fly back.
Really.
What do you mean "This might be your
about babies yet.
-Where have you been?
-I just had a baby.
Mazel tov.
It could be one hour or three.
But relax.
She's doing great.
So tell me, are you currently
to go out with me.
Right. Yeah, I've heard that
about cute doctors.
No, really. I suppose it's because
I spend so much time, you know...
...where I do.
I try not to let work
what I do. It's, like....
Well, for instance,
what do you do?
I'm a waitress.
Aren't there times when you come home
at night and you're, like:
"If I see one more cup of coffee...."
Gotcha.
-I'm gonna check up on your friend.
-Your mom called me.
So is this her?
No, this is a loaner.
Ours is at the shop.
God, I hope she has my brains.
I'm sorry you had to do this
by yourself.
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor,
a nurse and a helper guy.
-So did you see who won the game?
-You have to do it hard or else
Damn it. Damn it.
Damn it, damn it.
This is all your fault.
This should be
the greatest day of my life.
My son is being born,
in a closet with you.
I have been waiting for this
as much as you.
No one's been waiting
for this as much as I have.
You know what's funny?
You go home with the baby.
There's Mother's Day.
There's no Lesbian Lover Day.
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
This is so great.
Do you wanna explain that?
I mean, when I was growing up,
my dad left...
...and my mother died
and my stepfather went to jail.
I barely had enough pieces
three whole parents...
...who fight over
who gets to love it the most...
...and it's not even born yet.
It's just the luckiest baby
in the whole world.
I'm sorry. You were fighting.
Where are they?
-They'll be here.
and the baby's at zero station.
You are really frightening me.
Somebody wanna help me?
Trying to rip out my heart.
That's great.
Anybody seen a nipple?
Ten centimeters.
-But they're not here yet.
-I can't tell the baby to wait.
-Oh, God.
-Okay, got the vent open.
-Hi, I'm Ben.
I'm hospital worker Ben.
It's Ben to the rescue.
Ben, you ready? Give me your foot.
On three, Ben.
That's it, Ben.
What do you see?
I see what appears to be
a dark vent.
Wait.
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent.
Pheebs, it's open.
It's open.
Wait. You forgot your legs.
-Push. Push.
I need Excuse me, can I have this?
There's too many people here.
There's about to be one more.
So if you're not an ex-husband or
lesbian life partner, out you go.
-Bye-bye.
Carol's lesbian life partner?
Out.
Here he comes.
Let me see. I've gotta see.
A head.
It's huge.
How are you doing this?
You're not helping.
You're doing great.
-Hello?
-Oh, sorry.
What do you see?
Oh, look at the little fingers.
A chest and a stomach...
...and it's a boy, definitely a boy.
Legs, knees and feet.
He's here.
He's a person.
-Look.
-What does he look like?
IKind of like my Uncle Ed,
covered in Jell-O.
Really?
You guys, he's beautiful.
Thanks, Pheebs.
No shouting, but we still need
-I like Ben.
Ben.
Ben's good. How come you never
mentioned Ben before?
We just cooked it up.
That's what we were off doing.
-Can we come in?
-Yeah, come on.
I know. I know.
Everybody, there's someone
-Hi, Ben.
Ben, this is everybody.
Susan, he looks just like you.
Thanks.
I can't believe one of us
actually has one of these.
I know.
I still am one of these.
Can l?
Okay, the head. You gotta....
I'm your Aunt Monica.

But I'll still always come back...
...Iike this.
And sometimes,
I may be away longer...
...Iike this.
But I'll still always come back...
...Iike this.
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal
third and I'll go like this:
He is so amazing.
Yeah, I know. Look at him.
Nothing.
Here's little Ben nodding off.
Look at Aunt Monica's Little boy.
-Look, he's got Ross' hair cut.
Is he just the sweetest thing?
You must just want
to kiss him all over.
That would be nice.
Pardon?
Nothing. Just a Little
extra air in my mouth.
Chan, can you help me out here?
Including the waffles last week. . .
. . .you now owe me. . .
. . .  jillion dollars.
Really, I'II pay you back this time.
Where's the money coming from?

What kind of research?
Just, you know, science.

It's a fertility study.

She's gonna be late.
So how are things going?
Is she becoming your special someone?
I don't know.
She's pretty great.
What does she think of
your Little science project?
You think I'd tell a girl I like
to have sex with me.
Crazy bitch!
I got a week left in the program,
and according to the rules. . .
. . .to get the money, I can't conduct
any personal experiments. . .
. . .if you know what I mean.
Joey, we always know what you mean.
How long did you think
Someone found a bone.
They don't want us
to have the bone.
So I'm going to try to persuade them--
It's a whole big bone thing.
Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for a week.
So if you wanna reach me, you can't.
-Oh, let me see.
Could you show it to Ben now and then
so he doesn't forget me?
Hi, Ben.
I'm your father.
I am The Head!
This barbecue's gonna be fun.

a happy birthday before I Left.
She's out having drinks with Carl.

We call ourselves
''The Three Basketeers. ''
Like ''The Three Musketeers,''
-No. Presents first, food later!
Hold on there, tiger.
How are you holding up?
Well, not so good.
She thinks we're gonna

. . .if you know what I--
And you do!
So have you ever thought about
being there for her?
What do you mean?
You know, just be there for her.
Not following you.
Think about it.
I'm guessing this is from. . . .
Well, thank you, Melanie.
This one right here is from me.

Thank you.
This one's from Joey.
It feels Like a book.

There is a Little child
inside this man.
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die!
-Who's this from?
and I saw this pin.
I told him it was just Like one
my grandmother had when I was Little.
I can't believe he remembered!
Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?
It's so pretty!
This must've cost him a fortune.
I can't believe he did this.
Remember when he

What did you say?
Crystal duck.
The ''Love'' part?
Oh, my God!
That's good.
Just keep rubbing your head.
That'll turn back time.
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable!
I know.
it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee.
I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again!
Is there a mute button
on this woman?
I think this is so great!
he mentioned asking me out. . .
. . .but nothing ever happened,
so I just. . . .
What else did he say?
Does he want to go out with me?
Given that he's desperately
a cup of coffee or something.
Ross?
AII this time?
-I've gotta talk to him.
-He's in China!
The country.
Wait, his flight doesn't leave
for  minutes.
-What about the time difference?
-I've got to try.
What'll you say to him?
I don't know.
Then maybe you shouldnt go.
Right, because if you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.
But if it's good news,
tell him now.
Maybe I'II know when I see him.
Here, look.
This is just too big.
I've just got to talk to him.
I've got--
I'II see you Later.
I Love you!
Deal with me first!
AII right.
Excuse me, pardon me.
Your boarding pass?
I don't have one.
I need to talk to my friend.
Sorry, you're not allowed on

I'm sorry.
Federal regulations!
AII right, then could you please
just give him a message for me?
This is very important.
AII right.
She'll see you when you get back.
What?
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.
There's no Rachel!
Don't give me that deep freeze!
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!
I think I blacked out there
for a minute.
It was nothing.
Well, now we gotta
Let's give you another turn.
Me, again?
Sure. Why not?
Boy! Somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!
I gotta tell you, you are nothing Like
I thought you would be.
How do you mean?
I just had you pegged as one of those
man I ever met.
I mean, you're practically a woman.
So Rach, do you want to save
this wrapping paper?
It's only a Little torn.
Are you gonna go for it with Ross,
or should I throw it out?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I thought about it
all the way back and. . . .
You know, it's Ross!
You know what I mean?
It's Ross.
-Sure!
-Sure.
I don't know. This is just
We'd be Like friends-in-law!
The best part is you already
know all about him.
It's Like starting on the  th date.
But it would be Like
starting on the  th date.
Another good point.
At the  th date, you're already
Does he not make enough money?
No, I'm just--
Maybe there's someone else.
Is there?
Is there someone else?
No, there is no one else.
Then why the hell
are you dumping my brother?
Hey, big--
Spender!
She's still asleep.
-So how'd it go?
you're great in bed?
The fact you'd even ask
shows how Little you know me.
Well, Last night
I couldnt do the thing. . .
. . .that usually makes me great.
So I had to do
Man, oh, man!
It was Like
a ticker-tape parade!
I know. My room's very close
to the parade route.
It was amazing,
I'm blind. . .
. . .but all my other senses
are heightened.
You know? It's Like,
I was able to appreciate it. . .
. . .on another level.
I didn't know you had
Birthday present?
-From who?
-From you!
I exchanged the blouse
you got me.
Well, it's the thought.
Doesn't Ross' flight get in
is not a good idea.
Why?
Because I feel Like I wouldnt
just be going out with him.
I would be going out with
all of you.
There'd be all this pressure and--
No pressure, no pressure!
Nothing has even happened yet
I promise.
Who is it?
It's me, Carl.
Come on up.
Behind my brother's back?
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.
Seven hundred bucks!
AII right, you did it!
Do we have any fruit?
Man! A hell of a two weeks.
You know what, though?
I really feel I learned something.
So you'll stick with this

environmental issues, per se. . .
. . .it's just that guy!
I can't believe you'd rather
I'm trying to have a date here.
Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Can't do it, can you?
So I'm thinking about you.
So what?
I don't get it. What do you see
in this guy anyway?
Well, he seems to be
Get a real car!
Rachel, come on.
Give us a chance.
It's too hard.
Because it'll get weird
for everyone else?
Who cares?
This is about us.
I've been in Love with you
-I know.
If we broke up, and I lost you--
Why do you think
we'll break up?
Have you been involved with someone
where you haven't broken up?
No.
But it only has to happen once.
You and I know
Are you attracted to me?
I don't know.
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.
Well start Looking!
Exactly!
And you just know
I'm gonna be the guy. . .

Just, you know, science.
Science.

Actually, a little more than that.
Thank you, God.
This will bring us so much joy.

I don't know. She's pretty great.
What does she think of
your little science project?
You think I'd tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?
Man's got a point.
The tough thing is,
According to the rules...
... I can't conduct personal
experiments, if you know what I mean.
Joey, we always know what you mean.
How long did you think
this barbecue would last?
-I'm going to China.
-For the museum. Someone found a bone.
They don't want us to have it.
I'm going to try to persuade them.
It's a whole big bone thing.
Anyway, I'll be gone for a week.
If you want to reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.

This one's from Joey.
It feels like a book, I think it's

some tough times.

-Who's this from?
-From Ross.
Oh, my God! He remembered!
-Remembered what?
-lt was months ago.
We walked by this antique store.

It's so pretty!
This must've cost him a fortune.
I can't believe it.
Remember when he
expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?
Crystal duck.
No, no, no. The "love" part?
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, no, no, no.
That's good. Just keep rubbing
your head. That'll turn back time.
This is unbelievable.
This is really, really huge.
No, it's not. It's small.
It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again.
Is there a mute button on this woman?
I think this is so great.
-No, none!
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out...
... but nothing ever happened.
What else did he say?
Does he wanna go out?
Given that he's in love with you...
... he wouldn't mind getting
I've gotta talk to him.
-He's in China!
-The country.
Is his flight gone?
He's gone!
His flight doesn't leave
for  minutes.
-What about time difference?
-I've gotta try.
What'll you say to him?

-Then you shouldn't go.
Right. If you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.
But if it's good, tell him now.
-Maybe I'll know when I see him.

I've just gotta talk to him.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Rachel, I love you!
Deal with me first!
All right.
-Ross! Excuse me, pardon me.
without a pass.
He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can l?
I'm sorry. Federal regulations!
Then could you please
just give him a message for me?
-This is very important.
I have a message for you.
Rachel loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.
What?
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.
There's no Rachel.
for a minute.
It was nothing.
Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you.
You know what?
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.
-Me, again?
a big fruit basket tomorrow!
I gotta tell you, you are nothing like
I thought you'd be.
How do you mean?
I had you pegged as a guy
who's always, "Me, me, me!"
But you, you're a giver.
You're the most generous man
-No.
A woman!
-So?
-I missed him.
-I'm so sorry.
-That's too bad.
Yeah, right.
No, I feel bad for her. I do.
I can think of somebody
-Thanks.
Yes!
Pizza coupons.
Okay. You guys want help
cleaning up this mess?
That'd be great.
So, Rach, you wanna save
this wrapping paper?
Are you gonna go for it with Ross
all the way there...
...and I thought about it all the way
back. You know, it's Ross!
You know what I mean? It's Ross.
-Sure!
-Sure.
I don't know. This is just
it'd be really great.
Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be like friends-in-law!
The best part is you already
know all about him.
You start on the  th date.
But it would be like
you're already in a very...
... "relationship-y" place.
You're committed.
What happens if it doesn't work out?
-Why isn't it working out?
-Sometimes it doesn't.
Is he not cute enough?
-Maybe there's someone else.
-ls there someone else?
-No, there is no one else.
Then why are you dumping my brother?
Hey, big Spender!
She's still asleep.
-So how'd it go?
-You know how you think you're great?
The fact you'd even ask
that usually makes me great.
So I had to do all this other stuff.
And the response I got! Man, oh, man!
It was like a ticker-tape parade!
I know. My room's very, very close
to the parade route.
It was amazing, and not just for her.
For me too!
It's like, all of a sudden
are heightened.
It's like I was able
to appreciate it...
...on another level.
-I didn't know you had another level.
-I know. Neither did l!
Is something going on with O.J.?
Hey, great skirt. Birthday present?
-From who?
in a couple hours? At gate B?
Yeah. Monica, you know, I've been
thinking about it.
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.
Why?
I feel like I wouldn't
There'd be pressure
No pressure, no pressure!
Nothing has happened,
and you're already so
I'm not "so." Okay, I was a teensy
bit weird at first...
... but I'll be good. I promise.
-Who is it?
-Behind my brother's back?
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.
-Seven hundred bucks!
-All right, you did it!
Do we have any fruit?
Man, hell of a two weeks.
You know what?
"all for her" thing?
What are you, crazy?
When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around like this?
If I see one more picture
of Ed Begley Jr...
...in that stupid electric car,
environmental issues, per se...
...it's just that guy!
I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.
Excuse me, I'm trying
to have a date here.
Fine. Just stop thinking about me.
Can't do it, can you?
I'm thinking about you. So what?
I don't get it.
Get a real car!
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Ross, it's too hard.
Why, because it'll get weird
for everyone else? This is about us.
I've been in love with you
since the ninth grade.
You're like my best friend.
where you haven't broken up?
No.
But it only has to happen once.
You and I both know we are perfect
for each other. Right?
Are you attracted to me?
I don't know.
I mean, I've never looked at you
-Exactly!
And I'm gonna be the guy...
...caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!
Right! You're right.
You know what?
I'm supposed to pick up
a friend at the airport.
I am so sorry!
If you wanna finish your drinks,
-But....
-Where are you going?
-To get Ross.
-My God, this is so exciting!
-I know.
If you want the rest of my date,
-No, he's a banker with opera tickets.
Hello!
-Where you going?
-Airport.
You can't tell him.
There's so much I haven't done.
I haven't watched Baywatch
going to the airport.
Oh, well then fly, good woman,
fly like the wind.
-I'm flying!
-Tell him I'm the one who blew it!
Yes, another successful case
Excuse me. Sorry.
Toby, for God's sake,
will you let it go?
There's no Rachel!
Hey! I got that.
-Thanks, sweetie.
-No problem.
I can't wait for you
-Can't wait!
Come on, they're gonna love you.
