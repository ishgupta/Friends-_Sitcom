Oh, my God.
Okay.
So...
...I guess we shouId
Hey, Iook, it's my good friend Ross!
-Hey, Ross.
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, you.
-Hey, you.
And he brought fIowers! Thanks, Ross.
about something.
Yeah. ActuaIIy, I kind of need
to taIk to you too.
-Joey, couId you give us a minute?
-No.
-What?
I've been practicing my magic tricks.
He puIIed a quarter out of my ear.
-Hey, where's Mom?
-She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
Aunt Liddy's coming?
That means we get $ each!
So when do I get to meet Emma
I'II take you now if you want.
-But I reaIIy want to taIk to you.
-I know. I stiII need to taIk to you.
But before you guys do that,
I need to taIk to you.
And Ross, I need to taIk to you.
-And I need to taIk to you.
what these guys are taIking about.
Isn't she beautifuI?
Look at her, my first grandchiId.
What about Ben?
WeII, of course, Ben.
I meant my first granddaughter.
God, isn't she beautifuI?
Doesn't she Iook just Iike RacheI?
I know everybody keeps saying that,
our baby wiII Iook Iike?
Oh, God. PIease. You.
But it'II have my sense of humor.
Have you thought any more
about you and RacheI?
Yeah, actuaIIy I was gonna taIk to her
when you guys came in the room.
That's so exciting! Wow.
-Sure. Okay.
You can touch yourseIf in front of us,
but you can't taIk to RacheI.
What? When have I ever
touched myseIf in front of you guys?
Oh, pIease. Just before,
instead of the TV.
That reminds me. That Mr. Hazmegian
stiII has my Game Boy.
-ChandIer, can I taIk to you for a second?
-Sure.
Dude, I just did something terribIe.
That was you? I thought it was Jack.
No, no. That was Jack.
-Because it kind of Iooked Iike I did.
Again, what?
Okay, I was down on one knee
with the ring in my hand--
As we aII are at some point
during the day.
It wasn't my ring.
RacheI thought I was proposing.
Ross had a ring?
And he was gonna propose?
-I guess.
-And you did it first?
This is gonna kiII him. You know
by the way your mouth is.
Does Ross know?
Oh, my God.
What the heII am I gonna teII him?
-Maybe you don't have to teII him.
-I Iike that. Yeah.
If you cIear things up with RacheI,
he hears about it and kicks your ass.
AII right, Iet's not get carried away.
I want a baby.
Honey, we've been over this.
I need to be facing the other way.
If we have sex again, it'II doubIe
our chances of getting pregnant.
-I think that cIoset's stiII avaiIabIe.
-DeaI!
Dad, seriousIy!
You know, you reaIIy shouId
see someone about that.
Noted.
I wanna go taIk to RacheI for a minute.
Are you gonna be okay aIone for a bit?
Are you kidding me?
-Hi.
Are you aII right?
-I think I just got engaged.
-Oh, my God! He did it?
What? Did you know
he was gonna ask me?
Are you kidding?
as the puppet master of the group.
-And you reaIIy think this is a good idea?
-I just taIked him into it.
Don't teII me I have to do you too?
-The puppet master gets tired, peopIe.
-Okay.
I don't know. It just doesn't feeI right.
Why? You two are so meant
I'II come back Iater.
Wow. Kind of a fuII house here.
I guess I'II just-- I'II come back.
There he goes. Your fiancé.
I guess so.
AIthough he does
pIay with himseIf in his sIeep.
I can't say I'm surprised.
-Dad, what are you doing?
-There are peopIe in there having sex.
It can't be me. I'm standing right here.
-Wanna peek?
I don't Iike you without Mom.
Come on.
We're not peeking?
WeII, I'm peeking.
Oh, my God!
HeIIo, sir. You know Monica.
-Hey, is it okay to come in?
-Of course.
Joey, this ring, I--
It's beautifuI. I Iove it.
Yeah. Look, Rach,
-Hi.
-Are you ready to try nursing again?
-Yeah. Hi, Emma.
Why do you think
she won't take my breast?
It's aII right.
-Okay.
Okay, sweetie, you can do it.
Just open up and put it in your mouth.
Dear Lord.
-I'm sorry, honey, what were you saying?
-Yeah, Iook, I think that--
Because, Iook! She's puIIing away again.
Do you think my nippIes
Doesn't she Iook scared?
You know, I don't reaIIy know her.
Why don't we try massaging
the breast to stimuIate the fIow?
-Okay.
-Are you kidding me?
This is so frustrating.
-Hi.
CongratuIations.
I didn't want to say anything in front
of Joey. I didn't know if he knew.
What? That we had a baby?
Now Iet's give him a IittIe credit.
AIthough he did eat a piece
and RacheI are engaged.
-What?
-Oh, it's a secret?
Goody. Yes! We haven't done
the secret thing in a Iong time.
No, RacheI and I are not engaged.
I think you are.
What are you taIking about?
-Oh, that's right. It's a secret.
Right, you are not engaged.
I misunderstood her.
Phoebe, there is no secret, okay?
I didn't propose.
Are you Iying?
Is this Iike that time you tried
and taIk to RacheI myseIf.
AII right. WeII, me too.
-WeII, shouId we wake her up?
-No. No. Come on, Iet her sIeep.
-She's so exhausted.
-And so engaged.
Oh, my God. She thinks we're engaged!
Why? Why, why wouId
an engagement ring?
You know, Ross,
doctors are supposed to be smart.
-I didn't give her that ring.
-You didn't?
-No!
-Yes.
-But you didn't give it to her?
-No.
-But you were going to propose?
-No!
I might be Iosing interest in this.
Look. Look, my mom
to propose to RacheI.
But aII I wanted to do was see...
...if she maybe, kind of wanted
to start things up again.
What beautifuI Iukewarm sentiment.
I didn't want to rush into anything.
It seemed Iike she didn't want to either.
But I don't understand
assume I was gonna propose...
...throw it on
and just start teIIing peopIe?
No, no. She said you
actuaIIy proposed to her.
WeII, I didn't! I didn't propose!
UnIess....
Did I?
I haven't sIept in  hours and....
It does sound
that my dad saw us having sex.
He didn't make it to one
of my piano recitaIs, but this he sees!
This is okay. We're aII aduIts here.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Now, Iet's put our underwear
-Of course. I'II aIways be your dad.
I just want you to know that what you
witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.
-It wasn't fun?
-Why, why, why wouId you...?
Look, I just don't want you to think...
...that we're animaIs who do it
of you two having sex at aII.
It was a simpIer time.
The truth is, Dad, we're trying.
To kiII you.
Why, why, why wouId you...?
We're trying to have a baby.
-What?
-Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.
WeII, get back in there!
I'II guard the door!
That's okay, Dad,
Aren't you ovuIating?
Daddy!
You gotta get at it, princess.
When your mother and I
were trying to conceive you...
...whenever she was ovuIating,
bam, we did it!
That's how I got my bad hip.
That's funny. This conversation's how
on the sink, and your mother was--
SeriousIy, sir, my brains,
aII over the waII.
I don't think we need to hear
the specific positions you and Mom had.
You're right.
is not the optimum position...
...for conceiving a chiId.
-AIthough it might feeI good.
-I don't feeI good right now.
But pIeasure is important,
and it heIps if the woman has an orgasm.
You up to the task, saiIor?
Oh, my God....
-Hey.
I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
Joey asked me to marry him.
-What?
-Joey proposed to me.
-Is he crazy? You just had Ross' baby!
-WeII, I said yes.
What, are you crazy?
No, it is worse than that. It is wrong.
It is bigger than mine!
I know. <iDays of our Lives,</i
thank you very much.
-You can't marry him.
-Why not?
Come on, I don't want to do this aIone,
-Yeah, I mean, whatever.
If you're worried about breaking his heart,
it's stiII broken from the Iast time.
So reaIIy, you're just taking
the aIready broken pieces...
...and breaking them into smaIIer,
you weren't proposing?
No. She had the ring on...
...she seemed so excited,
and then she took her breast out.
Joey, you have to teII her what's
going on. And what did it Iook Iike?
I didn't Iook at it.
The stupid baby's head
before Ross finds out.
Look, it's not that easy.
She said she wanted to marry me.
I don't want to hurt her.
Okay, Iook, just do it gentIy.
You're right.
You're right. I'II go teII her now
before Ross finds out, and I'II be gentIe.
I can do that. I am a gentIe person.
By the way, two peopIe screwing
-Wait. Wait. Wait.
-Joey, did you propose to her?
-No.
-Yes, you did.
-ActuaIIy, technicaIIy, I didn't.
-WeII, then, why did you give me a ring?
-No, and I did not ask her to marry me.
-Yes, you did.
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.
-No, I didn't.
Yes, you did, and don't
on one knee and he proposed.
-You were down on one knee?
-Yeah, that Iooks bad.
But I didn't propose.
-Then what did happen?
-Yeah, what did happen?
Okay, the ring feII on the fIoor,
''WiII you marry me?''
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did. Oh, my God, you didn't.
-Why didn't you teII me that before?
and then you took your breast out.
You saw her breast?
I'II teII you about it Iater. Be cooI.
Then what the heII were you doing
with an engagement ring?
It wasn't my ring! It's Ross' ring.
That's why I feIt so bad, Rach,
because he was gonna propose.
What?!
You were gonna propose to me?
No.
WeII, this is awkward.
But I was going to see if, you know,
-Dude, step up. I proposed.
No, you didn't.
That's right. There's a Iot going on here,
and I think I ate some bad fruit earIier.
AII right, so Iet me just get this cIear.
You didn't propose.
You weren't gonna propose.
So this morning,
I didn't have a boyfriend...
...and somehow I got dumped
Why don't we give this another try?
Here we go again.
I can't beIieve you toId her
I was gonna propose.
-I can't beIieve you're not gonna.
-Hey, I am not gonna rush into anything.
Yeah, dude, I totaIIy understand.
UsuaIIy after I have a baby with
-What?
She's doing it!
She's breast-feeding!
It's beautifuI.
-I'II come back for her Iater.
-Thank you.
-Wow, this feeIs weird.
I'm gonna go too.
And I'm sorry about everything.
-Honey, don't worry, it was my mistake.
-No, Rach, I shouId've toId you sooner.
It's just that....
Man, that kid is going to town!
She's perfect.
We're so Iucky.
We reaIIy are.
Look, I know it's not a proposaI,
and I don't know where you are...
...but with everything that's been
-Yeah, I know.
I've been feeIing....
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
Okay, weII, that--
Wow, okay, weII--
Then maybe at Ieast we can
you were engaged.
I'm sorry, what?
When you thought Joey proposed...
...did you say yes?
Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up
these pamphIets on how to get pregnant.
-Hey, Dad.
-Hi.
Sorry to bother you again,
l was exhausted, l was emotional.
l would have said yes to anybody.
Like that time
when you and l got married.
l'm not helping.
So you said yes to him,
and you just had our baby?
That is right. And traditionally,
wanted to maybe start things up again...
...you were engaged to my best friend?
Well--
Really?
l thought Chandler
was your best friend.
Well, Chandler's my oldest friend.
Joey's my-- No!
Hey, l'm gonna take off.
most of the signs you bought are good.
No, they ran out of ''lt's a Girl!''
But l can fix this one.
See? Huh?
So sexy.
-Honey?
-Yeah?
-Honey, why don't you lie down?
and then l gotta go to the office.
Am l producing them?
-Why are you so tired?
-l couldn't sleep last night.
l started worrying about this big
divisional meeting l have today.
The more l worried,
asleep now, l'll get six hours' sleep.
But if l fall asleep now,
l'll get five hours' sleep.''
No matter what l did,
l couldn't fall asleep.
You know what you should've done?
-Hey.
-Welcome home.
-Hi.
Phoebe did the signs.
You guys, thanks for doing this.
Look at all that stuff people sent.
Oh, my gosh. Look, there's something
every mother needs.
A giant, stuffed gorilla that takes up
You guys, l love it.
Hey, so where's Ross?
He's downstairs getting the stuff
out of the cab.
-ls he still mad at us?
-Well, you more than me.
But he can't stay too mad at me.
when he comes up.
l didn't think l should be here either.
But somebody said he'd be over it.
Hey, what do l know?
l wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
The numbers we're seeing in Chicago,
have reported disappointing yields.
Boston is down. Atlanta is down.
Houston is down.
l could go on and on.
But instead of boring you...
...l'll go straight to my -point plan.
Walter.
She's just so cute.
l just want to bite her ear off
and put it in a pita pocket.
-Okay. l put most of the stuff away.
-Oh, great. The pacifiers?
-lt's in the cupboard.
-The burping cloths?
-Linen closet.
-No, l left the diapers at the hospital.
There's some in the bag,
but l'll run out and get some more.
All right, thanks.
Could you stop at the coffeehouse
and get me a muffin?
-Sure. What kind?
lt's an important decision, not like...
...say, l don't know, deciding to marry
someone. This is about a muffin.
-Blueberry.
-Blueberry it is.
Thank you.
Wow, he's not letting this go, is he?
God, how long do you think
''We were on a break'' thing quickly.
You know what,
l can't worry about it right now.
Because l've got the cutie little baby.
l can't believe how much l love her.
l mean, l can't get enough of her.
Like, right now? l miss her.
and l can see her stretch and wiggle.
Oh, my God, have you seen her yawn?
-lt's so cute.
-l know.
When do you think
she's gonna wake up?
She told me to ring her
when she yawns.
God, look at her sleeping.
l love her so much.
-l think l'm gonna wake her up.
-Rach, no.
You know, you're never
l made her.
Come on, little girl.
Yes. Hello, Emma. Hello. Hi.
Well, l would say l told you so,
but she's kind of doing that for me.
l'm sorry. Mommy's so sorry.
-lt really does.
How long do you think
we have to stay?
Okay, if everyone's onboard,
it's settled.
Chandler?
-Chandler?
Chandler will run our office in Tulsa.
You're gonna love Oklahoma.
All right. We already tried feeding her,
changing her, burping her....
Try this one. ''Go back in time
and listen to Phoebe.''
-All right, here's something.
close to your body...
...and then swing her rapidly
from side to side.
Okay.
lt worked!
No. Just stopped to throw up
a little bit.
Mon, what am l gonna do?
lt's been hours,
-Yeah. l'm not so sure.
-Oh, my God, l'm losing my mind.
-Yeah, no kidding.
All right, this just proves no good
can come from having sex with Ross!
Hey, Gunther. Can l get a couple
-Yep.
So l guess Rachel had your baby?
-Yep. Can you believe it?
-Nope.
l can't even believe
she slept with you in the first place.
You mean, like....
Hey.
l know you're pissed at me,
l didn't even do anything wrong.
What? You didn't do anything wrong?
-l said l didn't technically.
-Okay.
Let's put aside the fact
that you ''accidentally'' ...
...picked up my grandmother's ring and
for a second?
When people do this
l don't really know what that means.
You were saying?
And l could even understand
that you couldn't tell Rachel.
But why couldn't you tell me?
You had all day to, and you didn't.
l know. l should've.
-No, come on.
-Ross, we have to get past this.
-Give me the bag.
No, l don't know what else to do.
l said l'm sorry, now....
Now you should scream at me
-You'll feel better. l'll feel better.
You know you want to,
l can see it in your eyes.
-l don't.
-A little bit.
-No.
-A little bit more.
-Give me the bag. Give me the bag.
-No, hit me. Hit me.
-Give me the bag. l'm not kidding.
-Hit me.
-No.
-l'm sorry! lt was a reflex!
-Oh, my God! This really hurts!
-l couldn't help it.
When a fist comes at your face,
you duck. Look.
What is the matter with you?
You were supposed to duck!
they can check your reflexes.
-Try feeding her again.
-l already fed her.
l know. That's why l said, ''Again!''
You guys,
we can't turn on each other, okay?
That's just what she wants.
-Hi.
let her watch <iTerms of Endearment</i.
-Can l talk to you outside?
-Just stay here.
l'm gonna check her diaper.
Pheebs, you want to come?
l'm kind of part of this.
Actually, it's a husband-and-wife
-Okay.
You know we said it would be fun
to move to Paris for a year?
And you could study French cooking,
and l could write...
...and we could picnic along the Seine,
-Okay.
You know how people say
that Tulsa...
...is the Paris of Oklahoma?
What? Who says that?
People who have never been
to Paris?
-Well, what's going on?
-Okay.
Ms. McKenna,
she kind of works above my boss.
-l think you actually met her.
-Don't care. Get back to Tulsa.
She asked me to move to Tulsa
and apparently said yes.
-Tulsa, Oklahoma?
-The Sooner State.
Whatever that is.
Chandler, l don't even want to see
''Oh, What a Beautiful Morning,''
to Oklahoma or that you're gay?
l don't think l can get out of this.
-Oh, my God!
-But you don't know...
...it could be like Paris.
You can still take a cooking class...
...at Oral Roberts University.
All right, not that this matters, but did
a Ford Focus.
-l'll get out of it.
-Thank you.
-What is wrong with Emma?
-She misunderstood.
She thought she was moving to Tulsa.
Ma'am, do you have a minute?
l kind of have some bad news.
-lt's a funny story, actually.
l kind of fell asleep
in the meeting this morning.
So when l said l'd move to Tulsa,
l didn't really know what l was saying.
You fell asleep?
But only because l was up all night
about Tulsa, and she won't go.
See me, l love Tulsa. Tulsa is heaven.
Tulsa is ltaly.
Please don't make me go there.
-Chandler, l--
-l know that you're upset...
...but l just-- l would really
Can l call you Carol?
Why would l
when your name is Elaine?
What a great picture of your son.
Strapping.
That's a picture of your daughter,
l like a girl with a strong jaw.
l'll call you from Tulsa.
Hey. So how is it?
-l broke my thumb.
-Your thumb?
That's weird.
Are you sure you're punching right?
Make a fist.
Maybe later.
Ross, l feel terrible.
You know what, you can go.
trouble with my misshapen claw?
Name?
No, l know Ross.
But what's it short for?
You know, like Rossell.
Or Rosstrophor.
Just Ross.
lt's pretty.
-Okay, date of birth?
-You know my birthday.
Sure.
May...tember?
Dinosaurs is fine.
The drawing is not.
All right, who do you want
as your emergency contact?
-Rachel, l guess.
-Okay. Relationship?
Boy, this could take a while.
-Just put roommate.
You're gonna get together, right?
l don't think that we are.
But you two are supposed
to be together.
Well, l thought so too.
But then she said she'd marry you.
Come on, Ross,
freaked out about doing it alone.
-She would have said yes to anybody.
-Yeah, that's what she said.
-So?
-So l don't want to be just anybody.
-Wow.
going down that road again with us.
lt's just much easier if we're
just friends who have a kid.
-Really?
-Yeah.
-And you're okay with that?
you should stick to it.
That's why they call them plans.
Hello?
l'm fine.
Hey, for what it's worth...
...with Rachel, l don't think
you'll ever be just ''anybody.''
Hey, there you go.
''Thanks.''
Oh, my God.
under control, so l'm just gonna go.
No? Really?
Misery really does love company?
All right.
-Try holding her a different way.
-Look, l'm doing the best l can.
-Anyone else is welcome to try.
-Here you go.
Hey. Oh, gosh.
Nothing works with this child!
God, what am l gonna do, you guys?
l can't even comfort my own baby.
-l'm the worst mother ever.
-No, you're just new at this.
You'll get better. Think about
but you figured that out.
Yeah, l don't think dressing
provocatively is going to help me here!
-God, just please take her.
-Okay, l'll take her. Come on.
Oh, boy,
Oh, baby, baby, baby.
You must be a fireball in bed!
l can't believe it. She's asleep.
l got her to go to sleep.
l have actual magical powers.
l can hear traffic and birds.
l can hear the voices in my head again.
l'm kidding.
Oh, my God!
You got her to stop crying!
Yes, l did. l'm Monica, super aunt.
-You are the official baby-crier stopper.
-Say what?
That's your new job, day or night.
She starts crying, l need you here.
-No, no, no.
-Thankfully, you don't need me at all.
So okay. Hey, super aunt?
Let's give it six to eight months.
Okay, so listen,
l'm gonna go lay down.
What?
The book says whenever
she's sleeping, l should be sleeping.
So....
Hey.
-We just got her to go to sleep.
-What?
l can't-- l can't hear.
-Hey.
-Hey. Where have you been?
-What happened to you?
-l had a little thing with Joey.
lf you think this is bad,
Please sit.
All right, you have got to get over
this Joey thing.
Okay? l never really wanted
to marry Joey, okay?
Okay.
You know what l really, really want?
What, Rach?
l wanna sleep.
l wanna eat.
and we gotta do this all over again.
-Right.
-l mean, because l got news for you.
Well, that's what l'm here for.
-You want me to get that?
-No, that's really okay.
-Monica?
And l gotta tell you, it's not my fault.
-lt's a natural instinct.
-What are you talking about?
Okay, what would you do if l did this?
[ENGLlSH]
So, what's the big news you had us
rush aII the way over here for?
It took you  minutes
to head up our office in TuIsa.
So as of Monday,
I'm being officiaIIy reIocated.
-Oh, my God!
-What? Monday?
-How Iong do you have to go for?
-WeII, do you have to go?
WeII, I kind of have to, don't I?
Because of this stupid thing.
There's nothing Iike the support
of your Ioving wife, huh?
Wait a minute.
Wait, you can't go to TuIsa.
Maybe you forgot, but we have tickets
I'II be abIe to make it.
But we were gonna go see the Jets!
You can't go. I mean, you're the gIue

This whoIe thing is gonna be okay.
They said they'd rent us a house in
-No!
-Here you go, Rach.
-Thank you, Joey.
You know what?
I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
I went through this with Ben and CaroI.
I'm gonna caII Dr. Wiener.
Every time?
You don't have to caII him
whenever you have a question, okay?
-Trust me. I know this.
-AII right. I trust you.
I can see you diaIing.
with a baby. It's just so grownup.
I know, yeah.
I feeI Iike we're aII growing up.
A person named ''Wiener.''
God, that kiIIs me.
-Look at you aII grownup.
with RacheI made me reaIize...
...that maybe I'm ready for a more
serious reIationship, you know?

In fact, I think he's dead.
Why does everything happen to me?
I promise, first thing tomorrow,

See you. Bye-bye.
Why'd I have to say Mike? I don't know
I'm heading off to TuIsa.
-Oh, yeah? How'd they take it.
-Pretty weII. Yeah.
They were brave IittIe soIdiers.
Did their best to be stoic.
Some of them even high-fived each other
to mask their pain.
It's impossibIe to find a good doctor.

Excuse me?
I know what she's taIking about.
You probabIy aIso had the piano teacher

WeII, we've gotta find
a new pediatrician.
Ross was getting sick Iast night,
-Ross said he died.
He didn't die.
I just saw his daughter Iast week.
She said he was fine.
Her, on the other hand, botched Botox.
Great. WeII then, I'm gonna

He saw a therapist?
He used to have a recurring nightmare.
It freaked him out.
Wow, what was it?
That I was going to eat him.
Mike!
Yeah?
Okay.
I can't beIieve
I'm doing this with you.
AIthough I did just end

That's good.
Get aII that boring stuff out now.
Everything is gonna be fine.
FoIIow my Iead, okay?
AII you have to do is

I mean high schooI.
You guys go way back, then.
So, what are you up to these days?
-WeII, I'm a Iawyer.
-What?
That's the kind of thing

I want to pIay piano professionaIIy.
If I don't do this now, I never wiII.
Great. I Iike that better
to introduce you to Mike.
You thought he was stiII a Iawyer.
No, that's not what I meant.
Let's get you a cocktaiI.
What are you doing?
Looking for restaurant jobs
for you in TuIsa.
That's so sweet.
-Nothing, huh?
No. SIim Pickins.
It's a barbecue joint.
They're Iooking for a cook. ActuaIIy,
''cook'' may be a bit of a stretch.
They're Iooking for somebody
I know this woman, Nancy...
...who's a restaurant biz headhunter.
She may know something.
Can I say how much I appreciate
you coming with me?
When we get to TuIsa, I am taking you
to keep kosher in TuIsa.
Hi, Nancy?
Hi, it's Monica GeIIer.
I'm good. Listen, I'm Iooking

But I'm moving to TuIsa.
So, just, if you wouId teII Javu...
...I'II take it!
My name's RacheI Greene.
I have an appointment for Emma.
Dr. GettIeman is finishing up
It's definiteIy not strep.
Thanks, doctor.
-WouId you Iike a IoIIipop?
-Do you even have to ask?
He is aIive!
It's so surprising that you and Joey
have known each other for so Iong...
...and I've never heard about you.
That's because we had
-That's okay. I have forgiven you.
Now we're friends again,
and everything's great.
WeII, wait. Is your mom okay?
PIease, we're trying
to have a conversation.
You're a Iot nicer
That's why you Iook so famiIiar!
-What?
-What?
What?
Do you not know each other?
Of course we do. He's pIaying a game
we used to pIay in high schooI.
We pretend we don't know each other.
you in the face for not being cooI?
Let me ask you something
How many sisters does Joey have?
-Six.
-No, he doesn't. He has seven.
What are you doing? I said seven!
Joey, why did you set me up
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry too. And just to be cIear,
I didn't hit his mother with a car.
AIthough I'd Iike to be
hit by one right now.
Yeah, no probIem.
You are unbeIievabIe. I spent so much
and cute and Ioose.
Who are you kidding?
You find some guy
off the street for me?
God, this is humiIiating!
I'm so sorry. If you don't Iike this guy,
I can find you a better one.
Mike? Mike?
I'm out of here.
It was nice meeting you.
-You're Ieaving too?
and you stiII have a Iot to pack.
You're right.
Maybe I shouIdn't go.
What?
So Nancy toId me about this job
at this great restaurant, Javu?
But it's just
a IittIe outside of TuIsa.
WeII, how far outside?
Manhattan?
And you're thinking of taking it?
Before, you said that being with me
oId job, me, new job.
I'm gonna miss this hand!
I know this is a Iot to ask...
...but, my God, this is
a once-in-a-Iifetime opportunity.
What happened to ''you can't Iive
without me four days a week''?
WeII, if you reaIIy think about it,
before you go to work...
...and Thursday when you get back...
...and I aIways work Iate on Tuesdays,
so reaIIy if you think about it...
...it's reaIIy just one day.
And weII, if we can't make it one day,
we got reaI probIems, my friend.
-I think you shouId take the job.
when you start chattering Iike a monkey.
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.
It's your dream job.
I can't make you pass it up.
Besides, I'm proud of you.
-You are?
peopIe say, ''Where's the missus'' ...
...I'II teII them she's a chef at Javu.
And then, when they stare
at me bIankIy...
...I'II make some offensive TuIsa joke,
and thus, begin my isoIation.
-How was the pediatrician?
It was reaIIy, reaIIy, reaIIy good.
-You promised not to say anything.
-I know.
Ross stiII sees his pediatrician!
I don't care.
Are you serious?
You stiII see Dr. GettIeman?
He is a briIIiant diagnostician!
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
SeriousIy, you gotta go
but he is a great doctor, okay?
He knows my medicaI history.
And every time I go in there,
he makes a big deaI.
You know,
''Look, it's my favorite patient.''
Does he say that before he sticks
his security bIanket to coIIege.
That was not a security bIanket.
That was a waII hanging.
It didn't spend much time on the waII!
Excuse me.
Hi. I was hoping to run into you.
Can we taIk?
Sure.
Yeah. There's someone
I'm so embarrassed.
PIease.
ReaIIy, I'm a pretty nice guy.
Just ask my paroIe officer.
ApparentIy, I'm not a funny guy.
WeII, why did you go aIong with that?
Because I was toId that I'd get
a free dinner, which I didn't.
And that I'd meet a pretty girI,
about yourseIf true?
My name is Mike.
And I do pIay piano.
-Prove it.
-There isn't a piano here.
That wouIdn't stand in the way
-ReaIIy? That's great.
-What kind of music do you pIay?
-Like acoustic, foIksy stuff, you know?
But right now I'm working on
a coupIe Iron Maiden covers.
Do you think that, maybe,
sometime I couId take you out?
You just caught me off guard.
Yeah, that wouId be nice.
Look at this! My two best friends!
Excuse me.
I don't mean to be a jerk...
...but the baby with the rash
came in after me.
-The doctor wiII be right with you, sir.
He's behind the eIephant.
Wow. So your chiId's a big fan
of the WaIdo books too?
Yeah, that's how I know.
-I'm Ross, by the way.
-Hi, I'm SaIIy.
So no ring. Can I assume
-It's hard, isn't it?
There's no time for a sociaI Iife.
Where are you gonna meet someone?
-WeII....
-Mommy, I can't--
Sea shore? Row boat.
Let's say, I don't know, you met
It's time to go in.
Mommy.
Mommy, what's wrong with that man?
Hey, I heIped you find WaIdo!
-Good, you haven't Ieft yet.
-Where have you been?
I got heId up
at Dr. GettIeman's office.
There was some guy
I reaIIy have to go, buddy.
Oh, man.
-Promise to caII me when you Iand?
-Of course I wiII. I Iove you.
I Iove you too.
Watch the tongue, peopIe.
We got a baby over here.
-Bye, ChandIer.
-Bye.
-What's the matter, Joe?
-I'm mad at you for Ieaving.
You know, you're nothing
but a big Ieaver.
A big Ieaver with a stupid suitcase.
Any chance you're trying to pick
-Okay, bye-bye.
Have a good trip. Okay.
Oh, my God.
Wait.
It goes oId job...
...new job...
...and you.
This is just something I have to do.
I know.
I Iove you so much.
I know that too.
Don't worry.
I'II be back before you know it.
Yes, it wiII be the same.
Because I know, that's how.
I promise.
You doubIe promise?
CaII me when you Iand.
-Can I taIk now?
-He had to board.

You are a bit of a drama queen.
You're so much better off. You just
never turns into anything serious.
l wouldn't say ''never.''
You know, there is that guy.
Okay, well, what about...?
Okay, there's gotta be someone.
-There isn't! That's what l'm saying.

Please don't cry because of me.

But if her face is
as nice as her ass....
-Mama!
-All right. Thanks.
-Have you talked to Chandler?
-l don't know. He has to work.
There's some big rush on the....
Damn it. l'm gonna have to start
listening when he talks about his job.
Why don't you fly out there
and surprise him?
l'd love to. l really miss him.
But l can't. l have one day off
the price of a plane ticket to you.
Of course he is.
Maybe l will go.
We'll have a little second honeymoon
at the Tulsa Ramada.
You should bring your black see-through
teddy with the attached garters.
-How do you know l have one of those?
that l meet in coffeehouses.
Gesundheit.
But....
This is hard. l'm kind of shy.
Seriously, you should see someone
about that cold.
lf it gets much worse, you could die.
-Anyway--
-l would love to go out with you.
Really? Great.
Did l--?
l figured l'd help you out.
You don't seem like the kind of guy
who does this a lot?
Damn it, Gunther, you gave it to me.
Oh, it's you.
With vegetarian corndogs.
Come on, l just want to talk to you.
About what? How few ova l have left?
Come on, l just wanna apologize
for what happened yesterday.
l'm sorry, Phoebe.
That's okay, Ross.
-So how'd the date go?
what you said, l cried.
l'm pretty sure he spent most of the night
just staring at me in horror.
But l couldn't know for sure
because my eyes were swollen shut.
You know l wasn't trying
you've never been in a serious relationship--
-Are we gonna do this again?
-Sorry.
-So he hasn't called?
-Would you call this girl:
''Thanks for...a lovely...evening''?
Now l feel terrible.

This could have been my serious guy.
He was sweet and smart and funny.
You know how hard it is
to meet a guy like that?
We are a rare breed.
Hey, maybe that's him.
Hello?
Could you hold on one sec?
-l need some privacy.
-ls it Mike?
No, it's a heavy breather.

<i...which is weird, because it seems</i
That's why.
Hey, Mike. Sorry to just drop by
from the coffeehouse?
l really, really need to talk
to you about something.
Unless....
You're not gonna try
and get me to join a cult, are you?
No, it's just, you know,
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
Phoebe is great. But....
l'm an idiot, okay?
Right before you guys went out...
...l accidentally got her all upset.
That's why she was weird.
Yes. Yeah, l....
Yeah, l said something stupid about her
never having had a serious relationship.
But you should know, she is
so much fun. A wonderful person.
-Please, don't blow her off.
We're going out tomorrow night.
l mean, l hope that's okay with you,
stranger from the coffeehouse.
That's great. So the crying
didn't turn you off?
l just got out of a nine-year relationship
Phoebe's a Mousketeer.
Well, then, l didn't need
to bother you.
You or the four other
Mike Hanigans l bothered.
One of whom was quite large
ls that true what you said?
Phoebe's never had
a serious relationship?
Of course she has.
lf she's never had
a serious relationship...
...do you think l'd go
of unstoppable moron?
-But you did say it.
-Yes. Yes, l did.
And l will also say...
...what l'm about to say...
...vis-à-vis...
...the following.
Phoebe has never had
a serious relationship...
...since...
...her super-serious relationship...
...with...
...Vikram.
-Vikram?
sent me to Texas?
Seven o'clock.
Maybe l'll hit the gym.
Who am l kidding?
Pay-per-view porn.
-Do not disturb! Do not disturb!
-Surprise!
-Monica?
l was just...
...watching some
regular television there.
What a pleasant surprise.
-l'm gonna go freshen up, okay?
-Okay, honey.
That was close.
-Hello.
and l caught him...
...molesting himself.
That couldn't have been pretty.
But you know, guys do that.
Well, the weird part is...
...he was getting off...
to a shark-attack show!
-No!
-Yes! Chandler watches shark porn!
-While watching sharks?
he was doing?
You know how many times
l've seen him jump up like that?
Believe me, l know what he was doing.
Man! Sharks!
l always knew there was something
weird about that dude.
You promised to love him
gets a disease or kills someone.
Not if he gets his jollies to <iJaws.</i
You know what, honey?
Guys are just different.
They like things
that we can't understand.
l once dated this guy
and l was this...
...naughty cavewoman
who he unfroze from a block of ice.
Are you talking about my brother?
l didn't disguise that very well, did l?
-Hey.
-Hi.
l went out with this girl last night.
and now you're going around again?
That's not even the weird part.
-She didn't remember sleeping with me!
-You don't remember sleeping with her.
But she should remember sleeping
with me. l am very memorable!
-You guys know.
-And whose fault is that?
What's the big deal?
You forgot, she forgot.
-Maybe you were having an off night.
-Hey!
l never have an off night. Okay?
Although, sometimes if l'm
and ask her out again?
You're both so slutty, you don't
remember who you slept with.
You're made for each other.
lnteresting.
Well, l'll go out with her again
and l'll try to get past it.
No salt! Bloaty!
-Joey?
sharks are sexy, do you?
No.
Wait a minute.
Wait, what was the Little Mermaid?
lt's open!
-Hey.
-Mike called! We're going out again!
Quick thing.
What did you do, Ross?
Oh, boy. You got mad at that part.
l went over there, you know,
to tell him how....
How great you are. But....
Well, you know me.
Blah-blah-blah.
-And l ended up telling him that....
never been in a serious relationship.
lf you hadn't just had a baby
with my best friend...
...l swear to Lucifer...
...a rabid dog would be feasting
on your danglers right now!
l think you'll feel differently
with some lie you made up, Ross.
-l'm just gonna be honest with him.
-Good.
Just be honest with him.
-l have nothing to be ashamed of.
-No.
So l haven't been in a relationship
then he can leave. Which he will.
And, you know, that's okay.
So l'll just be alone forever.
You know, all right.
lt'll be fine. lt'll be fine.
l'll go on walking tours
-Okay.
l'm trying to remember the last time
l opened a door and you weren't there.
Phoebe, are you okay?
Yeah. There's just....
There's something you should know.
Vikram just called.
So it was really a shock
after  years of marriage...
...my parents getting divorced.
-Sure. Yeah.
How can you not remember me?
What?
How could you not remember
that we slept together?
-What? When?
-l don't know!
l really, really think
Search your brain, all right? lt was...
...a certain amount of time ago.
l was here. You were here.
We had sex here, here, here....
Not there.
-Anything?
-No, it's not ringing any bells.
My God, woman!
How many people have you been with
We really gotta fix that doorknob.
Joey?
l slept with you!
And you obviously remember me!
Hey, l still got it!
So we're good.
l'll let myself out.
And l said, ''Okay, Vikram...
...you can't just call
every time you get lonely.
You gave up that right
had a baby with Ross.
Yeah, well....
Yeah.
But Emma's birth certificate
might say ''Geller'' ...
...but her eyes say ''Mukherjee.''
That is so wrong.
And on top of that, he's a glue sniffer?
l know. But he calls,
smooth-talking freelance kite designer.
lf you want, l'll mess him up for you.
You would do that?
Unless he's big.
lf he's really big, l'll send him...
...a rude letter.
l think there's somebody
better out there for you.
l mean, you know, l'm--
glue-sniffing with me.
Although, l do smell
the occasional Magic Marker.
Yeah. Anyway, l just....
l think l can make you happy.
-Okay, l can't do this.
-What's wrong?
Well, there is no Vikram.
in a long-term relationship.
l've never lived with a guy. l've never
even celebrated an anniversary.
So....
lf that's too weird for you...
...and you want to leave,
l understand.
ln fact, l'll close my eyes
-No.
Well....
Look, can l...?
Can l think you're a little weird
and also cool...
...for telling me the truth
and also want to kiss you?
l guess so.
Can l think it's cool
about the Magic Markers?
Definitely.
<iThis is Vikram.</i
<i>I need to talk to you about</i>
<i>the long-term relationship we had.</i>
<iCall me. I am in my kite-making studio.</i
Hi, honey, l'm home.
Hi.
-How was your flight?
-lt was great.
l ordered a pool float from the Sky Mall.
Why'd l do that?
Why don't you sit down.
Get yourself comfortable.
Because l have a little...
...surprise for you.
Well, well, well.
This is how much l love you.
<i>The great white....</i>
Honey?
Why am l watching
a bunch of sharks swimming around?
ls this--?
ls this not the good part?
Do you want me to fast-forward
got the right movie, that's all.
This is the only one
they had at our video store.
Though they did have something
Or does it always have to be sharks?
Does what always have to be sharks?
Look, we can do something else.
Do you want me to
-lt's okay. lt's okay.
l still love you.
-Let me be a part of this.
-Let me be a part of this!
l saw what you were doing in Tulsa.
Angry sharks turn you on!
No, they don't.
Then why were you watching them
and giving yourself a treat?
Oh, my God! When you came in,
American, girl-on-girl action.
Can l tell you how happy
that makes me?
You are an amazing wife.
Really, you are amazing. You were
actually gonna do this for me?
Where do you find the strength
but my confidence is shaken.
Did l sleep with her?
Did l not sleep with her?
Maybe this is a wake-up call. You know,
about your whole dating attitude.
You're in your s and you have
to meaningless experience.
Never even worrying that it doesn't
turn into something more serious.
You're right. l love my life!
l actually did sleep with her.
[ENGLlSH]
Oh, hey, you guys?
I couIdn't get a reservation

-So?
It's just spooky, that's aII.
So, is Mike coming to dinner?

I'd get mad at him, but I think

Now, before we get started,

-Yes. Ken, is it?
you feII asIeep in a meeting...
...and took the job without reaIizing
what you were saying yes to?
WeII, don't beIieve
everything you hear, Ken.
But yeah, that's true.
AII right, Iet's get started by taking
to bIow smoke up the boss's ass?
-I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
-No. I smoked for years. Then I quit.
Right now, I can't remember why.
You're not aIIowed to smoke
in this office, right?
Yes, in OkIahoma it's IegaI to smoke
-WouId Joey Iike two pizzas?
You don't know what I'm taIking about.
AII right, Iook. I don't smoke anymore.
But if the rest of you want to Iight up,
go ahead, it's fine.
So, you aII smoke, then?
You know, it's aImost rude
that I'm not smoking.
-That's not true. If you don't want--
If I smoke, my wife wouId kiII me.
I'm sorry, but isn't your wife
back in New York?
I've aIways Iiked you, Ken.
Trick or treat.
-Hey.
-And ''treat'' it is.
Wow. So gIad I changed.
I aImost wore my threadbare robe
I'm ovuIating...
...and ChandIer's gonna be home. So,
I thought we wouId try before dinner.
Oh, I thought we'd aII
go over together.
AII right, I'II just meet you there
I couId stay and watch.
-No!
-WeII, I didn't want to anyway.
You know, just thought
I'd be poIite and offer.
Wait, does this mean you'II be Iate?
We haven't seen each other
not aIIowed to smoke in pubIic spaces?
ActuaIIy, in OkIahoma smoking's IegaI
in offices with fewer than   peopIe.
Oh, you smoked.
No. I just happen to know a Iot of trivia
about smoking in different states.
For exampIe, in Hawaii,
-Do you think Monica wiII smeII it?
Are you kidding? That woman
has the nose of a bIoodhound.
And the breasts of a Greek goddess.
Pheebs?
I'm gonna go.
Okay. Something to cover the smeII.
Oven cIeaner.
Unscented.
WeIcome home.
I've missed you.
-You want to join me in the bedroom?
-No, thanks, I'm good.
Okay. So you want to pIay it
I just got off a pIane...
...so I'm feeIing gross.
I shouId take a shower.
-Come here, you don't need a shower.
-AII right, the truth is...
...I soiIed myseIf
I'm not gonna smoke anymore.
WeII, those are for you.
AII right. WeII, we'II just see you
when you get here. Bye.
Oh, that was my mom.
She's stuck in terribIe traffic.
That is now the third sign
-WeII, the first one is, I don't want to.
And second one, I'm not going.
I know this is the first time
we're Ieaving the baby.
I know how hard it is for you. But....
But everything's gonna be fine.
I mean, my mom is gonna be with her.
-She's great with kids.
Okay, that IittIe fatso was a terror!
-I just don't think I can do it.
-Know what? You can and you shouId.
ReaIIy, it wiII be good for you.
In fact, you know what?
Go ahead to the restaurant,
and I wiII wait for my mom...
...and then I'II meet you there.
Kick up your heeIs. Paint the town red!
-You need to Iearn some new sIang.
-I'm serious. Come on, you shouId go.
Here. No, just go.
-WeII--
-No, no! You know what?
You're not getting back in there!
that I Ieft my keys.
HoIy moIey, are we in a pickIe now!
Where is everyone?
They're  minutes Iate.
-I know.
-I'm starving.
I knew we were coming here tonight.
I onIy had one Iunch today.
So, are we expecting
the rest of our party shortIy?
Yes, they are expected presentIy.
Yeah.
Their arrivaI is in the offing.
Right. We have a tabIe for two avaiIabIe.
-Perhaps you'd--
They shan't be Iong.
It's just that we do have
some Iarge parties waiting.
Oh, one reaIIy does have a stick
up one's ass, doesn't one?
Why wouId you start smoking again?
That's not enough time to--
That's totaIIy unreIated.
How can you smoke in this day and age?
Have you not seen that ad?
Where the IittIe kid waIks
through Grandpa? It's chiIIing!
I messed up. It was a meeting.
of you eating Ding Dongs...
...without taking the tinfoiI off!
You said that was sexy!
Okay, Iook, can we just drop this?
I'm not gonna smoke again.
That's right, because I forbid you
to smoke again.
You forbid me?
I've fIown a Iong way
I'm very, very upset right now.
-Is this the most upset you couId be?
-I think so.
WeII, then I might as weII...
...do this.
Not reaIIy sure what to do now.
I'II teII you what we're gonna do.
We're aIready Iate
for Phoebe's birthday dinner.
So you're going to put out
and go have sex.
Fine. What?
What, do you have
cigarettes in your ears?
Sex! This is the Iast day I'm ovuIating.
If we don't do it...
...we're gonna have to wait
-AII right, fine, I'II do it, but no taIking!
-And no cuddIing.
-And no kissing your neck.
Oh, good! I hate it when you do that!
And Iots of kissing your neck!
Okay, weII, the super's not home.
But my mother's gonna be here,
and she has the key.
I can't wait that Iong. You have to do
gonna be fine. The baby's sIeeping.
-What if she jumps out of the bassinet?
-Can't hoId her head up, but jumped.
Oh, my God!
I Ieft the water running!
You did not Ieave the water running.
-You haven't cooked since  .
Is the window open? If the window's
open a bird couId fIy in and....
My God, you know what?
I think you're right.
-Listen.
An eagIe fIew in!
Landed on the stove and caught fire!
The baby, seeing this, jumps across
the apartment to the mighty bird's aid.
The eagIe, however, misconstrues this
as an act of aggression...
...and grabs the baby in its taIon.
MeanwhiIe, the faucet
are Iocked in a death grip...
...swirIing around the whirIpooI
that fiIIs the apartment!
Boy, are you gonna be sorry
if that's true.
-HeIIo.
switching to a smaIIer tabIe.
Maybe we shouId just eat now.
You can't order untiI the entire
party's arrived. Restaurant poIicy.
WeII, how about this?
Another tabIe Ieaves, right...
...but there's stiII some food Ieft
about peopIe eating that?
-It's frowned upon.
-But it happens.
-AII right, I got to go to the bathroom.
-You can't go.
No, no, no.
You don't have to manhandIe me.
-Where?
-Okay.
Thank you. Wow.
WiII you stop staring at us now?
That depends. WiII your friend stop
drinking oIive oiI directIy from the bottIe?
ProbabIy not.
FinaIIy. You guys made it.
Pheebs, who the heII--?
What is taking you so Iong,
That wiII make a baby.
Look, I can't do this. I can't make Iove
to you whiIe we're fighting this way.
Oh, sure. Now you're Mr. Sensitivity.
But when you wanted to have sex
after my uncIe's funeraI--
That was a ceIebration of Iife!
AII right, I'm not gonna do this.
Is this the way you want our baby
so hard about the smoking.
So you had a few cigarettes.
It's not the end of the worId.
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.
You are incredibIe.
And Iisten,
I wiII hide it so much better from you.
-Want to?
-Let's ceIebrate Iife!
Okay!
Oh, God.
Oh, thank God you're okay.
I'm sorry we Ieft.
Mommy wiII never Ieave you again.
Never, ever, ever again.
Great. So Iet's get going.
I mean it. After what just happened,
to go to the beauty parIor.
And he got so upset
he took off aII his cIothes...
...tucked his wiIIy between his Iegs...
...and cried out, ''Mommy, I'm a girI.
Take me with you.''
Somehow, over time,
-What?
-I am stiII so mad at you for smoking!
-But you said you forgave me.
It was just a coupIe of cigarettes,
no big deaI.
I was ovuIating and you said you
-That's right. I got mine.
I feeI so used.
WeII, I guess they're not coming.
You want to just order?
Thank you.
Waiter? AII right, this is gonna
go fast, so try to keep up.
Risotto with shaved truffIes
and the BordeIaise sauce...
...unIess any of that stuff I just said
means ''snaiIs.''
It does not.
Tomato tart, and which of the pastas
wouId you recommend?
-Oh, weII they're both exquisite--
It's food time. Bring it, bitch.
-Sorry about that.
-It's quite aII right.
Oh, can I make a speciaI request?
Can you bring everything
as it's ready?
-Appetizers, entrées, we don't care.
-What did I ever do to you?
Nothing, bitch.
You guys are over an hour Iate.
-What happened to you two?
-So sorry.
-We got Iocked out of the apartment.
-That's a great story. Can I eat it?
And then RacheI wasn't sure
and I did what I had to do.
And that's Judy over there at the bar
with Emma?
This is for the best. I'm not distracted,
worrying about Emma...
...how she's doing at home, and I'm
-What?
Judy? She spit--
Judy, Iook aIive, Judy!
-Thank you.
-Thanks.
Oh, everything Iooks deIicious.
What shouId I have?
Never hit a woman.
I know what you mean,
this menu's incredibIe.
Ross bruises Iike a peach.
He bruises Iike a peach.
Okay, I'II have the fig saIad
okay?
-Hurry--
-Happy birthday!
Son of a bitch!
-Where have you been?
-WeII, we had a IittIe fight.
I wouId never Iie
you were a Kennedy.
Thanks.
Thanks. Wow.
A IittIe tight, isn't it?
Why didn't you get a bigger tabIe?
You had a big tabIe
but they made you move.
Shut up, Monica.
Oh, weII, I suppose that ChandIer
wiII have the manipuIative shrew.
How did I miss that?
-I'II give you another minute.
-What, where you going?
He said she wanted the shrew!
Rach, come on, Emma's fine.
You're turning into an obsessive
mother, okay? You need to stop.
You ever hear the story about when
-They aIready know it.
We've been waiting for you
for a Iong time.
-You shouId order.
-That's okay.
-I toId the waiter what they want.
Everybody has ordered.
I wouId Iike to start the ceIebration
and make a toast to Phoebe.
-She dropped her sock.
-What?
-No. No, Emma dropped her sock.
-How do you know that?
-Mom's here?
I wanted to have Iunch with her today.
She toId me she was out of town.
She stiII has not noticed
that the baby's sock is on the ground.
It's a good toast.
Look, wiII you pIease get her attention?
Mommy?
Mother.
Oh, for God's sake, Judy,
that is this evening?
Look, I know you have a Iot going on...
...but aII I wanted to do was have
dinner with my friends on my birthday.
And you are aII so Iate, and you
didn't even have the courtesy to caII.
WeII, it's too Iate now.
Pheebs, I don't think that's us.
Oh, weII, this is-- This is not over!
and Ieft Emma at home.
''We''?
There are some aduIt wiIIy stories
they don't know.
We shouId've been stronger.
-What is going on with you two?
-WeII, you see, I'm ovuIating.
Oh, yeah, that's what she says.
Maybe you're not ovuIating. Maybe
I just can't get enough.
You're not gonna beIieve this.
She tricked me
into having sex with her.
So? You got to have sex, right?
What's the matter with me?
Why am I such a girI?
-Okay. That was Mike.
We are here   percent...
...and we Iove you, and we are ready
to start your birthday ceIebration.
You guys, that means the worId to me.
Okay, I'm gonna take off.
What?
I Iove you guys too, but,
Mike got off work earIy.
Wait.
I'm not the-- I'm not the kind of girI
can we take Emma home?
That's a good idea. Our babysitter
just pounded another chardonnay.
-Bye, you guys.
-Bye.
See you. WeII, I guess it's just us.
So, I'm probabIy stiII ovuIating.
with a Kennedy, have you?
ActuaIIy, Richard was a Kennedy
on his mother's side.
Why did you break up with that guy?
-You're gonna go do it?
-We don't have much time.
Once the egg descends
is returning.
No, just me. AII aIone.
Dinner for six for one.
WeII, you boys are about
to see something reaIIy speciaI.
-How was everything?
-ExceIIent.
The shrew, in particuIar, was exquisite.
I hope you've got some room Ieft.
Joey. Joey.
This is the best birthday ever!
ENGLISH
HeIIo.
HeIIo.
I Iove my new job!
-Honey, you're screaming.
Twice as big as AIIessandro's.
Oh, that's great.
And cIean? Not just heaIth
department-cIean, Monica-cIean!
Awesome.
Oh, and the peopIe are so nice.
There's this one guy, Jeffrey,
he's the maître d' .
ChandIer, you wiII Iove him!
He is without a doubt
-I know.
-You need both hands for that?
-Yeah, I kind of do.
WeII, how's this?
Are you sure that's sweet enough?
Look at you two hoIding hands.
Is this getting serious?
Have you not taIked about it yet?
Am I making you uncomfortabIe?
If you were bigger you'd hit me.
I'm sorry.
It's obviousIy way too earIy
for us to be having that conversation.
-Is it?
someone for a reaIIy Iong time.
Then again, I didn't think I'd meet
someone Iike you. And....
This may be crazy-soon,
but I want you to have this.
No, not.... That's gum.
Oh, five bucks!
-I know. Keep digging.
Sorry.
It's a key.
To be honest, I think I'd prefer
the five doIIars.
-It's to my apartment.
-Wow!
Big step for Phoebe and Mike.
I don't want you to feeI Iike you
-Thank God.
Wow. I was starting to think
I'd never meet someone that...
...I wanted to do this with.
Here you go.
-This is cooI.
-It reaIIy is.
I know it. It is amazing.
for another four weeks...
...but we wouId Iike our nanny
to start right away...
...so that Emma couId get
a chance to know her.
I think that's reaIIy smart.
The easier we can make the
-Not reaIIy.
AII right. WeII, thank you
so much for coming.
-Thank you.
-It was reaIIy nice to meet you.
-We wiII caII you.
I'm gonna need three days' notice.
Okey-dokey!
We're never gonna find a nanny.
Come on, Rach. We wiII. I promise.
We have more interviews.
Worse comes to worst, we can aIways
reconsider the first one we met with.
-What, the bIond with no bra?
EarIy ChiIdhood Education.
She worked for her Iast famiIy
for three years.
Hi. I'm Sandy.
And she's a IittIe mannish.
Oh, my God! David!
-Is this a bad time?
-No, it's a great time! Come in!
Wow! Hi!
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here?
who gave us our grant...
...why it's a positive thing that
we've spent aII their money...
...and accompIished nothing.
Who cares? It got you here.
It got me to New York.
Then I got in a cab at the airport...
...and the guy said, ''Where to?''
I just gave him your address.
Can you just stand there for a moment?
Boy.
There's an oId Russian expression
Thank you.
You shouId see me when--
ActuaIIy, no, I Iook pretty good.
Are you kidding?
You know, when you don't see
you start thinking
''Come on, don't be crazy,
nobody's that beautifuI.''
But, weII, you are.
WeII, so are you seeing anyone?
No.
I'm just the worst person ever!
How can I not teII David
that I'm seeing Mike?
Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
He said, ''Are you seeing someone?''
I was Iooking in his eyes...
...and I was just thinking,
''Oh, my God, it's David. David's here.''
He's so irresistibIe.
-ReaIIy? The scientist guy?
-ReaIIy? ChandIer?
Continue.
Then it gets worse...
...because I toId him
-I know! EviI!
I Iike Mike so much, you know?
It's just going reaIIy weII. Oh, my God!
Isn't it ironic that David
wouId show up...
...on the same day that
my IifeIong search for irony...
...you can imagine how happy I am!
-What are you gonna do?
-I mean, I guess I just have to...
...teII David that nothing
can happen between us.
UnIess I don't.
You know, compIicated moraI situation?
-No right, no wrong?
with Joey.
Funniest guy she's ever met.
I'm funny, right?
What do you know? You're a door.
You just Iike knock-knock jokes.
Save it for inside.
So OkIahoma's a crazy pIace. You know,
they caII it the Sooner State.
FrankIy, I'd sooner be in any other state!
And what's with OkIahoma
having a panhandIe?
Can aII states have stuff Iike that?
Hey, yeah, I'm from the waistband
we headed over to the crotch.
Was your cabin pressurized?
And don't get me started on the way
the peopIe from TuIsa taIk.
Okay.
What's with the word ''y'aII''? You know,
just two words just pushed together?
Are we aII aIIowed to do that?
couId be your noodIe.
And fried chicken couId be fricken.
Waiter? Waiter, excuse me,
I'II have the fricken!
See, that's funny with the fricken, right?
No, it just reminds me of something
this guy did today at work.
I toId you about that funny guy, Jeffrey,
You probabIy had to be there...
...but it was Liza MinneIIi Iocked
in our freezer eating a raw chicken.
-Were you there?
-No, but it sounds fricken funny.
I reaIIy understand how hard it's gotta be
a piece of your heart.
Sandy, that's exactIy what it is.
Are you gay?
I'm sorry, that's our Ross.
He's just Mr. Shoot Straight From The Hip.
It's okay. I get that a Iot doing what I do.
But I am straight. I'm engaged, actuaIIy.
-Her name's DeIia.
-That's pretty.
So you're just, Iike,
for some peopIe.
But I reaIIy beIieve the most satisfying
thing you can do with your Iife...
...is take care of a chiId.
Okay.
Like at my Iast job.
I met DanieI when he was
 weeks oId.
And I got to watch him grow
-Yeah, kids say aII kinds of crap.
Oh, God, she must need
her diaper changed.
-I can take care of that, if you want.
-That wouId be great.
Just so you know, these dinosaur toys
we shouIdn't try him out.
Because it's weird!
Why?
Wow, I never Iooked at it that way.
What kind of a job is that for a man?
A nanny?
I mean, it's Iike if a woman
wanted to be--
Yes?
King?
I hope you don't mind. I used
honey cream. It'II dry that rash right up.
PIus, it keeps the hands young.
Yes! Sandy, you're hired!
That's great!
I'm sorry.
It's just such an emotionaI thing
when you're weIcomed into a new famiIy.
Oh, God. Come here.
You gotta be at Ieast bi.
I need you to set me up for a joke.
When Monica's around,
ask me about fire trucks.
I don't know, ChandIer. I'm not
doesn't depend on it.
I know, right?
Why are we doing this?
Monica says that her maître d' is
the funniest guy she's ever met.
-SeriousIy? She actuaIIy said that?
-Yes. Am I crazy to be this upset?
-No! Being funny's your thing!
''Iame with women'' !
Hi! There you are.
Fire trucks!
-Hi.
-Hi.
I brought you this from Minsk.
You're not gonna beIief this.
This is Iemon-fIavored vodka.
Yeah, we actuaIIy have this here.
I traded four pairs of Levi's for that.
Thanks anyway.
Wow. You Iook even more beautifuI
-I can't get away with stuff Iike that.
It sounded sexy in my head, so I....
No, no, it's not that.
Remember when you asked me if
I was seeing someone and I said no?
WeII, I am. His name's Mike.
-I shouId've toId you.
-No.
WeII, yeah.
I'm sorry. I wanted to teII you,
-Right, yes.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-WeII, it's okay. I understand.
WeII, are you happy with this guy?
-I am happy.
-Damn it.
I'm sorry. I don't mean that.
Who cares. Leave him.
I don't mean that. Yes, I do.
I'm sorry.
I think I shouId probabIy go.
But, David, I just want you to know that,
you know...
...teIIing you this is one of the
a VIadnik carnivaI, either.
-Can we at Ieast hug goodbye?
-Of course. Yeah.
You know, and a kiss on the cheek
wouIdn't be totaIIy inappropriate.
-No. No.
-Yeah?
It's two on each cheek...
-...and one on the Iips.
-WeII, if that's what they do in Minsk.
In New York, it's--
Oh, boy.
Is everything aII right?
Oh, yeah. No, it's fine. It's fine.
Sandy was just teIIing me about how he
proposed to his fiancée...
...and it was so beautifuI.
Her favorite fIower is the cameIIia.
-Yeah. Excuse me.
Do you reaIize that man has cried
in our apartment three times?
I haven't cried that many times
since I moved in!
Come on, Ross, you got a IittIe misty
from my coIIeagues at the museum.
-Okay? They aII chipped in for that.
-They must have aII Ioved you very much.
Look, Ross, Sandy's just sensitive.
That's aII.
Okay, okay. See, that is the probIem.
These are amazing!
Sandy made madeIeines.
This is exactIy
what I'm taIking about.
What kind of a guy makes deIicate
French cookies?
They're not even butch,
I don't know what to say.
I mean, I never thought of you as a guy
who needed his men to be men.
I gotta teII you, Ross, it's not Iike you
just came in from branding cattIe.
Hey, there's sensitive and
Ergo, we shouId keep kissing.
-No, no. No.
-But....
Ergo.
Look, David, if you had never Ieft, then...
...yeah, we'd probabIy stiII be together
right now.
But you did Ieave. And I'm with Mike
Thank you!
Did RacheI teII you we hired
a maIe nanny?
I think that's great!
Did she teII you he pIays the recorder,
recites poetry and bakes madeIeines?
-How are they?
-Thank you!
-That's Iike a woman wanting to be--
-What?
-What's the end of that sentence?
-Yes. What is the end of that sentence?
A penis modeI!
Anyway, did you teII ChandIer
-Wow!
ReaIIy? Do you not know ChandIer?
Is that why he's acting so weird?
He's jeaIous?
Oh, my God, that is crazy.
-It's not Iike I'm attracted to Jeffrey.
-So what?
Being funny is ChandIer's thing.
-Are you kidding?
That's Iike ChandIer saying he met someone
who was more uptight than you.
-Excuse me?
-I'm sorry. Sorry. More controIIing than you.
-WeII, that's better.
at maIe wet nurse.
You are on a roII, mister!
If I'd known you guys were coming over,
I wouId've brought more pizza.
Okay! Okay! Stop it, you!
You stop it!
What is so funny about that?
Monica?
I don't know, it's....
that funny thing. You're a funny guy!
Did you teII her what we taIked about?
So those were pity Iaughs?
Pity Iaughs?!
Honey, Iisten.
You have nothing to worry about
with Jeffrey.
Oh, yeah? Is he funnier than me?
WeII, you're different funny.
I mean, you're more sarcastic.
WeII, he does bits and impressions
whose wife made him die inside.
Honey, you know I think you're hiIarious.
You know that joke
you toId me Iast week?
The one about Jerry Lewis
and the girI with the Iazy eye.
That sIayed me.
Hey! I made up that joke
-Yep, that's my thing.
So how many guys have your key?
It's not as bad as it Iooks.
I was saying goodbye to an oId friend.
Your Iipstick's on his mouth.
We just happen to wear the same shade.
No, David and I did used to go out.
But years ago. And he Iives in Minsk.
He's onIy in town for a coupIe days.
-Did you--?
-No. No.
-Kiss him?
Look, she reaIIy Iikes you.
In fact, she stopped
what was a pretty amazing kiss.
-David, David, David.
-No, no. He shouId hear this.
I don't think you reaIize
-Why?
What are you gonna do about it?
WeII, I'II show you
what I'm gonna do about it.
-Oh, reaIIy? ReaIIy?
-You want some of that?
Stop it! Stop it!
weII, you just better watch out.
-If I go to Minsk, you better watch out.
-Oh, you're going to Minsk?
-WeII, I might.
-ReaIIy?
WeII, if you do, come in the spring.
-Bye.
-Hey, what, are you kidding me?
-Right-o. Right-o.
Take good care of her.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
If you want your key back,
I totaIIy understand.
-It's never gonna happen again, right?
come to Minsk, that's my number.
We'II party up VIadnik-styIe.
Yeah! AII right!
Hey, Ross! Check it out!
Sandy taught me ''Hot Cross Buns'' !
ReaIIy? Sounded Iike ''Three BIind Mice.''
-''Three BIind Mice'' goes Iike this.
-I swear to God.
-Who's up for puppets?
who's gonna be the Grumpus?
How exactIy is a -month-oId
supposed to appreciate puppets?
Studies show that the movement and
coIors heIp their cerebraI deveIopment.
The whimsicaI characters are just for us.
I want to be Mr. WiggIemunch!
Oh, my God.
WeII, I guess we know who's
-Oh, I'm sorry.
PIease apoIogize to Sandy
and the SnuffIebumps for me.
-You know, he was just doing his job.
-You know what?
I'm sorry I'm the onIy one who isn't
-No! You know what?
I wouId never force you to hire someone
you were this uncomfortabIe with.
That's true.
Thank you.
You want to fire him,
so you have to go do it.
So you see, WiggIemunch,
has any funny OkIahoma jokes...
...teII him to e-maiI me at
www-dot-ha-ha-not-so-much-dot-com!
Honey, you can reIax.
Last night at work Jeffrey
toId this reaIIy sexist joke.
-After that, not so funny anymore.
You gotta keep it smart, peopIe!
Don't miss that fIight.
You know I Iove you.
I Iove you too.
-And I Iike you as a friend.
-Right.
-See you Iater.
-No, he stiII kiIIs me.
Last night he had me Iaughing so hard,
I swear a IittIe pee came out.
Here goes.
I can't watch. It's Iike firing EImo.
Sandy? Hi.
-Hi.
-We....
We kind of need to taIk.
I'm afraid it's not working out.
I mean, RacheI and I think you are great
-You! You feeI!
I just feeI...
...that the chemistry isn't right.
I'm sorry.
We're more than happy to give you
a good recommendation.
No, that's okay. I had a Iot of offers
-Oh, damn you, GeIIer!
Anyway, weII I'm gIad
there's no hard feeIings.
None at aII. You need to be happy
with whoever is in your home.
AIthough, if you don't mind teIIing me...
...what was the probIem? Maybe it's
It's my issue.
What is it?
PIease?
You know, I'm just not that comfortabIe
with a guy who's as sensitive as you.
That's fair.
AIthough, can I ask,
why do you think that is?
Why? I don't know.
Maybe because of my father?
You know, when I was growing up,
I wasn't the athIete I am now.
I pIay squash!
Anyway, I aIways got the feeIing
he thought I was too sensitive.
That must have been hard.
It was hard.
I remember I was in my bedroom,
pIaying with my dinosaurs....
PIaying and Iearning.
And my father waIks in and says,
outside pIaying Iike a reaI boy?''
-But you are a reaI boy.
-I know I am!
And when it's summer and it's hot,
why can't you wear a tank top?!
It's aII right. Crying is good.
and be a big girI, just Iike your daddy.
And what's the one kind of boat
that can never ever sink?
-What kind?
-A friend ship!
Wow! You bIow my mind!
I gotta go.
-How much do I owe you?
-Okay, bye-bye, Skadandy.
ENGLISH
And that's why,
no matter what Mommy says...
...we reaIIy were on a break.
Yes, we were.
Yes, we were.
You are the cutest IittIe baby ever.
You're just a IittIe-bitty baby,
you know that? But you've got....
You've got big, beautifuI eyes.
Yes, you do. And a....
And a big, round beIIy.
Big baby butt.
I Iike big butts.
Oh, my God, Emma.
done that before, have you?
You've never done that before.
Daddy made you Iaugh, huh?
WeII, Daddy and Sir Mix-A-Lot.
What? What?
You wanna hear some more?
I'm a terribIe father.
-What do you know about investments?
show, and I shouId do something with it.
-What do you do with your money now?
-It's taped to the back of my toiIet tank.
I didn't say that.
It's in a bank guarded by robots.
-Do you have any ideas?
That'd be kind of cooI, huh?
Pitching in on the weekends,
heIping to pIant the emus.
Joe, emus are birds.
You raise them for meat.
Yeah. Right!
PeopIe eat birds. Bird meat.
Do they just fIy into your mouth?
a bucket of fried bird.''
Or maybe just a wing. Or a....
You shouId consider something
a IittIe Iess risky.
I think reaI estate is
your best investment.
The Fed just Iowered the rates, and the
a great apartment? Richard!
And you know whose knowIedge of
her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
-My dad toId me. They pIay goIf together.
-WeII, maybe I'II join them sometime.
I just hope the cIub doesn't
off his face.
And then the doctor said Emma
has doubIed her birth weight...
...she is in the th percentiIe and she's
gonna start eating soIid foods soon.
-That's great!
-No idea.
Hi! You have to heIp me pick a dress.
I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight.
Wow, the boyfriend's parents.
That's a big step.
-ReaIIy? That hadn't occurred to me.
on Park Avenue.
Yeah, she can't be herseIf.
Okay, so, aII right, which dress?
-You can say neither.
-Oh, God. Neither.
You can say it niceIy.
I'm sorry. We'II take you shopping.
It'II be fine.
You are in such good hands,
but not in a gross way.
Just kind of Iike, ''Mr. Pinzer, I can
see where WaIIace gets his good Iooks.''
-You went out with WaIIace Pinzer?
-He took the SATs for me.
-I knew you didn't get a  !
teII her how amazing her son is.
Take it from me. Moms Iove me.
Ross' mom one time actuaIIy said...
...I am Iike the daughter
that she never had.
-She said what?
to meet Mike's parents.
She's so nervous. It's so sweet.
Guess what. I made Emma Iaugh today.
You what? And I missed it...
...because I was giving a makeover
to that stupid hippie?!
Yeah, and it was Iike
a reaI IittIe person Iaugh too.
It was Iike:
OnIy not creepy.
-What did you do to make her Iaugh?
who Iikes to have sex...
...with women with giant asses?
You know what,
if you think about it...
...it actuaIIy promotes
a heaIthy body image...
...because even big butts...
...or ''juicy doubIes'' are....
PIease don't take her away from me.
Hi, come on in.
the pIace? Went bankrupt?
MedicaI maIpractice?
Choked on his own mustache?
He's buying a much bigger pIace.
It's got a great view of CentraI Park--
That's enough out of you.
Is there anything we shouId know
There's a Iot of Iight, a new kitchen.
I think you guys wouId be
very happy here.
No, we're not together.
We're definiteIy not a coupIe.
-Okay. Sorry.
pretty insuIted by that.
What, I'm not good enough for you?
We are not gonna have
this conversation again.
Look at this pIace.
Why am I so intimidated by this guy?
Pretentious art.
aII he does is sit around...
...crying about Iosing Monica
to a reaI man.
-You don't think he's here, do you?
-I don't know.
It's a nice pIace, but I gotta say,
I mean, who does he think he is?
<iMagnum Force, Dirty Harry,</i
<i>Cool Hand Luke.</i>
-Oh, my God.
-What?
There's a tape here
It's probabIy a sex tape.
Wait a minute.
This says ''Monica.''
And this is Richard's apartment.
Get there faster!
Wow. You Iook...
...Iike my mom.
I'm wearing pantyhose.
-Great! Come on in.
-Okay.
Thank you.
-Oh, my God. You're rich.
-No, my parents are rich.
WeII, so? They gotta die someday.
Theodore and Bitsy.
Theodore, Bitsy...
...what a deIight.
-It's so nice to finaIIy meet you.
-And you.
Your home is IoveIy.
Thank you. I'II give you a tour Iater.
It's actuaIIy three fIoors.
HoIy crap!
Why don't you come meet our friends.
Try and stop me.
-What are you doing?
but you don't have to do this.
I want them to get to know Phoebe,
not ''Phoebe.''
It is fun, though, isn't it?
-You've got it.
-AII right.
It's hard to stop.
WeII, come on.
Phoebe, these are our friends
TeII us a IittIe bit about yourseIf.
-So where are you from?
-Okay.
WeII, aII right.
OriginaIIy, I'm from upstate...
...but then my mom kiIIed herseIf,
a burned-out Buick LeSabre for a whiIe.
Which was okay. That was okay.
UntiI I got hepatitis, you know...
...because this pimp spit
in my mouth and....
But I got over it.
And, anyway, now I'm
a freeIance massage therapist...
...which isn't aIways steady money,
I don't need to watch it.
I mean, what good couId
possibIy come from watching it?
WeII, we know I'm gonna watch it.
-Hey, dude, what's up?
-Don't judge me! I'm onIy human!
Did you take that tape?
I had to! Imagine you were married
you need to know what was on it?
I don't know. Who am I married to?
Some girI.
She hot?
How did she get me to settIe down?
AII right, I'm gonna watch it.
I mean, it's probabIy
not even what I think it is.
Even if it is, it can't possibIy be as
bad as what I'm picturing in my head.
Can it?
In my experience,
I'II teII you.
-Then you have to watch it for me.
-What?
Just for a few seconds
so I can know what it is. PIease?
AII right, fine. But if I enjoy this,
-It's okay. It's just a footbaII game.
-It's just footbaII?
-You were aII worried for nothing.
It's footbaII! It's just footbaII!
This is great! This is the first time
I've ever enjoyed footbaII!
I think it may be customary to get a beer.
What the...?
-What are you doing?
-No, you're doing fine. ReaIIy.
-Why don't you go taIk to my dad.
-Okay, okay, okay.
-StiII sure about me being myseIf?
-AbsoIuteIy.
Though maybe just
where Mike gets his good Iooks from.
WeII....
-You must work out aII the time.
-Not aII the time. I do the best I can.
Yeah, I bet. Look out!
-Oh, my God. Are you okay?
-I recentIy had surgery.
-I'm so sorry.
-I reaIIy am sorry.
How couId you know? Why wouIdn't
you punch me in the stomach?
Did you just hit my dad?
Yes. I'm sorry. I've never met
a boyfriend's parents before.
But, I mean, you have met
She Iooks nice. I can taIk to her.
You do that, and I'm gonna go check
my dad for signs of internaI bIeeding.
Bitsy? Listen, I wanted to thank you
again for having me here tonight.
WeII, not at aII.
AIso, I just want you to know
-It's a testament to how he was raised.
EspeciaIIy to you,
because he's very respectfuI of women.
-Is he reaIIy?
-He is so considerate of my feeIings.
You know, I think you'd aIso Iike
No, not in Iike a sissy way.
When he gets going...
...he can rattIe a headboard
Iike a saiIor on Ieave.
That's...my boy.
Awesome.
Okay, pIease Iaugh for Mommy.
PIease?
PIease Iaugh for Mommy.
Not funny, huh?
WeII, so is it...
...onIy offensive noveIty rap?
Or maybe just, you know, rap in generaI.
onIy because I Iove you so much.
And I know that you're
not gonna teII anybody.
Emma, you're Iaughing! You are!
You reaIIy do Iike big butts, don't you?
You beautifuI IittIe weirdo.
You missed it! She was Iaughing!
It was amazing.
It was amazing. It was the most
beautifuI, beautifuI sound.
I know, isn't it?
A coupIe of things I tried. Different....
Just sang a IittIe
''The Itsy-Bitsy Spider.''
You sang ''Baby Got Back,'' didn't you?
Nothing eIse worked!
That girI is aII about the ass!
And then it goes back to the chorus.
ResoIve.
to hear it...
...but no one had spoken
in   minutes.
Phoebe writes Iots of songs. What was
that one you sang the other night?
''Pervert Parade''?
-''Ode to a Pubic Hair''?
Phoebe's a vegetarian.
No, that's okay. That's okay.
I mean, I am a vegetarian...
...except for veaI.
Yeah. No. VeaI I Iove.
-Phoebe, you don't have to eat that.
running through it.
Yummy.
So...
...what do you think?
So you stoIe that tape
from Richard's apartment?
Listen to the judgment
from the porn star!
That tape was never meant
if this conversation were in private.
Monica, Iook, I don't think you and I
have any secrets anymore.
Not ready to joke about it yet?
See you Iater.
Why in the worId wouId you take this tape?
a tape Iike that and not be bothered.
It'd just be another saucy anecdote...
...for him to share at his men's cIub
over brandy and mustaches.
Is aII of this about you not being abIe
to grow a mustache?
This is about you and Richard.
Iook at it whenever he wants.
Isn't that sad?
Can't you see how pathetic that is?
Don't be jeaIous.
You shouId feeI bad for him.
Yeah, weII, poor Richard, he....
I can grow a mustache.
This is not our probIem. We have
around with him, with your...
...cowboy boots in the air.
Cowboy boots? I've never worn
cowboy boots in my whoIe Iife.
Good, good. PIay more
because I wanna see how it ends.
-That's not me!
Spring for a new bIank tape, doctor!
Yes, but the important thing is
that we have each other, right?
WeII, yeah. It's just so rude!
-And the way we did it was a Iot better--
-Are you going to finish that sentence?
I can't imagine what he sees in her.
She actuaIIy makes me miss
-We were just chitchatting.
-How's your friend?
-A IittIe better.
Do you know who's moving back into
town? Tom and Sue's daughter, Jen.
You remember her, MichaeI.
-PIease, darIing, Iet's be honest.
You can have aII the saiIor fun
you want with that one.
-But Iet's be reaI.
-AII right, stop.
AII Phoebe has done is try and get you
-MichaeI, a pimp spit in her mouth.
So what? If I can get past that,
it shouIdn't bother you.
You don't have to Iike her.
Just accept the fact that I do.
If you can't even be civiI
-Yeah, the woman you what?
The woman I Iove.
I Iove you.
Something I shouIdn't say for
the first time, in front of my parents...
...and Tom and Sue.
Who are, by the way, the most sinfuIIy
boring peopIe I've ever met in my Iife.
-I Iove you too.
-I had a great time.
It was reaIIy top-drawer.
And here's something rich.
Thirteen bathrooms in this pIace,
I threw up in the coat cIoset.
Ta-ta!
One more time from the top!
RacheI, pIease!
get the pIates down?
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't
we use our wedding china today?
Or we couId save them
for a fancy speciaI occasion.
How about this:
Iike I'm a chiId.
No, I just think we shouId save our china
for something reaIIy speciaI.
Like if the queen of EngIand
comes over.
Honey, she keeps canceIing on us.
They're expensive.
What is the point of having them
if we never use them?
Okay. But if something breaks
and then the queen comes over....
-I wiII expIain it to her.
<i>from Muskogee, Oklahoma.</i>
Muskogee?
That's Iike four hours from TuIsa!
Y'aII Iook great!
That's right, I said ''y'aII!''
<i>Here's the float with the stars</i>
...Days of Our Lives.
Oh, my God!
Aren't you one of the stars of the
stuff Iike this down on my arm!
Stupid Iong sIeeves!
-What are you gonna do?
-I'II come up with a good reason...
...why I wasn't there.
The producers are gonna be mad.
They sat us down and said:
''Everyone has to be there,  a.m. sharp.
-Amy!
Hide my rings.
Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
Do you have a hair straightener?
Hi.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Hair straightener.
-I haven't seen you in, Iike, a year.
-I know. I know. I've just been crazed.
WeII, me too. I had a baby.
I decorated Dad's office.
Yeah? WeII, unIess you pushed a desk
honey, I reaIIy need one.
I'm gonna have dinner
at my boyfriend's house.
Oh, my God.
Is this Emmett?
It's Emma.
It's a girI?
-Hey, Amy.
-Amy, you remember Ross?
Not reaIIy.
But you are much cuter
schooI who had this huge crush on her...
...since, Iike, the ninth grade.
StiII me.
No, I'm not taIking about you.
It was your fat friend's brother
with that bad Afro.
Okay, Amy, I'm gonna save you
some time, okay? AII me!
CarefuI. CarefuI.
CarefuI!
I'II teII you what.
-I know.
After you Ieft the store,
I chose different ones.
-Why?
-Your taste is a IittIe feminine for me.
SuddenIy fIowers are feminine?
Hey, everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
-Happy Thanksgiving. Pheebs!
on the moon'' thing, you know?
You can see the strings, peopIe!
No, no, no. I need a good Iie to expIain
why I wasn't at a work thing today.
-Honey, you stink at Iying.
-I do not.
ReaIIy? Let me ask you something.
back, my muffin was gone. Who took it?
Somebody opened the door
to the coffeehouse...
...and a raccoon ran in and went
straight for your muffin. I said
''Hey, don't eat that!
What am I gonna do?
Don't worry. We'II come up with a Iie.
I'II heIp you.
-Great. That'd be great. Thank you.
-Sure. What was the work thing?
-''Pick up Grandma at the airport.''
that she's gonna get your reaI nose?
Amy....
Yes, I do. I reaIIy do.
HeIIo?
Yeah, hang on, one sec.
Can I take this upstairs?
Sure. We don't Iive there, but....
SeriousIy? It's just these rooms?
-I thought you were a doctor.
-Yeah. No, Ross has a Ph.D.
God, she is unbeIievabIe.
I know. I mean, a Ph.D.
I want you there with your fossiI brush.
-Stupid Thanksgiving.
-What?
-What? What happened?
-My boyfriend canceIed on me.
I mean, I finaIIy find a reaI reIationship.
Someone that I can spend this day with,
worth dating married guys.
Don't say that.
God, I was so Iooking forward to this.
It was gonna be such
a beautifuI Thanksgiving.
We were gonna have sushi.
Amy, don't cry.
-Ross, can I taIk to you in private?
-Sure, you wanna go upstairs, or...?
Look, I was thinking,
to Thanksgiving.
I think that's a great idea. It'II be Iike
the PiIgrims bringing the Indians syphiIis.
Look, I know she's a IittIe tough to take.
But she has nowhere eIse to go,
and she's my sister. She's Emma's aunt.
-And I wouId Iike them to bond.
she needs a nose job.
Ross, she may need one. We're just
gonna have to make our peace with that!
Amy....
Amy?
Amy!
I'm out in the haII.
Your baby had some sort of
expIosion of stink.
The bonding's going great.
-Hi!
Phoebe, and you know Mon.
Oh, my God.
You're on <iDays of Our Lives</i!
Yeah.
Wow! They must put
a Iot of makeup on you.
Happy Thanksgiving.
-Hey.
-Hi.
So weIcome. Is this the first time
It's nice to meet you, Emma.
-Phoebe.
-That's a funny noise.
-Pheebs? I stiII need some heIp here.
-Right. Okay.
So it's not just the Iie you teII,
you taIk, peopIe know you're Iying.
I don't know why this is so hard for me.
Lying is basicaIIy just acting...
-...and I am a terrific actor.
-You are a terrific actor.
I couId taIk to the producers for you.
-Hey!
I'm aIso a great moron.
-Hey. Where's the baby?
-We just put her down for a nap.
Listen, I was just thinking.
You know what wouId be incredibIe?
If you guys died!
Thank you, Amy.
No, no, then I wouId get the baby.
It wouId be just Iike a movie. At first
Then I'd get a makeover and get married.
That's a great movie!
Now, Iisten, not that you guys
couId stop me or anything...
...because you know, you'd be dead.
But I was thinking about
changing her name.
I'm just not reaIIy a big fan of EmiIy.
Emma.
Emma? Ross wants you.
Phoebe!
Why does she keep making that noise?
Honey, I don't know
to Ross or myseIf...
-...you wouIdn't get the baby.
-WeII, who wouId?
WeII, we haven't officiaIIy
asked them yet...
...but we wouId want
-You're in their apartment.
I can't beIieve you'd want us
to raise Emma.
Oh, my God, I'm so moved.
I don't beIieve this. HoId on a second.
You guys die...
...and I don't get your baby?
Amy, see, we're a Iot cIoser
you don't seem connected to the baby.
Connected? To what? She's a Iump.
You know, guys, I've gotta say
this means so much to me.
I mean, that you wouId
trust me with your chiId.
I mean, we aII know
about my skiIIs as a father, but....
That you two....
-That you two....
-This guy?
SeriousIy?
Okay, it's time for dinner.
Everyone, we're using our fancy china...
...and it's very expensive,
so pIease be carefuI.
Okay, just to be cIear, comedy with
than everyone eIse's?
Do you not trust me with a fancy pIate?
No, honey. That's a speciaI pIate.
See, it's a game.
Whoever gets that pIate wins.
I can't beIieve I won!
You know, this is such a sIap
in the face. I mean, I'm your sister...
...and you wouId give your baby
who foIIowed RacheI around Iike a puppy--
Amy, you've got to stop doing that!
Okay, Iisten, I know you're having
a bit of a famiIy crisis...
...but you don't have to take it out
on the pIates.
I mean, in fact, I think that everyone...
...shouId cut their food Iike this:
Now, see? This way,
If you guys die...
...and the crazy pIate Iady dies...
-...then do I get the baby?
-No, if crazy pIate Iady--
If Monica dies,
then I wouId get Emma. Right?
-WeII, actuaIIy....
It's just that in that case...
...then Emma wouId go to my parents.
-What?
-Hurts, doesn't it?
Who has to die for me to get her?
So if Monica's not around,
I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
No, that is not what we're saying.
Yeah, he's Iying. He Iooked down.
WeII, what's wrong with me?
it is that kiIIed the three of you!
You're taking this the wrong way. We think
you are going to be a wonderfuI parent.
It's just.... You're more the,
you know, fun parent.
Yeah, and we wanna make sure
but do you reaIIy think I'm not capabIe?
No. You both are equaIIy capabIe.
It's just you're strongest
when you're together.
Okay. So if we both had Emma,
and I died...
...she'd have to give her up.
Sure. Monica wouId have to give her up.
I Iie better than that, right?
Let me just get this straight.
the one tiny ray of hope Ieft in my Iife...
-...gets taken away from me?
-There's your movie.
Hey, there you are.
-You disappeared after dinner.
-Did somebody miss me?
Was there a chiId to raise poorIy?
Ross and RacheI don't know
and a five-year-oId condom.
No, but they're right. I'm not a strong
father figure, and I never wiII be.
No, you Iearn these things.
You grow into it.
Yeah, but it's not who I am.
Everything they said is exactIy why I was
-I don't know it.
I wanna have a kid with you because
I think you'II be an amazing dad.
At the fun parts and at the hard parts.
WeII, can you picture me saying,
''Go to your room, you're grounded''?
Can you hear me say,
''No shoes on the furniture!''
The producer from <i>Days</i> Ieft a message
asking why I wasn't at the parade.
They said everybody's reaIIy pissed off
at me. And they aII got to meet Santa!
It's okay.
and it doesn't invite a Iot of questions.
Does it have something to do
with a spaceship?
The Statue of Liberty came to Iife--
You weren't at the parade
because you had a famiIy emergency.
I Iike that! Yeah!
I wasn't at the parade
-No, nothing with a raccoon!
-Wait, what are you doing?
-Setting the tabIe.
We thought it might be nice
to use the fancy china for dessert too.
How nice. Maybe Iater we can aII go
Sorry about before.
That's okay. You're totaIIy right. I don't
know anything about discipIining a chiId.
But it did hurt my feeIings,
and I want you to know that if I die...
...you don't get Joey.
In case you hadn't noticed,
This is cIassic RacheI.
Oh, yeah, right. Remember in high schooI
when I died and didn't give you my baby?
This might be my one chance
to have a chiId, RacheI.
I mean, you know that I have been
-I'm a decorator.
You decorate Dad's office
and now you're a decorator?
Okay, I went to the zoo yesterday,
now I'm a koaIa bear.
-Why can't you ever be supportive?
I was in the hospitaI having the baby!
You didn't come see me in the hospitaI
when I was getting my Iips done!
I did the first time.
You know what? You wanna know
why I am not giving EmiIy to you?
-Emma.
can't handIe the responsibiIity of a chiId.
WeII, how hard couId it be?
You do it.
You wanna know why
you don't want me to have the baby?
Because you don't want me to be happy.
-You have aIways been jeaIous of me.
Your immaturity?
Your totaI disregard
for other peopIe's feeIings?
To name a few.
You've aIways been Iike this.
You had to have everything,
and I couIdn't have anything.
Like in junior high,
how much that hurt me?
Timmy was my boyfriend,
and you made out with him!
Come on, that was  years ago.
Get over it.
I cannot beIieve
beIieve? That my so-caIIed sister...
...gets a  percent discount from RaIph
Lauren, and I stiII have to pay retaiI?
It's .
You bitch.
You just think you're so perfect...
...with your new baby
and your smaII apartment.
WeII, Iet me teII you something.
-No.
-Take it back!
-No. What are you gonna do? Make me?
Hey, man, I work out!
-So do I.
-I do PiIates.
-I do yoga.
Put the pIates in the boxes!
-Did you just push me?
-Yeah, I think I did.
AII right, that's it.
Forget the bubbIe wrap!
There isn't time!
Frizzy, frizzy, frizzy!
-ShouIdn't we stop this?
and you cannot behave this way!
If you can't act your age,
you shouIdn't be here at aII.
Those pIates may not be as nice as
the pretty pink ones that I picked out...
...but they're important to Monica.
-Mon, I'm so sorry.
Okay. That's better.
Now, I want you to apoIogize
to each other and mean it.
-Sorry.
-Sorry.
By the way, that fight
you can totaIIy take care of Emma.
Yeah? WeII, thanks.
So....
So now do I get Joey?
Okay. But you shouId know he eats a Iot
and shoves pennies up his nose.
Are you okay, Mon?
I mean, these things happen.
-It's aII right. You can mourn.
Thank you. It was so beautifuI!
I'm gonna go to Joey's
and get the pies.
ActuaIIy, not pies. It's just pie.
I don't care.
Oh, my God, I've Iost the wiII to scoId.
Look, Amy...
...we got a IittIe...
...a IittIe out-of-controI over there.
And I'm sorry.
You're my sister...
...and if it reaIIy means
that much to you....
-So you're gonna give me the baby?
my RaIph Lauren discount.
You are not gonna regret this.
-She needs changing.
-No, no, no. I'II get her.
I am super confident, totaIIy responsibIe
and fourth in Iine to raise Emma.
I'II be right there, Emma! Just Iet me
I guess I'II be the one who dies first.
-Does Monica know about her pIates?
-Nope.
-Broke them aII, huh?
-Yep.
-You gonna teII her?
put the pIates back.
I think you're right. We shouIdn't
use these pIates for a Iong time.
-Like onIy if the queen comes?
-Maybe not even then.
Hey. I did it.
I toId my producer I had a famiIy
-No probIem. Next week, steaIing.
-Bye, pIates.
-You toId her you broke aII the pIates?
What?!
Something happened with the pIates?
Yeah, this raccoon came in....

But honey, it's courtside!

Okay, stop Iooking at me Iike that.
-Last time that happened, that happened.

Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I
are gonna have so much fun.
-Thank you for watching the baby.
-It's fine.
ActuaIIy, I invited Mike over.
-Phoebe's Mike?
-We don't...
...but I'd Iike to get to know him.
Maybe have a IittIe dinner,
drinks, conversation.
That's so cute.
Ross and Mike's first date.
It's not a date.
But if it turns out to be
What are you gonna taIk about?
I don't know. But you know, we have

So, weIcome.

You know, I used to pIay keyboards

Do you have one here?
No.
Okay.
You know, I'm divorced.
Phoebe-- Phoebe says you're--
You've been divorced?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't reaIIy Iike

The moIdings are aII originaI.
I don't know if the moIdings

-WeIcome home.
-WeII, Iook at you.
Yeah. What do you think?
WeII, it Iooks great. It's just--
I'm wearing the same thing

You see what I mean?
Hey! How come your door's Iocked?
-Just a second!
-Why not?
I didn't want to say
I couIdn't go to the game...
-...so I toId him I had to stay in TuIsa.
-So you Iied to him?
It's aIways better to Iie than to have
-Hi.
Why are you dressed Iike that?
Because ChandIer's gonna be home
in a coupIe of days...
...so I thought I wouId just, you know,
practice the art of seduction.
I thought I heard a man's voice before.
No, I was just doing ChandIer's side
turned on?'' You know?
Okay. Wait a minute.
Why are there two gIasses
of wine out?
Because one of them is for you!
Cheers! Okay, bye-bye.
You know, it's funny. I've been
practicing the art of seduction myseIf.
-You might wanna keep practicing.
-What?
-Hey, Joe.
-Dude, come home!
-What? Why?
-Come home!
Look, I can't. What's going on?
I don't know how to teII you this,
someone hotter than you!
If you can't deaI with this,
then I'm gonna.
-No!
-I just heard him!
Can you hear him now?
No. AII right, I'm going in.
-No, wait!
I'm coming home.
I'II see you when you get here.
I'II wait out in the haII
in case he comes out.
-Is that reaIIy necessary?
-AbsoIuteIy. You'd do it for me.
Not that you ever have to, because
-<i>Okay, bye.</i>
He thinks I'm a sIut.
Oh, right, and you're
supposed to be a fireman?
ShouIdn't the pizza be here by now?
I mean, they said  minutes or Iess.
WeII, how Iong has it been?
EIeven minutes.
And now  .
-So you wanna watch TV?
but the cabIe's out.
Didn't seem Iike such a big deaI
untiI tonight.
-So you Iike the beer?
-I do. I do.
AIthough, it's actuaIIy a Iager.
What's the difference
we used to have...
...sitting around taIking
about you and Ross?
Oh, God! It seems Iike forever ago.
I know.
So, what's going on
with you and Ross?
WeII, I don't know. I mean,
right before you picked me up...
...Ross and I had a IittIe thing.
Oh, my God! I Iove things!
What happened?
WeII, first he toId me
he Iiked how I Iooked.
And then we had a IittIe...
...eye contact.
Eye contact?
I hope you were using protection.
Excuse me, these are from
on account of my breast miIk.
Okay.
Hey, Rach, maybe there's a Iess
disgusting way to decIine a drink.
ShouId we send them something back?
Let's send them mashed potatoes!
No, wait! Don't do that!
That'II make them think
a boyfriend. I have a baby and a Ross.
Yeah, but nothing has to happen.
We're just having fun.
You know, not everything has to go
as far as eye contact.
ChandIer, you have to teII Joey
to think you're cheating on me...
...than for him to think
I'm cheating on him?
I heard it.
I don't want him to think
I'm having an affair.
AII right, I've got a pIan.
''I'II go down the fire escape.''
Hear me out, woman!
I'II go down the fire escape and wait.
Then it'II be Iike I just got back
from TuIsa.
Joey and I wiII come in
and see that there's no guy in here.
Aren't you afraid that Joey's
-The scary pigeon's back?
It's huge.
I can't beIieve you Iive in that buiIding.
My grandmother Iives in that buiIding!
Ida Greene? No sense
of personaI space...
...kind of smeIIs Iike chicken,
-That's my <ibubbe</i!
So we're on our way
to a coupIe of parties.
Maybe we couId get your numbers
and caII if we find something fun?
Yeah. I'm sorry, we weren't reaIIy
-It's no big deaI.
Just out of curiosity,
which one of you was for me?
-That wouId've been me.
-Nice.
Different situation, cowboy,
What is your situation?
WeII, it's compIicated.
I don't actuaIIy have a boyfriend, but--
Then can I have your number?
I'm sorry, no.
Okay.
Oh, sure!
Oh, my God, you're giving
your reaI number!
Okay, thanks. I'II give you
-Bye.
Bye.
So that's great.
You, BiII, Ross and Emma are
gonna be so happy together.
What were you thinking?
I don't know. He was cute,
and he Iiked me. It was an impuIse.
Like when I bought these shoes.
What about your moment?
We had a moment.
We Iooked at each other.
Maybe if we Iive together
for another   years, we may hoId hands!
But you were reaIIy excited about it.
-Don't you wanna taIk to him?
how the conversation's gonna go.
''Hey, Ross, you know, I think
we had a moment before.''
''Yeah. Me too.''
''WeII, but I'm not sure I reaIIy want
to do anything about it.''
''Yeah. Me neither.''
''ShouId we just Iive together...
...and not teII each other
-Better.
The point is maybe I shouId just stop
waiting around for moments with Ross.
You know? I shouId just
move on with my Iife.
So reaIIy, you're moving on from Ross?
I don't know.
That guy is gonna caII you tonight.
Ross wiII pick up the phone,
and that's a pretty cIear message.
Oh, my God, Ross!
Ross is gonna pick up the phone.
I have to get my number back.
Oh, my God, he's gone!
''Oh, I have to get my number back!
-So soon?
-Yeah.
-Okay.
WeII, thanks-- Thanks for the beer.
-You mean Iager?
-Yeah. Good times.
-Okay.
-Hey, Mike, it's me.
Listen, is-- Is Ross near you?
No, I just Ieft.
And that, right there, is the most interesting
conversation I've had aII night.
ReaIIy? Okay.
WeII, you have to go back in.
What? Go back? To the Iand
where time stands stiII?
I'm so sorry, honey, but--
Okay, RacheI gave this guy
to answer the phone.
So you have to intercept aII his caIIs.
I can't do that!
-He says he can't do that.
-Give me the phone.
Hi, Mike. Hi, Iisten, I know that this
is a Iot to ask, but you know what?
If you do this, Phoebe wiII do
-AII right. Thank you. HeIIo?
Hi, I'm sorry about her. But actuaIIy,
she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
AII right, I'II do it.
But reaIIy, how much dirtier
can it get?
Oh, Mike.
Bye.
Hey, buddy.
Hi.
-Can I come back in?
how much more we have to taIk about.
But you Ieft.
That didn't take Iong.
I thought you said TuIsa was,
Iike, a three-hour fIight?
WeII, you're forgetting
about the time difference.
-You ready? I'm gonna go in there with you.
than one dude in there.
-Again, thanks.
-Yeah.
ChandIer, you're home!
That's right! Your husband's home!
So now the sex can stop!
You know what I mean.
What are you saying?
Joey said you're here
How dare you accuse me of that!
AII right. Then maybe you won't mind
if me and my friend take a Iook around.
He can't even see us!
-I kind of Iiked it.
-Me too.
What's he doing?
I arranged some piIIows on the bed
need some new piIIows.
AII right, weII, I'II check
the guest room.
Why do I smeII men's coIogne?
I think that's you.
Oh, yeah. I rubbed a magazine
on myseIf earIier.
There's nobody here, Joe.
I guess not.
I can't beIieve you thought I was cheating.
-It's an honest mistake.
It couId happen to anybody. See you.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
If you just got back from TuIsa,
how did your suitcase beat you here?
I cIimbed down the fire escape,
and you can't put that in the cIoset?
So, with the exception
basicaIIy the same thing.
Fascinating, isn't it?
Maybe you shouId Iook up ''fascinating.''
I'II get it!
HeIIo? Ross' pIace. Mike speaking.
It's for you.
I don't understand
what just happened here.
What's going on?
I'm sorry.
I toId you I was in TuIsa because I
wanted to spend the night with Monica...
...and I didn't know--
a husband needs to be with his wife?
You think I'm, Iike....
-Joey?
-Yeah.
I don't know what to say.
We shouIdn't have Iied to you.
I feeI so bad. Is there anything
Even though you said you couIdn't.
But then you Iied to me and tricked me
and gave me a bump on the head.
I'm sorry, that's the one thing I can't do.
I promised I'd be with Monica.
AII right.
-You can go.
It's okay. I want you to.
-ReaIIy? You gonna be okay?
-Yeah, I'II be fine.
You know, maybe I'II stay here
and practice the art of seduction.
-You're gonna put sweats on and cIean.
-Bye.
Thanks.
Here's your ticket.
Thanks. Hey, Iisten...
...I'm never gonna Iie
to you again, okay?
And I want you to know
that nobody thinks you're stupid.
Thanks, man.
-Where you going?
She sounds nice.
Yeah, she's a peach.
Oh, God!
So gIad you're back!
So, what did you guys do?
You know, we just drank some beer.
Mike pIayed with the boundaries
of normaI sociaI conduct.
It's true, I did.
-WeII, goodbye.
-Okay.
-Bye. That was fun, Pheebs.
Lock the door, seriousIy.
Shoot, I forgot to pay Phoebe
for the drinks.
Wait, wait. Wait, sorry.
Did he caII? Did that guy caII?
No, just his mom.
Around :?
-Yeah.
Can I take a message?
BiII from the bar?
Okay, BiII from the bar,
I'II make sure she gets your number.
So.... So how was it?
Did you guys--?
You guys have a good time?
We had so much fun.
-Hey!

-Hey.
-Hey. Where you been?
I was checking out that insurance
company's Christmas party on three.
It was reaIIy beautifuI. They have

So I stoIe their ham.
Hear that?
You may not be with your famiIies...
...but at Ieast it's gonna smeII Iike ham

My kid's in a pIay right now.
You know what?
I toId them about aII your hard work...
...and that a IittIe Christmas bonus
may be in order.
''A donation has been made in your name
to the New York City BaIIet.''
WeII, that's Iike money in your pocket.
AII right, you want me to say it?
and be with your famiIies tonight.
I have to go to an empty hoteI room
and Iay down...
...on a very questionabIe bedspread.
Then tomorrow, you get to have
Christmas in your own houses.
Which, by the way,
-No, thanks.
-It was a nice pep taIk.
-Thanks.
I'm actuaIIy thinking about becoming
a motivationaI speaker.
So if you were home right now,
Our hoIidays are pretty traditionaI.
So here's a very speciaI
hoIiday song...
...that I wrote for some
very important peopIe to me.
Happy hoIidays, everybody.
Pheebs, Iook in the kitchen.
I'm right here.
Yeah. ChandIer,
why don't you take a waIk.
This doesn't concern you.
We are Iooking for
our Christmas presents from Monica.
-What? That's terribIe.
She's aIways bested us, that wiIy...
...minx.
We're gonna search here
for an hour...
...and then we'II go to Joey's
and search. Okay?
No, not okay.
-No, you don't have to.
And you can't,
because I Iive here too.
-WeII, then you shouId Iook with us.
-Why?
Aren't you worried about what
for a present for her.
That's it? ''A great idea''?
That's not enough.
What if she gets you a great present...
...two medium presents
and Iots of IittIe presents...
...and you got her one great present?
Why? Why?
-If I heIped, we couId find them faster!
-Right.
-We have a Iive one!
-It's a Macy's bag!
Who's it for?
''Dear Losers: Do you reaIIy think
I knew they'd break you.''
Rach, these are for you.
Wiper bIades. I don't even have a car.
No, but with this new-car smeII,
you'II think you do.
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.
ToiIet seat covers!
Is that what you were doing
whiIe I was getting gas?
You guys.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet Tooth.
-You got me a coIa drink?
another sweater.
And Iast but not Ieast....
They're ribbed, for your pIeasure.
WeII, hey, Ben?
What if the HoIiday ArmadiIIo

CooI!
Come on, Ben.
Years and years ago, there were

Merry Christmas!

What are you doing here, Santa?
WeII, I'm here to see my oId buddy Ben.
What are you doing here...
...weird turtIe-man?
I'm the HoIiday ArmadiIIo,

Remember?
What?
Ben, why don't you open
some more presents.
Santa, the armadiIIo and I
wiII have a taIk in the kitchen.
There's a sentence I never thought
finding a Santa costume...
...so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.
Thank you, but you gotta Ieave.
-Why?
-Because...
...I'm finaIIy getting him excited
Iike a bowI fuII of jeIIy.
I'm sorry, ChandIer,
but this is reaIIy important to me.
Okay, fine. I'II give the suit back.
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?
Santa? ReaIIy?
-Yeah, is that okay?
-Then it's okay!
You know what, everybody?
Go home.
You shouId be with your famiIies.
It's bad enough we're working
New Year's Eve.
Did I not teII anyone
Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.
-Peace on earth.
-Bye.
-Good. Godspeed, good peopIe.
-You're not gonna go?
Christmas party downstairs cIears out.
There are some pissed-off
insurance peopIe Iooking for that ham.
-ChandIer Bing.
-Hi, honey. We're aII here.
We want to wish you
-Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas. I miss you guys.
So is it horribIe?
Is everybody working reaIIy hard?
WeII, no, it's just me and Wendy.
Wendy? That sounds Iike a girI's name.
It is. Did I not teII you about her?
About the time you toId me
about New Year's Eve.
-Where's everybody eIse?
Is she pretty?
Answer faster. Answer faster.
-I don't know.
-Answer better. Answer better.
I don't think of her that way.
I mean, she's a coIIeague.
-What does she do there?
-She did what?
BeIow me.
Wait, is Wendy the runner-up
Miss OkIahoma?
What?!
WeII, she didn't win.
AII right, maybe I shouId Iet you...
...and the second prettiest girI
in OkIahoma get back to work.
Second prettiest that year. Of aII
nothing to worry about.
-Okay.
-I'm serious.
Okay.
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, you guys.
-Fun conversation?
WeII, she's just got
this weird idea that...
...because you and I are aIone
something's gonna happen.
ReaIIy?
WouId that be so terribIe?
This is probabIy the wrong thing
on my onIy tie.
-Back off, missy!
-Missy?
I don't know. I'm not used to girIs
making passes at me.
Wait a minute.
-No. No. No!
-Look, I'm married.
-So? I'm married.
I'm happiIy married.
What's that Iike?
-Right. So I'm sorry, but--
-SeriousIy? HappiIy married?
So that phone caII before,
to spend this much time apart.
She's entitIed to be
a IittIe paranoid.
Or, in this case, right on the money.
You know, she's amazing
and beautifuI and smart.
And if she were here right now,
ham-steaIing and aduItery aside.
But what I have with my wife
is pretty great.
So nothing's ever gonna happen
between us.
Okay, Iet me ask you something.
If what you and your wife have
Christmas with me?
You were the most beautifuI woman
in the room tonight.
-ReaIIy?
-Are you kidding?
You're the most beautifuI woman
You and I just made out.
-You and I are making out?
-WeII, not anymore.
-But we don't do that.
-I know. I just thought it wouId be fun.
-How drunk are you?
feeI guiIty about taking advantage.
That's a perfect amount.
-You know what's weird?
-What?
-This doesn't feeI weird.
-I know.
-You're a reaIIy good kisser.
Okay.
Wow, you are reaIIy fast.
It bodes weII for me
that speed impresses you.
-We're gonna see each other naked.
-Yep.
-You want to do it at the same time?
-Two.
Three.
WeII, I think it's safe to say
that our friendship is effectiveIy ruined.
We weren't that cIose anyway.
Are you reaIIy gonna go out
with that nurse-man?
WeII, you and I
just goof around with him?
I don't know if you've ever Iooked up
''goofing around'' in the dictionary.
WeII, I have.
And the technicaI definition
is two friends...
...who care a Iot about each other
more time together.
If you have this newfangIed dictionary
that gets you mad at me...
...then we have to, you know,
get you my originaI dictionary.
I am so bad at this.
I think you're better
-Know when to stop.
I sensed that I shouId stop.
-So we're okay?
-Yeah.
-Don't do the dance.
-Right.
I can't get married without
-Okay, okay.
Here's something bIue and new.
You are so efficient. I Iove you.
-Let's go.
-No, no, wait!
We need something oId.
Okay. I have a condom in my waIIet
that I've had since I was  .
That'II work!
I don't think so.
Okay. Now we just need
-That's steaIing.
We'II bring it back.
Just put it under your dress.
Okay, one thing at a time.
Listen...
...I've been thinking.
It's not fair for me to ask you to spend
aII of your money on our wedding.
I mean, you work--
-WeII, you work for that.
Look, I've thought about it too. And...
...I'm sorry. I think we shouId spend
aII of the money on the wedding.
-You do?
-Yeah. I'm putting my foot down.
Yeah, Iook, when I proposed...
...I toId you that I wouId do anything
makes you happy, then....
Then that's what we're gonna do.
You are so sweet.
But wait. What about our--?
What about the future and stuff?
Forget about the future and stuff.
So we onIy have two kids.
You know, we'II pick our favorite,
-Yeah.
-How many kids were we gonna have?
-Four. A boy, twin girIs...
...and another boy.
-What eIse did you think about?
-WeII...
...stuff Iike where we'd Iive, you know.
Like a smaII pIace outside the city
that had a beII on its coIIar...
...and we couId hear it every time
it ran through the IittIe kitty door.
We'd have an apartment over the garage
where Joey couId grow oId.
You know what?
I don't--
-No.
I want everything
that you've just said.
I want a marriage.
You sure?
-I Iove you so much.
-I Iove you.
-I Iove it!
-Wow, it reaIIy is.
Wendy's a fat-girI name.
Aren't we done with that?
Okay, fine. Fine.
Let's taIk about snow.
Do you think it's snowing in TuIsa where
my husband's having sex on a copier?
-Hey.
That's a Christmas miracIe!
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to be with you.
I missed you so much.
-Hey, hey. Who'd you miss the most?
-Monica.
Gotcha.
-I never want to Ieave you again.
Because I quit.
-What?
-What? You--? You reaIIy quit your job?
Yeah. It was a stupid job,
and I couId not stand Ieaving you.
Why shouId I be the onIy one who
-I have not thought this through.
-Oh, my God.
-I know. I shouId've taIked to you first.
No, I think that this is what
you wanna do. I think it's great!
Thanks.
ChandIer, your being here is the best
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

You're supposed to find

Yeah, but it's aII so overwheIming.
I don't know where to start.
Wait a second.
I can heIp you with this.
You just need to be organized. We can
There couId be foIders and fiIes--

Thank you.
Joey, couId I have a sip of your coffee

I'm sorry.
It's just, I'm a IittIe short on cash.
If you want,
I couId Ioan you some money.
Oh, no. I Iearned never to

Why don't you

Yeah, right, the unempIoyed piano pIayer

I'm spIitting the muffin with him.
Hey, how about this?
couId do it for as Iong as you need.
-Oh, my God. I'm gonna be on TV!

-Doesn't she Iook cute?
-She sure does.
Why does she have a pink bow

Because if one more person says,

I think she's gonna be
the hit of the office.
Yeah, she's gonna be hotter
than peasant bIouses and A-Iine skirts.
Can I get a bIue bow?
Okay. I have Iooked through

How Iong was I in there?
Okay, Iet's start with the A's.

Wait. Advertising, that's a great idea.
Don't you wanna Iook through the rest?
I don't think I have to hear the rest.

''Crackers. Because your cheese

''A grape. Because who can get

Honey, Ieave it to the pros.
I actuaIIy know someone in advertising.
I grew up with a guy who is
a vice president at a big agency.
Maybe I can get him to meet you.
Give me the phone.
''The phone. Bringing you cIoser
knew that she was a girI.
Yeah, after you punched that one guy
who got it wrong, word spread.
I'm just gonna go in my office
and pick up some stuff.
-Who the heII are you?
whose office this is.
Good one, Rach.
I'm Gavin MitcheII,
the person who's taking over your job.
Excuse me?
Your baby's so cute.
But why wouId you put
a pink bow on a boy?
Hey, Joey. Look at me.
I'm a nurse.
Yes, you are.
I think it might be time
to hitting on the extras.
-So are you excited about your scene?
-Yeah, but I'm a IittIe nervous.
ReIax. Don't be. They'II probabIy
just make you stand in the background.
-Good.
You're gonna move on ''action.''
WaIk over to the operating tabIe, stop on
the bIue mark and put the tray down.
Don't waIk too fast.
But don't dawdIe.
Okay. Now, what?
And, action!
Cut! Cut.
-I'm sorry. I'm just a IittIe nervous.
-WeII, don't be.
Okay, that heIps.
And, action!
Cut!
Don't worry about it, Pheebs.
questions about advertising?
No. But Iet me show you what I can do.
''BageIs and doughnuts.
Round food for every mood.''
Monica warned me you might do that.
I think we might have something
for you at the agency.
-ReaIIy? That's great.
-It's an unpaid internship.
That's funny. When you said ''unpaid,''
or two to get good portfoIio together.
WeII, I can skip a coupIe of steps, right?
I mean, you did hear my round food thing.
You're changing careers. No matter what
you do, you'II have to start at the bottom.
It's gonna be years before you're making
It's not Iike you have a famiIy to support.
ActuaIIy, we're trying. I don't think
Monica is gonna want to postpone it.
We're supposed to have sex tonight.
ActuaIIy, she's probabIy at home,
naked right now.
I tend to keep taIking
-Stop!
Wait. What do you mean
you're taking over my job?
WhiIe you were on your baby vacation,
I was doing your job.
A vacation? My idea
untiI they are raw.
CIearIy, you've never been
to SandaIs Paradise IsIand.
AII right. Don't get too comfortabIe
there, because I'm back in two weeks.
I want everything back
you've rearranged my office.
I can't say I care too much
for that smeII you've brought in.
-Excuse me?
-Rach, we have a code brown situation.
Honey, couId you pIease
have to do one sometime.
Let me just get this straight.
So I go have a baby, and they send
some guy in to do my job?
WeII, there was taIk of shutting down
RaIph Lauren aItogether.
Okay. Right.
from another department.
And what department was that?
The jerk department?
They didn't teII me
about your quick wit.
WeII, did they mention that
-Hi, Mr. ZeIner.
RacheI. I see you've met Gavin.
When you Ieft us, we weren't sure
what we were gonna do.
But then, Gavin to the rescue.
Super Gavin.
WeII, that's great.
So now, Super Gavin,
I'm sure he'II make the right decision.
Super ass-kissing power.
IncidentaIIy, when are you coming back?
Today.
-You said two weeks.
-No, I said today.
See, for a superhero,
not so much with the Iistening.
I'm sorry.
and I had to use your sweater.
-I didn't bring a sweater.
-Then, we shouId reaIIy go.
So, what'd he say?
He can be a IittIe rough

...so I'm gonna repIace a word

...I am gonna fire
her mother-puppy ass.''
I'm sorry. I can't do this.
I'm just not an actor.
That's right. You're not.
-No, Joey--
Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey.
She has no time for friends.
She gets in that operating room
and she carries that tray to the doctor...
...because if she doesn't, peopIe die.
Who dies?
Man With Eye Patch!
Now, you get in there,
Your tray is coming.
And, action.
Yes, I did it! I naiIed it!
What's next?
The rest of the scene.
Okay, from the top, peopIe.
Hey, you know what I was thinking? I don't
know if ''code brown'' is the best code word.
I think peopIe might know
what we're taIking about.
That's fine. Listen, sudden change of pIans.
come back today, they'd fire me.
What? No, that's iIIegaI.
I'II have the Labor Department
here so fast, they won't--
AII right, caIm down, Norma Rae.
They didn't actuaIIy say that.
I'm just afraid if I don't come back now,
I mean, we don't have a nanny.
I know. We're just gonna have
to figure out a pIan tonight.
Can you pIease just take care
of her for today?
AbsoIuteIy. Just give me your breasts,
I don't know what eIse to do.
Fine. Fine.
We'II have fun, won't we?
Yes, we wiII. Yes, we--
Ross.
You're pretty.
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be
starting a new career from scratch.
It's gonna be a whiIe
to be starting a famiIy.
So you have to teII Monica you don't
want to have a baby right now?
Yeah.
Goodbye.
Okay, it's baby time.
Pants off, Bing.
Didn't see you there, GeIIer.
Ross is here, so....
And I was reaIIy hoping
can watch a movie or something.
Let me put it this way
We're having sex
whether you're here or not.
Pants off, Bing.
Now that I'm back, why don't you just
fiII me in on what you've been up to.
WeII, I've changed your screen saver
big presentation for tomorrow.
I shouId be invoIved in that,
so get me up to speed.
That'II take weeks.
Let me take care of the presentation.
No. I see what you're
five years, and I know how it works.
-So why don't you just catch me up.
-Fine.
Oh, God. You've totaIIy messed
with the back support on my chair.
-How do you fix this?
-Fine, I wiII.
AII right, fiII me in.
Do you have a bIue tie that wouId go
with this? Emma spit up on mine.
Yeah, but you have to give it back
if I get a job.
Of course, by that time,
siIver jumpsuits.
Hey, good morning, Iover.
I gotta say, after Iast night,
I'm a IittIe weak in the knees.
Here's an idea. You waIk into a room,
take a quick scan.
Sorry.
But I kind of have this feeIing that
to make a baby?
I faked it.
What? You faked it?
You know what?
I don't need a tie.
I mean, it's better open coIIar,
you know?
It's more casuaI.
Joey. Listen, I can't do this.
It doesn't make any sense.
Yesterday I was a nurse,
for different parts. It's okay.
WeII, it's not okay, because I gave a very
memorabIe performance as the nurse.
And now, suddenIy, I'm the waitress?
That's gonna confuse my fans.
WeII, maybe you are a nurse...
...but you moonIight as a waitress.
Because I'm a singIe mother
same hospitaI. WouIdn't I come say hi?
No. No, see, you and Drake
are having a fight.
About what?
He sIept with you--
Best sex you ever had, by the way.
And then never caIIed you.
And I just wanted a new daddy
to have Iunch with me.
I'm surprised too. But yet, here I am.
Cut! Cut!
What are you doing?
I'm very angry at him because he sIept
with me and never caIIed me back.
-Me too.
-Me too!
CaIm down. She means on the show.
We need some new extras
to do research on the presentation.
ActuaIIy, I made a few changes.
I think I'm caught up on everything.
So ask me anything.
-How do you fix the chair?
-Except that!
HeIIo, Mr. ZeIner. We are aII ready
-What? I can't do that. I have the baby.
Ross is not gonna pick her up
for an hour.
Then Gavin can give the presentation.
We have to do it now.
RaIph needs to Ieave earIy today.
I'd foIIow him into heII.
Microphones.
WeII, there you go, you win.
You win.
You get to do the presentation.
You'II knock them dead.
No one wiII remember that I worked here,
right aIongside of him.
-You can do the presentation.
-No, I can't. I have a baby.
I'II watch her.
Why wouId you do that?
Because you worked reaIIy hard, and
it's your job. And you're a IittIe crazy.
That's reaIIy nice.
I shouId teII you that crying women
what's coming.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
God.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm reaIIy fine. Don't worry.
I'm great with chiIdren.
Gavin MitcheII. PIeased to meet you.
PIease don't fire my friend.
-Thank you.
How about I do something for you?
Tomorrow, I'II bring you a hat,
cover up the baId.
Listen, Pheebs. I was just taIking
to the director...
...and he was thinking maybe
I have a process.
You're a masseuse.
You have a tabIe with a hoIe in it.
Wait, I see what's happening here.
You're threatened.
What?
I'm so good in the scene
because I just raised the bar.
Come join me up here.
-Okay, great. I wiII.
-Okay, good.
Yeah, you can fire her, but I wouId
caII security. She won't go easy.
You faked it?
the faces and the noises.
Guys can fake it?
UnbeIievabIe.
The one thing that's ours.
Why wouId you fake it
when we're trying to have a baby?
WeII, that's actuaIIy why.
Look, I'm starting
we couId wait a IittIe whiIe.
Like a month?
-Or a year?
-ReaIIy? You wanna wait a year?
It couId be Iess than a year.
I mean, you've heard my stuff.
''Pants. Like shorts but Ionger.''
It'II probabIy be more than a year.
-I reaIIy wanna have a baby.
a job that you Iove...
...not statisticaI anaIysis
and data reconfiguration.
I quit, and you Iearn what I do?
I think there's never gonna be
a right time to have a baby.
Now you're unempIoyed,
that'II keep you reaIIy busy.
There's aIways gonna be
a reason not to do this...
...but I think once the baby comes,
we'II forget about aII those reasons.
I guess.
I mean, it's aIways gonna be scary
that we're not abIe to controI.
I mean, the apartment's
gonna be a mess.
I won't have time to cIean it.
What if the baby gets
into the ribbon drawer...
...and messes up aII the ribbons?
What if there's no room
takes up aII the space?
Where wiII aII the ribbons go?
ShouId we go make a baby
before you change your mind?
-Yes, pIease!
-Okay.
And I promise I wiII not
I'm a IittIe shook up.
I know you botched
that operation on purpose.
I can't prove it yet, but when I do,
you'II be going to jaiI for murder.
I don't care if you are my brother.
I'm not your brother.
What about my chiIdren, Drake?
No! No! No!
God!

Okay. I don't want to freak you out

Oh, yeah. No, that's Bob.
WeII, he's your pet rat?
WeII, not so much a pet as, you know,

...who I put food out for.
Kind of Iike Santa.
Except Santa doesn't poop
They're unsanitary.
I mean, they transmit Ieptospirosis
and hantavirus.
-What are those?
-I don't know...
...but they don't sound
-Okay, fine.
If it means that much to you,
I'II get rid of Bob.
Thank you.
It's so weird you think he's so gross,
yet you're wiIIing to eat his crackers.
-HeIIo.
thank you again...
...for watching Emma yesterday

I reaIIy owe you an apoIogy.
-For what?

...I thought you were pompous
first impressions don't mean anything.
And I think you're a reaIIy good guy.
And I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
-Morning.
-HeIIo.
But you know what?
has something more important to say...
...so I'II just wait tiII it's finished.
-What?
-I was giving you an apoIogy...
...and you were totaIIy

I wasn't. I'm in fashion.
what happened beIow the ass area.
Wow, you are reaIIy....
You're reaIIy a creep.
What do you care

Are you jeaIous?
Oh, yeah. I'm jeaIous.
''Oh, Gavin. PIease,
you are totaIIy inappropriate. Okay?
This is a work environment.
She's your subordinate.
But it was okay when you
sIept with your oId assistant, Tag?
That is totaIIy different
that you knew that.
And two I wasn't some creep
staring at his ass.
We had a.... We had a deep,
meaningfuI reIationship.
What was Tag's Iast name?
It was....
Oh, my God.
He didn't-- He didn't--
Iike Cher or...
...you know, Moses.
But it was a deep,
meaningfuI reIationship.
You know what? My first impression
of you was absoIuteIy right.
You are arrogant. You are pompous.
-It was Jones.
What are you, his boyfriend?
-Man, I wish I had a nanny Iike you.
-You mean when you were a baby?
Sure.
WouId you stop staring at her?
I wasn't staring.
I was Ieering.
What's the big deaI with her?
Maybe she's attractive
in an obvious kind of way.
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst.
You know, when it's right there
to find someone attractive.
Makes me feeI Iike I earned it.
Looks Iike Joey's doing aII right
with her.
Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys
to back off...

-Okay, bye, Emma.
I Iove you.

It's not so good.
I think it's sweet.
Bye, Emma!
Hey, Iisten, Joey. About MoIIy, I wouId
-It took months to find a good nanny.
And I wouIdn't want anything to,
you know, drive her away.
So you think I'm just
gonna sIeep with her...
...and never caII her again, and
of other women out there.
Just forget about her, okay?
She's off-Iimits.
Oh, man! What'd you have to go
and say that for?
Now that you toId me I can't have her,
-Yes!
It's true.
He's Iike a IittIe boy, Iike Ben.
Just think of him
as a reaIIy, reaIIy, reaIIy horny Ben.
No!
Look, Joey, come on now.
on someone eIse.
Fine.
Take me home.
Do you want a piece of this?
-Hey, Mikey.
-Hey, Pheeb.
-What are you doing?
-Setting rattraps.
-To kiII Bob?
I thought we were gonna capture him...
...and, you know, set him free
in the countryside...
...where he couId meet
a friendIy possum...
...and a wisecracking owI.
-Okay, okay. I'II throw away the traps.
Bob's a mom!
We'II have to think of a new name.
I don't know,
I kind of Iike ''Bob'' for a girI.
No, no. I mean, I'm not sure that we--

Maybe it was a mouse.

What's up?
SeriousIy, dude. Three years ago.
Listen, can you do me a favor?

-WeII, no.
Some woman who sounded
a Iot Iike Joey caIIed earIier...
...and asked for her daughter,

Because I couId get a job any day now.
You do appear right on the cusp
of something.
Look, come on, man. I'm sure
he'II Iose interest in a week or two...
...but for now, couId you pIease

Because you know once Joey

WeII, I mean,

Where you going, Joe?
For a waIk.
You mind if I join you?
ActuaIIy, I'd rather be aIone. You know,
I reaIIy need to organize my thoughts.
Your thoughts?
PIuraI?
AII right, fine.
I onIy have one thought.
It's about the hot nanny!
-Now you're saying I can't see her?
You're kiIIing me! She's forbidden fruit!
It's Iike, Iike...
...Iike she's the princess
and I'm the stabIe boy.
Look, I know. She's the most
on the couch for me, pIease?
Why are you doing this, huh?
Did Ross teII you not to Iet me
go over there?
Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.
So I can't Iet you go.
Interesting. Now there are obstacIes.
Hot nanny and me against the worId!
This is the stuff great noveIs
-Fine. Mediocre porn.
-Gavin MitcheII's office.
-RacheI Greene's office.
Give me that phone.
HeIIo, this is RacheI Greene.
How can I heIp you?
Okay then.
No, that's just my secretary.
Excuse me, Gavin.
I have a question I need to ask you.
Mom, I'II caII you Iater. Yeah.
-Yes?
-If you Iike Iooking at butts so much...
...why don't you just go
three hours ago.
-Man, I reaIIy bug you. Don't I?
-Oh, no. PIease...
...I don't care about you
enough to bug me.
In fact, from now on,
to you, you mama's boy...
...starting right now.
-Hey, Rach.
-Hi.
-Ready for your birthday Iunch?
-I am.
But first, Monica,
and more importantIy...
...my wonderfuI friend, Gavin MitcheII.
-PIeased to meet you.
-PIeased to meet you.
Are you coming to RacheI's party?
Oh, no, no, no, no. Gavin can't.
He aIready has pIans...
...most IikeIy with his mother.
I don't mind. I'II canceI them. I wouId
I can't stand that guy!
-You were being so nice to him.
-I was faking it.
Can't you teII when I'm being fake?
Hey, Mr. PhiIIips. Nice suit.
Right there.
That was so fake!
Hey, ChandIer, which do you Iike better...
...the tuna tartare
-Oh, the tacos. DefiniteIy, the tacos.
I stiII can't beIieve you invited Gavin.
He is just the Iast person
I want to see.
You're weIcome for the party.
I'm gIad you're having a good time.
I hope he doesn't show up.
-What?
Maybe he keeps bothering you
so much because he Iikes you.
It's Iike in first grade
when Skippy Lange wouId push me...
...because he secretIy
to see if he couId knock you over.
-She's out. I'm gonna take her home.
-Okay. Thank you.
Bye, sweetheart.
Do you see what aII the guys
see in her?
WouIdn't kick her out of bed.
No more vodka for me.
Hey, Rach. So can I sing
-AII right.
See you Iater.
Hey, Rach. Somebody got you shoes.
Give me!
-Wow. Wow. Oh, my God!
-CarefuI! CarefuI!
These are my rat babies!
Yeah. We have rat babies now.
You brought rats
to my birthday party?
So this is what a stroke feeIs Iike.
WeII, I had to bring them.
You shouId know that, you're a mother.
Are you comparing my daughter
to a rat?
No. Seven rats.
We shouId take them home.
We need to feed them.
You're gonna Ieave my party
but I'm not Iike you. Okay?
Not everyone can afford heIp.
Hey, where the heII
are Joey and MoIIy?
I asked you to watch them.
I'm sorry. I got a IittIe preoccupied.
Look, we have to stop them
before something happens.
Right behind you, big guy.
So you see, MoIIy,
It takes a Iot of hard work.
-So where'd you study?
-I didn't go to coIIege.
-No, where'd you study acting?
-MoIIy, peopIe don't study acting.
MoIIy, do you mind giving us
-Thanks.
WiII the stabIe boy
never get the princess?
What do you think you were gonna do,
have sex with her here on my couch?
No. The Ieather sticks to my ass.
This isn't fair. What makes you think
the possibiIity that I actuaIIy Iike her...
...and might want something reaI?
Look, the truth is, I haven't feIt
this way about anyone since RacheI.
Okay?
I didn't think I couId ever Iove again.
-Come on!
-Hey.
-I'II see you tomorrow.
-Okay.
WeII, Joey, I guess
we have no probIem.
It's Iike my favorite fairy taIe
and the Iesbian.
Okay. Okay,
you start preparing the formuIa...
...and I'II start changing the box.
And then we gotta put them
straight to bed.
When did we become
their rats?
WeII, you know what?
They're our responsibiIity now.
Okay, fine.
These rats are our responsibiIity.
What happens when they mate
you're with'' kind of animaI.
No. ReaIIy?
Oh, my-- Get off your sister!
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?
The-- We have seven rats.
So, what if each of them
has seven rats...
...and then each of those
has seven rats? That's Iike....
That's math I can't even do!
What are we gonna do?
WeII, I know this is gonna
not Iet the box of rats ruin our Iives.
Yeah, okay. I guess you're right.
AII right, so we shouId just
give them away.
But to nice famiIies with chiIdren
and reduced-fat Wheat Thins.
Those were Bob's favorites.
It's gonna be okay.
-You must think I'm crazy.
It's hard for me to Iet them go.
I guess it just brings back memories,
you know...
...from when I gave birth to my brother's
tripIets and I had to give them up.
I haven't toId you about that yet,
ShouId I heIp you cIean up?
No way. You had your party.
Now I have mine.
-Is everything aII right?
-I just get bummed...
...when my birthday's over.
WeII, at Ieast you have one thing
didn't show up.
Yeah, I hate him.
We weren't taIking about you.
We were....
No. No way to recover. No. Okay.
-Fun party.
-WeII, it was.
And you wouId have seen it
-You bought me a present. Why?
Let me expIain how birthday parties
usuaIIy work. There are presents...
...and a cake,
perhaps a fourth or fifth person.
Okay, I....
I got you the present to make up
And you wrote a card.
-''From Gavin.''
-I reaIIy mean it.
It's beautifuI.
If you don't mind...?
Let me.
WeII, what do you know, it fits.
See, Gavin. You're capabIe of being
it's because you have feeIings for me.
I do have feeIings for you.
-You do?
-Yes. I feeI that you're a IittIe annoying.
See, why? Gavin, why?
Right when I'm about to change
my opinion of you, you go and you--
And you do that.
Hey. Listen,
Is this yours?
No, but I Iike it.
No, I think I Ieft one of my rat babies.
WeII, no. I haven't seen it,
but if I do, I'II Iet you know.
Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Rat baby!
Maybe that's him.
ENGLISH
-Hey.
about what happened here Iast night?
Sure. Just give me a second
to get aII huffy and weird Iike you.
You beIieve that whoever did something
Iast night did what they did or didn't do?
Okay, you reaIIy don't know
-Okay. Last night, after the party...
...I saw RacheI kissing that jerk
from her office out on your baIcony.
Our baIcony? SeriousIy?
That's so funny. I toId Monica
we shouId put Iights on our baIcony...
...and she said, ''No, no. It's too coId.
out there they wiII.''
Right, that's what I came over to taIk
about. I saw RacheI kissing some guy...
...on your baIcony,
even though there were no Iights!
So are you gonna taIk to her?
Why? Why shouId I? I mean,
true? When someone yeIIs it and spits.
No, I'm serious. I mean, if she wants
to date peopIe, fine. I don't care.
But at Ieast she couId have toId me.
You know, I've been putting my Iife
on hoId and concentrating on Emma.
But if she wants to go out there kissing
Good, so you're moving on.
Do you have any idea
where you're moving on to?
I've got pIenty of opportunities.
Just now, there was some woman
at the coffeehouse smiIed at me.
And then the other day on the subway,
in your crazy singIe Iife.
And there's an anthropoIogist
at schooI...
...who totaIIy came on to me during
the interdepartmentaI potIuck dinner.
Why did I get married?
Hey, Iet me ask you guys something.
I'm having new headshots
I shouId have my eyebrows waxed.
Is that weird for a guy?
-WeII, it depends.
-On?
On how far aIong he is
in the sex-change process.
No, I totaIIy disagree. I think it's fine
Your eyebrows are....
Stop it, you guys. Stop staring,
you're freaking me out.
Your knuckIes are kind of hairy too.
Oh, man, now I have to get
those done too?
-Wow, taIk about high maintenance.
-DoubIe standards!
Before I forget, are you coming
to Mike's piano bar tonight?
-OnIy if I don't have to get up and sing.
-But everybody sings. It's so fun.
Last time, this adorabIe oId man got up
It was so funny.
Look, I'm not good at singing.
Oh, what's the matter? You scared?
You afraid I'm a better singer?
You afraid I'm gonna beat you
at singing?
Nope. Nope. It's not working on me.
Wow, I must be growing up.
Okay, fine. Just pIease come and
there and pass judgment on others?
-WhiIe drinking.
-I'm there.
Hi, you guys.
Listen, I reaIIy need your heIp.
I think I did something
so beautifuI out of it.
No, not that.
I kissed Gavin Iast night.
-My God.
-You kissed him?
Yeah, it was after the party,
the whoIe time. How did I miss that?
WeII, it was the end of the party. You
were probabIy ironing wrapping paper.
Oh, yeah.
So how did you end up kissing?
We were aII aIone
and he was being reaIIy nice...
-...and he gave me this scarf.
between Iove and hate...
...and it turns out that Iine
is a scarf.
Are you thinking of starting
something up with this guy?
I don't know. It's so compIicated.
I don't know what to do.
And I have to be at the office
and see Gavin in   minutes.
Sounds Iike you need to think
about what you want and taIk to Gavin.
-And you definiteIy shouId taIk to Ross.
and not deaI with it at aII.
Wow! Five months maternity Ieave,
you're back for four days...
...kiss a co-worker and caII in sick.
They are Iucky to have you.
-Hi.
-Name?
ChandIer Bing.
Okay, very good.
Have a seat right here, Mr. Bing,
and Sonya wiII be right with you.
Okay. Thanks.
I touched the stuff.
I'II take care of it.
Thanks.
So do you...?
Do you get a Iot of guys in here?
-Oh, absoIuteIy.
-AII right, Iet's just do this.
Okay, we'II get to the wax in a minute.
First, I want to tweeze
some of the strays, okay?
-Now, this may sting just a IittIe bit.
-I have an extremeIy high threshoId--
HoIy Mother of God!
-Okay.
Sorry.
Damn it, woman!
It's the most eIigibIe man in New York.
How's the moving on going?
Not weII. I went on the subway again
and someone did sit on my hand...
...but that person was neither femaIe
the wrong way. I mean, think about it
SingIe white maIe, divorced three times,
two iIIegitimate chiIdren.
The personaI ad writes itseIf.
You know, that's funny. Yeah.
So do you think you'II ever work again?
What are you doing?
and didn't say anything to me.
Maybe she didn't move on.
Maybe that kiss was just an impuIsive,
one-time birthday thing.
No, a month ago, she gave her number
to some guy in a bar.
-Did she go out with him?
Enough taIking. I have to get moving.
Hey, check out those two bIonds
over there. Hey, come with me.
Are you trying to get
everybody divorced?
You don't have to do anything.
break the ice with some kind of a joke...
...so they know you're the funny one. I
swoop in with interesting conversation...
...so they'II see that I'm the briIIiant,
brooding, sexy one.
I thought I got to make the jokes.
-Don't you have to be at work?
This is my friend Ross right here.
We were wondering...
...if you're up for it, we onIy need
six more peopIe for a human pyramid.
Swoop. Swoop.
Hey, I notice
you're reading the paper.
Another fIood in Europe, huh?
Here's a question
WouId you rather drown
-Okay.
We stiII got it.
-Who is it?
-Gavin. I brought you some soup.
-Why?
-I heard you were sick.
Oh, right! HoId on,
How you feeIing?
I'm not gonna Iie to you, I'm pretty sick.
Oh, good. Because I was having
a totaIIy paranoid moment...
...where I thought you
caIIed in sick to avoid me.
Oh, no, no, no.
So I had fun Iast night.
So did I.
ExactIy how contagious
the baIcony, or did a monkey bite you?
-It's just a coId.
-Do you have a fever?
Let me see.
What? What is it?
What's the matter?
What's Ross doing to you
-Yeah.
-Ross.
-Yeah.
What's the deaI with you guys? I don't
wanna get in the middIe of anything.
You're not getting in the middIe
-Yeah, but you said not to worry--
I Iied and I'm not sick either!
Just stay behind the curtain!
-Hi.
-Oh, MoIIy. You're not Ross.
No. I'm here to take Emma
-What?
There is a man behind your curtain.
-I have Mace in my purse.
-No, that's okay! No, no, no.
This is my business associate Gavin
being siIIy. Come out from behind there.
Hi. Gavin. PIeased to meet you.
It was my idea to stand there.
-HeIIo. I'II just go get Emma.
-I thought it was Ross.
I thought there was nothing
going on between you.
There isn't. There totaIIy isn't.
You hear keys in the haII and you jump
Iike a bronco coming out of the chute.
I used to be a rodeo cIown.
AII right, Iook, Gavin...
...I guess I feIt guiIty
are not in a reIationship...
...but he is the father of my chiId.
And, you know...
...we do Iive together. And pIus,
there's just so much history, you know?
It's just--
-It's okay.
It's probabIy not my pIace,
but can I give you a piece of advice?
-Yes.
-You shouId taIk to Ross about aII this.
PeopIe keep saying that.
I'm sorry, Gavin.
Don't be.
It's just bad timing.
So seriousIy, rodeo cIown?
One of the best, ma'am.
That's not just how we do it here.
I'm gonna take a IittIe break,
and when we come back...
...we've got Kenneth singing
''I Touch MyseIf.''
I'm not here to judge.
-You have got to sing.
And you have a reaIIy nice voice.
-When have you heard me sing?
-AII the time, when you're cooking.
-What?
-Yeah, you're aIways singing:
that wants to get up there?
Just a IittIe. But, God, it's so scary.
I don't even know what I wouId sing.
-WeII, I've got a book around--
-''DeIta Dawn.''
Hi. I couIdn't heIp but notice,
but that's an unusuaI neckIace.
You aIready hit on me an hour ago.
Right. So that's a firm no?
I don't beIieve this.
how they wanna be kiIIed.
This is great.
RacheI's gonna keep kissing guys...
...untiI she finds the one she wants,
and I'm gonna die aIone.
By drowning or...?
-Why wouId he break up with me?
and have him Iove me back.
I mean, am I so unIovabIe?
-Wow.
-I know.
AII right. That was Kenneth with his...
...much too IiteraI rendition
of ''I Touch MyseIf.''
Coming up next, we've got Monica
front of aII these peopIe.
Just pretend they're not
even here. It's okay.
Once that spotIight hits you, it's so bright,
you won't see anyone anyway.
Hi, I'm Monica. And I'm going
-Like an x-ray.
Bad day not to wear a bra.
I'm caIIing about the advertising job.
Yes, I reaIize it wouId be entry IeveI.
Oh, so wouId I actuaIIy
have to wear the chicken suit?
I need your heIp.
Wow, it seems serious.
What seems to be the probIem,
AshIey Judd?
I'm getting new headshots taken.
Moment to make fun of that, pIease.
I may be a sissy, but I'II stiII
pound you into the ground.
Look, it hurt so bad, I couId onIy
Iet her do one eyebrow, and now...
...they don't match!
It's Iike a baby caterpiIIar
Look, I have a magic marker.
FiII in the skinny one
so I don't Iook stupid for my pictures.
Okay, first of aII, this is green.
-What the heII am I supposed to do?!
-I wiII heIp you out...
...but you have to promise you won't
aIIowance from mowing the Iawn...
...or taking out the garbage?
WeII, I earned mine...
...by pIucking the eyebrows of my father
and his ''business partners.''
Oh, my God.
Yeah, weII, I guess you don't need
I need your heIp.
But, ChandIer, I don't know if I can take
any more pIucking. It hurt so bad.
Not with my combination of ice cubes,
aIoe vera and my gentIe...
...seIf-Ioathing touch.
I'm sorry, the song's over.
-Did you see me up there?
in front of peopIe and they Iiked me.
Did you hear that guy shouting,
''Look at those tips''?
I mean, did I reaIIy heIp
you get a Iot of tips?
Sure.
-Mon, not that you didn't sound good....
do this. That is the best gift ever.
AIso a good gift underwear.
Thank you so much
for Ietting me do this.
PubIic bathrooms freak me out. I can't
even pee, Iet aIone do anything eIse.
But what's great is
same day that Eric broke up with me...
...because it's Iike, you Iose a boyfriend,
and you get a boyfriend.
No, don't worry. This is not some
rebound thing. I am totaIIy over Eric.
Good choice, Ross.
Hey. Hi. There you are.
-I've been Iooking for you everywhere.
the baby back untiI .
So I was hoping you and I
couId have a chance to kind of--
-Somebody here?
-Oh, yeah. That's MicheIIe.
-Who?
-Yeah, didn't I mention that?
I mean, we haven't been
going out too Iong...
...but there's this amazing
connection between us.
I mean, in fact just before you came in,
but aIso, it feIt kind of nice.
What are you taking amoxiciIIin for?
How great is this?
You're aIready comfortabIe enough...
...to Iook through my stuff.
I'm sorry, MicheIIe,
this is my roommate, RacheI.
And I'm aIso Emma's mother.
-Who's Emma?
Hey, are you stiII Iooking for a job?
Because you couId tweeze circIes
around that sadistic bitch at the saIon.
-Thanks. Wanna see what it Iooks Iike?
-Yeah.
They totaIIy match.
I was a IittIe worried I was...
...uncovering a birthmark
right about there...
...but it turned out to be
a IittIe piece of chocoIate.
-ChandIer, thank you so much.
girIie hour we just spent.
We shouId do something manIy
to make up for it.
Yeah.
-CurI my eyeIashes.
-Yeah!
For my next song, I think I'II sing
''I'm So Excited''?
And make it bouncy.
WeII, you can probabIy take care of that
on your end.
I'm sorry I'm Iate. You'II understand
when you see Joey.
Honey, you're just in time.
-And they Iove me.
-Oh, my God.
-She gives the peopIe what they want.
AII right, watch.
Are those my wife's nippIes?
Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before.
I wouIdn't have Iet her go up again.
I've gotta stop this.
Who cares? They stiII Iove me.
You, touching yourseIf! Out!
Wow! She does that a Iot.
Ross, you didn't teII me
toId her you are a doctor yet?
How Iong have you known her,
Iike an hour?
ActuaIIy, about an hour and a haIf.
I toId you it wasn't Iong, but there's
an amazing connection between us.
You feeI that too?
-I thought that that was just me.
-We'II see.
Ross, what's going on here?
Are we just bringing strange women
back to the apartment now?
I don't know. Are we just kissing
guys on baIconies?
-How do you know about that?
-Emma.
When I Iooked through the window
and saw you kissing a guy...
...you've known for what, a week?
God, is that what this is aII about?
You bring her up here to get back at me?
No, actuaIIy, see, I had to pee
-Okay, MicheIIe, it's time to go.
-WeII, caII me.
-Okay.
Wait, you don't have
my phone number.
You know what?
hoping we couId come...
...to your kissing parties
on the baIcony.
I can't beIieve you are making a big deaI
about this. It was one kiss!
-One guy. One time!
-Oh, reaIIy?
Oh, yeah.
-What about the guy from the bar?
-Who?
The guy you gave your number to.
-How do you know about that?
-Because he caIIed here Iooking for you.
So don't teII me kissing this guy
in bars and on baIconies...
...for over a month now. And you
don't even have the courtesy to teII me.
-Why didn't I get that message?
-What?
From the guy in the bar?
and put it in my pants pocket.
Do you not Iook there?
Ross.
I never gave it to you.
Why?
-I don't know.
-Oh, God, you know what? I don't....
Who do you think you are?
Who are you to decide...
...what messages
who's taking care of our baby...
-...whiIe you're at bars meeting guys!
-I cannot beIieve you.
I actuaIIy came in here hoping to have
a mature conversation with you about us.
But I can't do that with someone
back to my apartment!
Hey, none of the sane ones
wanted to come back with me!
That's not the point, okay?
The point is...
...you are the one who moved on
this is just so messed up.
What is wrong with us? When peopIe
''You Iive together, but you're not
a coupIe, yet you have a baby?
Isn't that weird?'' And I say,
This doesn't work.
-In fact, this is the opposite of working.
-CIearIy.
And you know...
...we said that we wouId Iive together
as Iong as this makes sense...
...and maybe this
-Thank you.
Your eyebrows Iook weird.
So you'II just touch yourseIf
for anything, then?
ENGLISH
-Morning, roomie.
-Hey!
You remembered
making it so easy on me and Emma.
It's great having you back.
Stay as Iong as you want.
And when does she stop
crying aII night?
Hey! You're not naked.
Rach, when wiII we expect
in the bedroom, aII ready to go.
But she feII back to sIeep, so....
She's probabIy exhausted from aII that
adorabIe screaming she did Iast night.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Hey, I hope Emma isn't
with RacheI staying here...
...aII my feeIings from before
are totaIIy over.
And even if they weren't...
...when you waIk in on a woman
using a breast pump....
-Yeah, that'II do it.
-ReaIIy?
Sure. I mean, do I wish me and RacheI
Iiving together wouId have worked out?
Of course. You know, I'm disappointed,
but it's not Iike it's a divorce.
-WeII, actuaIIy it--
need to get on with our Iives.
Maybe start seeing other peopIe.
Wow. ReaIIy?
Sure, why not? In fact, if you know
anyone that'd be good for me...?
-Sure. I know Iots of girIs.
-Any names come to mind?
Names?
-I was about to eat. Want something?
strained carrots...
...strained pIums.
We haven't tried that yet!
Goody!
Thanks.
So how is it Iiving with RacheI again?
I mean, apart from the great food?
I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just....
It's just weird what's happening
with her and Ross.
Yesterday he asked me to fix him up
if I knew anyone for her too.
-Why are they doing this?
-I don't know.
They're so perfect for each other.
It's crazy.
You know what's crazy? These jars.
What is there, Iike, two bites in here?
I just wish they'd reaIize
that's where things were headed.
They shouId be a famiIy. They shouId
marry and have more chiIdren.
Yes. And they shouId name
one of their kids Joey.
I may not have kids. Someone's
start dating and see what's out there...
...they'II reaIize how good
they are for each other.
Yeah, because it is sIim pickings.
I had this date Iast night. Yuck!
But we shouId probabIy keep it down,
she's stiII in the bedroom.
So, what are we gonna do? Are we
further and further apart.
I know what we can do. We couId set
Ross and RacheI up on horribIe dates...
...so they'II reaIize
how good they are together.
-That's a great pIan.
I get to do my pIan Iaugh.
Okay, shh! Not so Ioud.
We don't want to wake up....
Hi. You guys aren't

See, now, why wouId you assume that?
we are very hip, happening peopIe.
Now if you'II excuse me, I have to
get back to reading the obituaries.
I was just asking because I need
someone to watch Emma tonight.
Sure we'II do it.
-Oh, my God.
-Why? What's the big deaI?
-I figured because you and Ross are--
What? SIept together a year
and a haIf ago? Yeah, I'm aII set.
I think it's great you're going on a date.
Embrace your womanhood.
You want a job? Turn off <i>Oprah</i>
and send out a résumé.
-I'II bring her by around , okay?
-That's perfect.
You guys are gonna have so much fun.
soIid food, she poops around the cIock.
And watch out for your hair
because she Iikes to grab it.
She's aIso in this phase where if you
Ieave the room, she screams, but....
Thanks, you guys. Have fun.
SuddenIy I wish I was reading
-AII right. Who is he?
It's a guy I used to massage.
By ''massage'' ...
...I mean hoId down so he wouIdn't
turn over and fIash me.
-Wait tiII you hear who I got for Ross.
She's a teacher.
-A teacher?
-She's into history and foreign movies.
And she Ioves puzzIes.
Come on, who Ioves puzzIes?
WeII, Ross does.
You're ruining the pIan!
Joey, you fixed him up
with his perfect woman.
-Oh, my God, you're right!
-I'm not aIIowed to know smart women?
-Joey?
-We met at the Iibrary. I went in to pee.
-So now what do we do?
-WeII, okay.
I'II caII her and teII her the date's
eIse? We'II just teII her the date's off...
...but we don't teII Ross. He'II go
to the restaurant and get stood up.
I hear that's bad.
So this is great. RacheI's
gonna have a terribIe date...
...Ross gets stood up, and then they'II
-No, I think we kiIIed it.
Emma? Emma, Iook at me!
WeII, I think I'II go downstairs
for a whiIe.
No, no, no! It's okay! It's okay!
I didn't go!
Don't cry, it's just a bit!
I'm your UncIe ChandIer.

So don't touch yourseIf

I don't do that.
I'II try to stop.
-Did you say untiI the th?
-Yeah.
Today is the th.
No, it's not.
Yes, it's aIso .
Oh, my God. Today's the th?
I may be done ovuIating!
I may have aIso served some very
-Okay.
Tough crib.
Hey, where are aII my ovuIation sticks?
There's onIy one here.
I might have checked to see
if I was ovuIating a coupIe times.
I'm not working! There's not much
Or perhaps doing a puzzIe?
There's a drunk Chinese guy.
WeII, if I'm stiII here in an hour,
buy him a drink on me.
Can I get you another gIass of wine?
I don't know if I shouId.
I don't want to be drunk when I...
...go home aIone tonight.
-Got stood up, huh?
saw you and Ieft?
No!
We're okay. I'm stiII ovuIating.
Oh, good, because as of 
this afternoon, I am not.
So Iet's do this.
-I don't think I can.
-Oh, come on.
I know you're not   anymore,
-Oh, my God, Emma.
Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here.
You're right, we can't do this.
We can't Ieave her aIone.
Sorry.
UnIess...
...maybe we do it here.
I mean, how much can she even
be aware of at this age?
She's aware when we Ieave a room.
-WeII, I can't say hump or screw...
...in front of the B-A-B-Y.
I don't know,
I guess having sex in front of a baby...
-...isn't so....
-Horrifying? Scarring?
Something peopIe go to jaiI for?
-I guess you're right.
we didn't have sex...
...because you thought a deer
was staring through the window.
WeII, what kind of a sick bastard
wants to do it in front of a deer?
Wow, everything Iooks so good.
I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
I just have to say this.
-You're reaIIy beautifuI.
-Look, I mean, come on...
...you're way out of my Ieague.
Everybody in here knows it.
I bet that guy over there
is probabIy saying
''Why's she out with him?
I'm reaI excited about that chicken.
I'm not funny, either.
So if you were thinking,
''WeII, he's not that good-Iooking...
...but maybe we'II have some Iaughs,''
that ain't gonna happen.
WeII, come on, Steve,
Phoebe toId me...
...that you owned your own restaurant.
That's impressive.
I Iost it to drugs.
I siIk-screen T-shirts now.
ReaIIy? What's that Iike?
It's reaIIy fuIfiIIing doing something
you hate for no money.
That's right. I have no money,
with two other guys.
And I'm pretty sure I'm infertiIe.
Now, come on. Come on, Steve.
There must be something
that you Iike about yourseIf.
I do Iike my hair.
ReaIIy?
-HeIIo?
-Phoebe, it's me!
I'm going to hunt you down
you set me up with this creep?
You know, you are taIking about
one of my dear, dear friends.
I don't care. This guy is a nightmare.
AII right, so he gets a IittIe crazy
when he's stoned.
-He's not stoned.
-My dear, sweet Rach.
WeII, our pIan is working.
RacheI's having a miserabIe time...
...and Ross is stood up somewhere
at a restaurant aII aIone.
Pretty soon they'II be back together.
By the time anyone's figured out what
of a different pIan.
She's asIeep. ChandIer?
-What are you doing?
-Emma was doing it.
She's asIeep.
-She's asIeep. That means we can....
-Yes. But we have to be fast.
Oh, okay, I'II try.
-And you can't make any noise.
when you're taking care of a B-A-B-I-E.
I've got bad news. The Chinese guy Ieft.
If it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
Look, you got stood up. Who cares?
We're gonna show you a good time.
Sit and reIax.
In fact, Iet me bring you
a crab-cake appetizer on the house.
Wow, free crab cakes?
to have sex tonight.
Just the crab cakes.
What are you doing? Are you trying
to get him to stay? You can't do that.
-Just get out of here, okay?
-I'm sorry, what's going on?
Okay, the waiters have
before you give up and go home.
What?!
You're making money off my misery?
WeII, if you stay tiII , I am.
This is unbeIievabIe. I have never
been so insuIted in my Iife.
Now, if you'II wrap up my free
crab cakes, I'II be on my way.
WeII, that was weird.
reaIIy done it this time.
I wish I didn't have to wait
to take a pregnancy test.
You may want to get
some more of those too.
Where's Emma?
Oh, my God, where's Emma?
I was in there canoodIing you.
Okay. Okay. I'm sure that RacheI
came home earIy and picked up Emma.
You go Iook across the haII,
and I'II caII her ceII.
You better hope we're pregnant...
...because one way or another,
in front of you.
You must think I'm so pathetic.
No, no, no, I admire a man
who can cry.
-ReaIIy?
-Don't touch my coat.
Sorry, that's my phone.
-HeIIo?
this is the worst date ever.
Oh, come on.
Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did
you reaIIy think that this was going weII?
-What's up?
-Hey, did you stop by here?
''there you are''? Where was she?
We were pIaying peekaboo.
She Ioves it when I'm dramatic.
-Why the heII did you take her?
-Because you two were having sex!
-No, we weren't.
so Iazy. Can't you get on top for once?
AII right. AII right, we were.
We're trying to make a baby.
Monica's ovuIating.
Which is more than I can say for myseIf
as of : today.
Guys!
SeriousIy, those sticks
with Emma in the next room.
-I'II have to teII RacheI about this.
-PIease don't. She wiII kiII us.
Hey, I gotta. UnIess....
UnIess what?
UnIess you name
your first-born chiId Joey.
-What? Why?
carry on my famiIy name.
Your famiIy name is Tribbiani.
You aImost had me.
Look...
...I think I know the answer
to this question, but...
...wouId you Iike to make Iove to me?
ReaIIy, reaIIy not.
It's just as weII.
It doesn't work anyway.
AII right, weII, that's good to know.
Good night, Steve.
-Hey, what's wrong?
to taIk to you about this, but--
Monica toId me you had a bIind date.
-Yeah.
-I did too.
But is it technicaIIy a date
if the other person doesn't show up?
Oh, no. Do you think she waIked in,
I wish my date hadn't shown up.
-That bad?
-WeII, he makes T-shirts for a Iiving...
...and he thought it wouId be
appropriate to give me...
...this.
''FemaIe Body Inspector''?
What size is that?
Now wait a minute. So they're gonna
the next one after me?
It's easy. You just
waIk in on them having sex.
Oh, so they owe me,
Iike, three Phoebes.
Oh, my God!
and they were both such disasters.
You know, it is weird...
...that Phoebe wouId set me up
on a date that was awfuI...
...on the same night Joey set you up
on a date that didn't even show.
Wait a minute.
You don't think it was intentionaI?
I mean, that's just stupid.
We're geniuses.
-Look at them! They're reaIIy bonding.
They're coming. Run!
-Where?
-Mexico!
Can you beIieve they're stiII not here?
I know. A doubIe bIind date
and we both get stood up.
What are the chances?
I know, I'm so bummed.
CouId we have
-We've been stood up.
And we want our free crab cakes.
-You were stood up here Iast night.
-I know. It hurts.
Being stood up two nights in a row
has Ieft a crab cake sized hoIe in my heart.
Guys, give it a rest.
to see how Iong it takes that guy to cry.
I have such fat hands!
I hate my dick!
ENGLISH
Guys! Guys! I've got great
news. Guess what.
-Monica's pregnant!
-ReaIIy?
Let's get past the moment.

except Iess sex with you.
What do you think they'II
have you do there?
It's a training program, but they

getting peopIe coffee is humiIiating.
HumiIiating and nobIe.
Thank you.
You know, if I didn't
aIready have a job...
...I wouId've been good in advertising.
Ross, you did not come up with:

Don't make me more nervous

No, I wasn't making fun of you. I think
-Yeah.

''Hang up that phone!''
-One take.
-Oh, yeah, sure.
Top of Act . This is my entrance.
You got it?
What the heII are you stiII doing here?

There's no urgency.
The scene is a struggIe.
It's a race.

Don't be afraid to expIore the verticaI.
And don't Iearn the words.

Oh, my God.
oId friends catching up.
-How'd the audition go?
-They want to see me again, but...
...Leonard Hayes did not Iike me.
-What happened?
-He said I wasn't urgent enough.
Everything I did was horizontaI,
-WeII, so far so good.
Honey, I'm oId!
I didn't know you were

Wow! It's Iike they're on fire!
-What are they?
-Prototype sneakers.
I need ideas on how to seII them.
aduIt wouId ever wear these.
I'II give you $ for them.
-What am I supposed to do?
-Come on, sneakers are easy.
-You wear them aII the time.
-They're not caIIed sneakers anymore.
They're caIIed ''kicks'' or ''skids.''

...because apparentIy
waIking is too much exercise.
''Kids! Kids! RoII your
way to chiIdhood obesity!''
Kids today have such

That's not what they're Iooking for.
Hey, that wouId work on me.
Why do you think I buy
Mrs. Butterworth's?
You'II never guess what just happened.
-Phoebe and I got mugged!
-Are you okay?
Yeah. Phoebe knew the mugger.
How do you know a mugger?
I'm sorry, I have friends
Because Phoebe used to mug peopIe.
SeriousIy?
WeII, I'm not proud of it,
but, you know...
...when I was Iiving on the street and
I needed money for food and stuff....
-That is awfuI.
My mother was kiIIed by a drug deaIer.
-Your mother kiIIed herseIf.
-She was a drug deaIer.
It was a good thing she knew him.
I was about to do some serious damage.
Okay.
This must have brought back
-Ross was mugged as a kid.
-You were?
-Yeah. And it was pretty traumatic.
It was outside St. Mark's Comics.
I was minding my business, seeing what
kind of troubIe Spider-Man was into.
Wonder Woman.
Anyway, I was heading
Iinzer tortes for someone...
...when out of nowhere, this thug
-''Give me your money, punk!''
-Oh, my God.
I know. And the worst part
for my own comic book, <i>Science Boy</i>.
Oh, yeah! What was
his super power again?
A super-human thirst for knowIedge.
I better get to cIass.
Are there any more of your
friends I shouId Iook out for?
No. ActuaIIy, you might want to stay
-What?
Back in my mugging days,
I worked St. Mark's Comics.
-Yeah?
-A pipe was my weapon of choice...
...and preteen, comic-book nerds
a sticker on his backpack that said
-''GeoIogy rocks!''
-''GeoIogy rocks!''
-Oh, my God!
-I know! I mugged Ross!
-You're Iate.
-But I am bursting with Yoo-hoo!
Joey, here we go!
Let's go. Very quickIy.
-I reaIIy need--
-We must go now, quickIy.
-Yeah. Yes, sir.
-I think you know!
-Oh, you sick bastard!
-I am what you made me! Know what?
-What?
-I couId go right now.
-Then go. Go!
-I did?
Yes. PIus which, you've got this,
I don't know, this squirmy quaIity...
...you bring to the character
I couIdn't have imagined.
Here's what we're gonna do:
Come back tomorrow
going now. But you know what?
More. More. Can you do that?
Sure. I don't have time to say
thank you because I reaIIy gotta go!
Look at that! StiII in character.
I Iike him.
I pIant seeds. I can't expIain it.
-Putting on the sneakers...
...to get in the young mindset,
see if it sparks anything.
-Oh, anything yet?
-Yes, how's this?
''They're so uncomfortabIe, it's Iike
what I'm doing.
No, that seems about right.
Yesterday at my audition, I had to pee.
ApparentIy, that makes me a good actor.
I got a caIIback, so I'm drinking
everything. Oh, by the way...
...that eggnog in our fridge was great!
-Joey, that was formuIa.
suggest these to RaIph Lauren.
Okay, first of aII, that's stupid.
Second, I'm not aIIowed to taIk to RaIph.
AII right. I feeI younger aIready.
Yeah, I think I broke my hip.
-Hey, you!
-Hey.
Hey. How was cIass?
No one asks me that. What's wrong?
-Nothing. I reaIIy want to know.
discussion about the PIeistocene--
AII right, nothing is worth this.
I have a confession to make.
Okay, you know that girI that
mugged you when you were a kid?
What are you taIking about?
It wasn't a girI. It was this huge dude.
He had a pitchfork and a sword.
You don't have to Iie anymore.
-Yes, it was.
You don't think I wouId have defended
myseIf against a  -year-oId--?
-''Give me your money, punk!''
-Oh, my God, it was you!
I can't beIieve it. You mugged me?
Yeah. And I'm so, so sorry, Ross.
about it, it's kind of neat.
I mean, weII, it's just that I've
aIways feIt kind of Iike an outsider.
You know, the rest of you have
connections that go way back...
...and, you know, now you
I don't know what to say.
There's nothing you can say! That was
the most humiIiating thing ever.
-Even more humiIiating than--
-Let's not do this!
And then, at the end of the commerciaI,
out with each other.
That's interesting.
Just one thought
You didn't mention the shoes.
Who's next? ChandIer.
You start with a guy
putting on the shoes.
-He's about my age.
and he starts to Iose controI.
Maybe he faIIs.
Maybe he hurts himseIf.
Just then, a kid comes fIying
by wearing the shoes.
He jumps over the oId guy and Iaughs.
-Thank you, sir.
Or, man who's two
years younger than me.
You see, that has a cIear seIIing point.
It appeaIs to our key demographic.
-How did you come up with that?
mindset, and stuff started to fIow.
-That is great. Good work.
-Thank you.
We'II see aII of you tomorrow.
The coId weather hurts my hip.
Hey, Ross. I know you're stiII mad at
me, but can I just taIk to you for a sec?
Sure, go ahead. Oh, sorry.
I think you'II find very exciting.
Oh, my God! ''Crap from the street!''
Look, Ross. In this box...
...are aII the things I got from mugging
that I thought were too speciaI to seII...
...or smoke.
Anyway, I was Iooking
through it, and I found...
Oh, my God!
I never thought I'd see this again.
It's aII here!
What made you save
it was reaIIy good.
And maybe it wouId be
worth something one day.
You reaIIy thought <iScience Boy</i
was worth saving?
Yeah. But you shouId know I aIso have a
Science Boy. I Iearned a Iot from him.
You're weIcome.
Wait a minute.
Did you add something to him?
Oh, yeah.
You see, the way you drew him...
...there was no way
he was ever gonna get Gravity GirI.
He Iooked Iike a Ken doII in those tights.
What's that? What are you...?
''Is that a beaker
-I can't teII you something I don't know.
-You know!
-I don't know!
-I need an answer now!
-You want an answer? The answer is....
She never Ioved me.
and you never toId me?
I can never forgive you, or myseIf. I have
nothing to Iive for. Bang! And scene!
AbsoIuteIy amazing.
-The part is yours.
-Thanks! Now I reaIIy gotta go.
No, wait! CongratuIations!
but you have no probIem ordering porn.
On a Saturday afternoon?
I was in the house!
Hey. Phoebe didn't by any
chance mention that--
She was the huge guy that
mugged you? Yeah.
I see. You didn't happen to teII--
-Everybody we know? Yeah.
I'm gonna go get Monica and ChandIer.
Monica! ChandIer!
Come over! Come over!
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!
What? What?
-Shaving?
-No, rabies.
-What's going on?
It seems Iike onIy yesterday she was...
...farting on my Iap.
Not so funny when someone
does that to you, is it?
Emma, come on. Show everybody
how you were crawIing.
I think we're distracting her.
Can this be right?
I know. God, I haven't seen
my savings take a hit Iike this...
...since I was a kid and they came up
with DoubIe Stuf Oreos.
-What happened to aII of our money?
spending more than we're bringing in.
Yeah, maybe I shouId quit
and get a job that pays.
But you're finaIIy doing something
that you Iove.
I mean, I can't ask you to give that up.
AIthough it wouId be nice if the thing
too big a deaI out of this.
We'II pay our biIIs Iate this month. Next
month we'II cut back on a few things.
And maybe we start eating
out of Joey's refrigerator for a change.
You're a chef. What can you make
some money from my parents.
Or, you sIipped on ice at their house
Iast month. Can we sue them?
No, and we're not borrowing money.
-Why not?
-We don't do that. We are Bings.
If there's one thing my father
before going into the pooI house.
-The other thing is, never borrow money.
-I had no idea you had this much pride.
That's right, I do. I am your man.
I'm gonna get us through this situation...
...even if it means you working

-Okay, weII, that's bad. Yeah.
But don't you think it might be

Except for once in the ocean.
Look, it's not about who I wouId marry.
I was certain the first time I got married
it'd Iast forever. I was wrong.
-But, it just--
-Look, Phoebe, it's not about you.
I just never want to get married again.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay with that? If not, maybe

I just wanted to make sure

Because if we move in
and you start changing your mind...

They're stiII okay.
But ''you Iook nice'' couId mean

And more specificaIIy, I wouIdn't
want anything to get any bigger.
-Okay.
to get any bigger, wouId you?
Don't answer that.
Just when you thought that dude

Why do you think he was so worried
about me getting bigger?
I don't know.

No, I reaIIy want to know
how you feeI about it.
-Why?
-Never.
Wow. Are you stiII gonna

-That's not how you reaIIy feeI, is it?
-No, I'm sorry.
I know it's not what you want to hear,
but I can't heIp it. I Iove marriage.
SeriousIy, you?
''Ross, the Divorcer.'' It's just cooIer.
Look, I know my marriages

And CaroI and I had some good times

Fascist.
My breasts are gonna get bigger
My ass is gonna get bigger too.
Your ass?!
And don't be surprised if her hands

-They do that?
-It's kind of a package deaI.
God, why? Why wouId you want to

If it means that much to you, I may be
abIe to get onboard with the boobs...
...but the giant ass
and the big cIown feet?
Oh, my God, ChandIer.
If you can't handIe this,
IittIe person that's shooting out of her?
What?
Joey, why did you teII ChandIer
that Monica was getting a boob job?
Because she is.
-ChandIer knows I borrowed the money.
-For your boob job.
-Joe....
nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
Hey. Hey, what do you guys think
-Better.
-Yeah?
Very cooI.
Hey, Pheebs? You know, I'm reaIIy gIad
-Yeah, you were heIpfuI.
-Yeah. No, thank you.

They are awfuIIy boxy.

But it feeIs Iike now it's my turn
I Iove you, and I wanted to Iive with you.
I want to Iive with you too.
I mean, Iet's do that.
But I don't think I can.
It was okay to move in when
I didn't know what was gonna happen.
But I can't move in knowing nothing
up first, but no.
Can we at Ieast try Iiving together? You
might change your mind about marriage.
Are you gonna change yours?
No.
Me neither.
I think I need to be with someone
who wants what I want.
But I don't want this to end.
No, I don't want it to end either.
I can't beIieve this is gonna end.
I guess I'II have my stuff picked up.
Yeah. Okay.
Okay, so....

I thought so many times about

It<i'</is a Iong story. But the things you
just said reaIIy made my day.
The fact that you<i>'</i>re here
means more to me...
...than if this room were fiIIed
to kid about.
It was just a practicaI joke between
ChandIer and me, but it<i>'</i>s over, okay?
ActuaIIy, no. Even if I had died,

-WiII you get me tickets too?
-Yeah, me too.
-Sure.
-I have an idea.
-That<i'</is a great idea!
No, thanks.
-You don<i>'</i>t wanna win the Iottery?
-Sure I do.
I aIso want to be king

...and find out what happened
-The woman just vanished!
SeriousIy, you don<i>'</i>t want in on this?
No. Do you know what your odds
are of winning the Iottery?
I mean, you have a better chance
of being struck by Iightning  times.
you<i>'</i>re gonna spend $ on the Iottery.
I mean, that<i>'</i>s such a bunch
of boo-hockey.
I<i>'</i>II ask.
''Boo-hockey''?
Oh, we think Emma<i'</is about
to start taIking...
of boo-hockey...
...gosh darn it

How do you know
When I taIk to her, I aImost feeI
It<i'</is so exciting.
I haven<i>'</i>t won anything
since sixth grade.
Pie-eating contest?
You assume because I was heavy that<i>'</i>s
the onIy way I couId win something?
No, I saw a picture
-Yeah.
-They<i>'</i>re towing your car!
-I'm parked in a garage on Morton.
They<i'</ire towing a car.
And I am seeing spots.
Ross, you don<i>'</i>t have Emma!
You were there.
-I was?
-Yes, and you taIked to her.
-I did?
-She dropped off a casseroIe.
Oh, yeah, the casseroIe Iady.
Did you come by to watch
we can aII go out to the baIcony...
...and see a night rainbow
with gremIins dancing on top of it.
Don<i>'</i>t touch the phone!
-You think he washed his hands?
-What<i'</is going on?
ChandIer<i>'</i>s supposed to find out

But out of   interns,
-Tough odds.
Iike your -state Iottery.
Yeah, Iook who<i'</is coming around!
Damn it. AII right, caII me

WeII, there<i>'</i>s two spots Ieft, right?
Yeah. I mean, I want this so much.
I wanna get one.
I want my friend CharIie
-Hey!
You are not gonna beIieve this.
I just saw my psychic...
...and she said I was definiteIy
gonna win the Iottery tonight!
I thought we couId use

A psychic and a wishbone?
Guys, give someone eIse a chance.
-AII right, who wants to do it?
-Can I?
Vegetarians never get
we don<i>'</i>t eat the meat...
...doesn<i>'</i>t mean we don<i>'</i>t Iike
to pIay with the carcasses.
AII right. Rach?
I don<i>'</i>t want that turkey smeII
aII over my hands.
-WeII, it doesn<i>'</i>t reaIIy matter.
You<i>'</i>re both wishing
for the same thing.
I can<i>'</i>t teII you what I'm wishing for,
Right. But we know
-I understand.
But you<i>'</i>re wishing
for what we think, aren<i>'</i>t you?
I'm not reaIIy comfortabIe
with these questions!
-PIease!
wish is gonna come true.
But, you guys, just in case, maybe a
genie wiII come out if we rub this Iamp.
That thing gets hot!
Ross, just keep making your jokes.
How are you gonna feeI
if we actuaIIy do win?
be us. And then how you gonna feeI?
We<i'</ire gonna be Iike, ''Everybody, Iet<i'</is

And you<i>'</i>re gonna be aII,
and I sound nothing Iike that.
I can see the headIine now
''Lottery Winners' Friend...
...FiIIed With Regret,
Eats Own Arm.''
Why wouId I eat my own arm?
throw in  bucks for you.
-Why?
-Because I know that you think...
...that the Iottery is boo-hockey...
...but we<i>'</i>re aII here, and we<i>'</i>re gonna
watch the numbers and have fun.
I mean, I<i>'</i>II pay for myseIf.
But just the fact that you want me to
have fun with you guys, that<i'</is so sweet.
Come here.
Get a room.
So now that you<i'</ire in,
what are you gonna do if we win?
To invest it?
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say, ''invest it''?
I meant, ''Be cooI and piss it aII away.''
I know! We shouId pooI aII
our money and buy the Knicks!
You wiII when I pick you
I never get picked!
I'm not sure a sports team
is the way to go.
You won't Iet me buy the Knicks?

I<i>'</i>II take this one too.
''Mommy''?
Oh, I<i>'</i>ve gotten into the habit
of caIIing RacheI...
Which I now reaIize we are not.
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough,
we shouId probabIy caII me ''Daddy'' too.
I Iike that, Daddy.
I was just taIking about RacheI.
Is Daddy getting angry?
Is Daddy gonna spank me?
WeII, that depends.
Have you been a bad--?
No, I can<i'</it.
HeIIo? HeIIo? Hey, CharIie.
Did anybody eIse hear?
What? Susan got it? How?
AII right, bye.
Dude, I'm sorry.

How are you gonna feeI when you win

PIease. If I win the Iottery,
I couIdn<i>'</i>t get rid of you for three days!
ChandIer, wouId you just teII her
what she did was wrong?
She<i>'</i>s right. You shouIdn<i>'</i>t have
bought tickets just for us.
Let me finish.
So screw you! The tickets are ours!
There<i>'</i>s the man I married.
AII right. BeIieve me,
if you win the Iottery...

No. You guys, we gotta keep

No. No, we shouId divide them up...

Hey! Hey! If anybody gets extra tickets,
-Yeah. Thanks for inventing the Iottery!
Just give them to me,
and I<i'</iII spIit them up!
Hey, hey!
God, I can<i>'</i>t take it anymore!
I'm putting an end to this!
-Okay, if she jumps, I get her tickets!
we<i>'</i>re not doing it at aII.
-Say goodbye to your tickets.
-No! No! No!
Do not come any cIoser!
Can I come a IittIe bit cIoser?
VaIuabIe things are getting squished.
-Money!
Friends.
Hey, Monica,
what about your extra tickets?
They<i>'</i>re aII in there.
-Even these five that I hid in my bra.

Okay. Good. You guys were so scared.
There is no way I was

And the wind sure made it fun.
-Phoebe, we Iost haIf of them.
-So what?
Monica, we have the winning ticket.
My psychic said I was

<iGive me a call if you want.</i
Gosh, I'm so sorry, honey.
Sorry, ChandIer.

They're giving me a romantic story

l haven't seen you this worked-up since
you did that dog-food commercial...
...and you thought you were gonna be

You wanna come down to the set
-Yeah.
You just have to promise not

-That was an honest mistake.
-Right.

Yeah, that was an awesome day.
-Hey.

You guys wanna come eat dinner

Thank you.
You haven't said anything.
Actually, l do have one small complaint.
Well, please, l welcome criticism.

What musician?
What are you doing here?
You said you had customers lined up

-Great.

...because they requested
a bunch of my songs.
Yeah, ''You Suck'' ...
...and ''Shut Up and Go Home.''
Listen, Phoebe. You know how much
l love listening to your music...
-...but....
Where are you joining us from?
-New York.
-The Big Apple.
He's wound up. We had to stop at every
maple-candy stand on the way here.
l ate all my gifts for everybody.
l'm sorry, there's no record
-Check again, please.
-l'm sorry, it's not here.
-lt's not there.
Let me get this straight. l called

She doesn't know what to say.
Just give us
the cheapest room you have.
The only thing we have available

-That's insane.
maple-candy stores on the way back...
...and if they're closed, then maybe we'll
tap a tree and make some ourselves.
Does that room have a closet
l can lock him in?
-We'll take it.
Three hundred dollars each?
''Each?'' l'm your date.
So l pay for everything
and have no sex.
Oh, life before Monica.
Dude, don't worry about it.
l know how to make your money back.
This is a nice hotel. Plenty of amenities.
We just load up on those.
we'll make our money back in no time.
-Dude, you're shaking.
-lt's the sugar. Could you hold the apple?
-Hi.
-Hey.
Joey, l gotta tell you, l have been
And the director's good.
And my costar's good.
But they're not as good as me!
You have to tell me

Me? Oh, l'm not an actress.
-All right, l can ask Monica.
of the page right here.
Okay.
Hello, Drake.
l'm surprised to see you here.
-l can't believe you married him.
-Well, what choice did l have?
He was keeping my sister in a dungeon.
So, what about us?
hold you in my arms again...
...or touch your skin or feel your lips...
...knowing l'll never make love to you?
How can l accept
that l can never kiss you again...
...when it's all l can do
not to kiss you right now?
Kiss me.
What?
Kiss me.
-Rach, it doesn't say that.
-Just don't talk.
Well, that's new.
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite .
l've forgotten a couple of things.
Could you have some complimentary
toiletries sent up to my room?
Thank you.
Okay, a toothbrush, toothpaste...
...razor, mouthwash, deodorant, floss,
that l haven't asked for already?
Yeah, go ahead,
send up some tampons.
-What'd you get?
Nice. Put it with the others.
And l also got two more apples.
We're four short of a bushel!
God, l feel so alive.
salt and pepper shakers...
-...from the restaurant.
-That's not cool.
Dude, none of this is cool.
Look, Chandler, you have to find
the line between stealing...
...and taking what the hotel owes you.
For example: A hair dryer, no, no.
But shampoos and conditioners,
Like, the lamp is the hotel's...
...but the bulbs--
Oh, you already got that.
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
-Okay, how about this?
-No, no, no.
-You can't take the remote control.
-No!
At least tell me where you hid it.
-Can l ask you a question?
-Yeah.
Have you ever had any...
...weird, romantic dreams?
Let me think.
When l was younger, l used to dream
that l got married to Mayor McCheese.
And on our wedding night,
that l wanted to kiss Joey.
Wow! You mean like
''kiss him'' kiss him?
Oh, yeah.
l mean, it was pretty intense.
-What brought that on?
l saw him do a love scene.
-A love scene? With who?
-Olivia.
Olivia?! l thought she was
marrying Connor?!
Oh, right. Real life more important.
-You think my dream means anything?
Maybe you have a thing for Drake.
Well, it was Joey reading
Drake's lines in the dream.
Of course it was. Trust me,
when it comes to psychology...
...l know what l'm talking about.
l took two psych classes in college.
You took the same class twice.
-lt was hard!
-Hi, Phoebe.
Here, Monica, look what l got to wear
when l play at your restaurant.
Wait.
Right? l think this might even class up
''The Ballad of the Uncircumcised Man.''
Phoebe...
...maybe l wasn't clear before.
l really love listening
it's sort of an upscale place.
Right, yeah, okay. l'll ask the butler
to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
Phoebe, it's not what you wear.
lt's sort of your songs.
l just don't think you should play
at the restaurant anymore.
Okay. Fine, l'll just--
l'll take the hat back.
There.
Hey, so, you guys, the funniest
for your restaurant?
Okay, we're still on that.
-l didn't say they weren't good enough.
-Then what's wrong with them?
What, they don't go with your
tiny portions of pretentious food?
-Tiny portions?
but l can't see it. l can't see it.''
-Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
-Well, it's not about quality.
Oh, really?
You wanna talk about quality?
Have you ever heard of a ''key''?
don't taste like garlic.
Yeah, there are other
ingredients, Monica.
So that's what we're doing.
When l'm in a coffeehouse bopping
along to one of your songs...
...l'm wearing earplugs.
Earplugs or cloves of garlic?
You know what?
with your music driving people inside...
...my bar sales
have gone up like crazy.
What are people having,
the garlic martini?
So you wanna hear my work story?
l'll save it.
Here's your bill.
And you still have all your lamps.
-l didn't factor in the room tax.
-Dude, don't worry about it.
l found an unattended maid's cart.
We're way ahead of the game.
-Oh, my God.
-No, but l want the pine cones.
-There's a forest right outside.
-lt's not the same.
-No, look. She's gonna see us.
-No, she won't. l'm sly.
Okay, go quick.
Thank you for a delightful stay.
My maple candy!
lt's just you. l thought someone was
The garlic's not gonna overuse itself.
-Okay, you have to stop playing now.
-Why?
The only person my playing
is bothering is you.
-Oh, yeah? Let's settle this. Come on.
l'm the head chef here.
Okay, l was actually expecting
a little applause there, but whatever.
Quick question.
By a show of hands...
...how many of you were bothered
when you spit in my guitar case.
Okay, okay. How many of you
enjoyed the music outside?
Let me ask you this question.
How many thought the music was fine...
...but not in keeping with the tone
tone as ''pretentious-comma-garlicky''?
Okay, who thinks the food is delicious
and a little pretension never hurt anyone?
Okay, well, all right, who thinks
the food is fine, the music was fine...
...but your evening was ruined
her restaurant being fancy...
...that she made a big deal about
her friend playing her music...
...and feels really bad about it now?
Well, who was so stupid
and stubborn...
...that she lashed out
is pretty great?
-l'm sorry.
-l'm sorry too.
Hey, you wanna stick around
and l'll whip you up some dinner?
Yeah, as long as it's free.
The food here is ridiculously overpr--
Who hopes the hand-raising thing is still
-Hey.
Joey, do you have peanut butter
on the back of your head?
Oh, man. l thought l got it all.
How...?
How?
l was making a peanut butter
smoothie, right?
l couldn't find this little plastic thingy
how important can that be?'' Right?
Turns out, very.
Wow, definitely just Drake.
-What?
-How's it going with Drake?
-l don't think it's going very well.
-What?
That scene l saw was so good.
Well, l'm feeling really insecure
you're bad so l'll give you a compliment?
A little.
No, l really am worried. l have to make it
convincing that l'm in love with Olivia.
-So?
-So l've never played that.
Oh, honey, it can't be that hard.
a little awkward.
l'm just gonna blow past it.
Well, look, can't you just use
that method-actor thing...
...where you use your real-life memories
to help you in your performance?
What the hell are you talking about?
All right, look, just try to remember
when you're playing the scene.
Okay. Yeah, l think l can do that.
Yeah. Okay, there's this
party scene coming up.
And Olivia and her husband are there...
...and all Drake wants to do is
grab her and kiss her, but he can't.
That makes me think about those times
just pretend everything was cool...
...but really it was killing me.
Joey, you never
talked about that before.
Hey, you know what else l could use?
There's this scene where Drake
sneaks into Olivia's bedroom...
...and she doesn't know he's there,
but he just wants to look at her.
You know?
And l remember all those mornings
before you even put on your makeup...
...when l would think to myself,
''My God, she is beautiful.''
And it hurt so much because
looking at you.
Thanks, dude. This is great!
l got you something from Vermont.
Besides tampons and salt?
Oh, my God.
Maple candy. That's so sweet of you.
That's weird, it's empty.
Hi, you guys. What's going on?
You guys wanna hang out or...?
Do you guys hear a buzzing?
[ENGLlSH]
Hey, you guys?
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Oh, weII, Iet me see.

We can vote. We can work.
What more do these broads want?
WeII, you guys wiII have a great time.
I promise.
What? How come you don't have to go?
I wish I couId, but I found out...
...that I have to be at work reaIIy earIy
and invite whoever you want.
Let's see. Who do I hate?
Oh, sorry.
-Oops, sorry.
-Okay.
-Okay.
-Okay. Up we go.
-Oh, gosh, okay!

...and not have it be a big deaI?
No, I don't think that ever works. Why?
-No reason.
-No, no. RacheI?
-Who do you want to fooI around with?
-Nobody! Forget it.
Joey?
Maybe.
-You can't.
a word you just said.
-In the haII.
-Okay.
-You wanna fooI around with Joey?
-Yeah.
Ever since I had that dream about him,
PeopIe do it aII the time.
Who do you know that are friends
that just fooI around?
Okay. Off the top of my head....
Don and Janet.
-Who are they?
-No, just one of them.
Which one?
I don't know.
What were the names I just said?
No, RacheI, things couId get
incredibIy compIicated.
AII right. You're right. I won't do anything
one pound of baking soda and a red onion?
What the heII are you cooking?
You guys won't beIieve
what I have to do for work today.
Yes, but, Ross, you chose a career
of taIking about dinosaurs.
There are these two professors
and show them around campus.
What's so bad about that?
I just know they'II be
a coupIe of oId windbags...
...wearing tweed jackets
with suede eIbow patches.
Ross?
What? These aren't suede.
Excuse me. I'm Iooking for someone.
You don't, by any chance,
That's nice.
It's good to meet you.
Thank you so much for taking the time
to show me around.
No, it's no big deaI.
If I weren't doing this, I'd just,
you know, be at the gym working out.
Is he gonna introduce us?
I think we're just bIurry shapes
I reaIIy enjoyed your paper...
...on the connection between geographic
isoIation and rapid mutagenesis.
I wrote that in one night.
Twenty bucks says they're married
within the month.
WeII, we shouId probabIy get going.
You know, we've got a Iot
supposed to come with us?
I don't think so.
I'm pretty sure.
A Professor Spafford from CorneII?
WeII, he's obviousIy Iate,
and the ruIe in my cIass is
If you can't come on time,
-We shouIdn't wait for him?
You know what, he's a big boy.
I'm sure he'II find us, okay?
-Professor GeIIer?
-Oh, damn it!
<i>Can you give me a call? Thanks. Bye.</i>
What's happening?
It's a reaI shame you can't make it
to that one-woman show tonight.
I'd Iove to, but I gotta get up
so earIy the next day.
-You know me, work comes first.
<i>Can't wait for your party tonight.</i>
Stupid Jan Rogers!
You are having a party tonight?
-No.
-Joey!
Yeah.
I'm kind of having a thing
And you weren't gonna teII us?
How did you think you were
to that pIay, to get rid of us!
Yeah.
Last year is that why you sent us
to that MedievaI Times restaurant?
Yeah.
And the year before that, you set up that
nighttime tour of that button factory?
I can't beIieve you guys went
to your parties?
You're fine, okay? But everyone eIse acts
Iike an idiot around famous peopIe.
WeII, then, so just invite me.
PIease, I was trying to be nice.
You're the worst one.
Joey, come on! PIease, pIease?
-Okay, fine. You can come.
But don't teII anybody eIse.
It's up on the roof at .
A soap-opera roof party?!
I'm going to a soap-opera roof party!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
And it's out of my system.
And then my wife and I went
you wouIdn't beIieve.
There were cIams and musseIs
and oysters...
...and cracked crab...
...and snow crab...
...and king crab.
It's a pity I'm aIIergic to sheIIfish.
So where did you get
your undergraduate degree?
-And that's not aII I'm aIIergic to.
and cashews...
...and aImonds and fiIberts--
So basicaIIy aII nuts!
InterestingIy, no.
You're kind of pIaying it fast and Ioose
with the word ''interesting.''
If you'II excuse me,
I'm going to use the restroom.
When I come back,
of animaI dander I'm aIIergic to.
Oh, my God!
I've Iost the wiII to Iive.
-Let's ditch him.
-What?
WhiIe he's stiII in the bathroom.
I am begging you.
Okay. Okay, fine,
but he might pee fast. Okay, Iet's move!
-We actuaIIy managed to saIvage the day.
-Yeah, we did.
Thanks for spending
so much time with me.
I'm so Iucky it worked out
and my sister, Monica.
-Hi.
-CharIie wiII be joining my department.
-You're a paIeontoIogist too?
-Yeah.
Oh, okay. Now, what do you think...
...of Renyard's new theory of species
but he does have some interesting ideas.
Oh, I'm sorry. I have to take this.
Excuse me.
Renyard's theory of species variegation?
I saw the articIe on your coffee tabIe.
I memorized the titIe to freak you out.
So did you two have fun?
Oh, my God. She's great.
We have so much in common,
but she's a hottie!
Hi!
Hi, you guys. Listen, you know what,
I'm not feeIing reaIIy weII...
...and I don't think I'm gonna get
to go to the pIay.
ReaIIy? What's wrong?
I don't know.
on TV this morning...
...about NewcastIe disease,
and I think I might have it.
NewcastIe disease is
a secretion-borne virus...
...that onIy affects chickens
She's a coIIeague.
Hi. WeII, I wouId shake your hand...
...but I'm sure you don't want
to get my chicken disease.
-RacheI, can I see you for a second?
-Sure.
You're not sick.
What? Yes, I am!
Okay, then why are you aII dressed up?
When you're sick, you do whatever
so you can make a move on Joey.
No, I heard you before.
That is so not what this is.
Okay, then what is this?
Okay.
Joey is having a secret
And he sent you guys to the pIay
<i>Days of Our Lives</i> party up on the roof!
He didn't want you to know about it,
but I came over here to teII you.
-You came to say you were sick.
-AII right, professor or detective?
Wait, Joey's having a party,
That's why he's sending you to the pIay.
That's why he sent us to that medievaI
restaurant and to that button factory.
And that horribIe museum tour?
No, I arranged that.
Hey, you guys, I'm turning in.
Have fun.
We know about your party, Joey.
-What party?
Thanks for coming.
-Oh, my God. KyIe Lowder!
-Hi.
I Iove you!
Hey. That's why I didn't invite you.
You have to caIm down, aII right?
Just go get yourseIf a drink
My inhibitions Iowered.
Oh, my God, can you beIieve
we're surrounded by aII this?
I can bareIy controI myseIf.
Monica, you might want to remember
that you're married.
Where is ChandIer anyway?
Oh, my God! ChandIer!
Where the heII is everybody?
Chapter  : My First Period.
Hey, Joey said no autographs.
But if she's getting one,
''best wishes'' crap. I want ''Iove.''
Okay, actuaIIy, Mon, Matthew was
giving me his phone number.
Oh, man! If I had known
I was coming to this party...
...I never wouId've gotten married!
-It was nice to meet you.
-We wiII!
Look at you with aII the guys!
I guess you've forgotten aII about Joey.
Yeah, weII, I guess I have forgotten
about Joey.
And cIearIy, you've forgotten
to things Iike this often?
Come on, this is New York.
I mean, one night you're at a rooftop
party fiIIed with soap stars...
...and the next night, you're....
Who am I kidding, this is so cooI.
So it's probabIy gonna be hard
for you to Ieave Boston, huh?
ActuaIIy, I'm kind of happy to be Ieaving.
for you to Ieave Harvard.
EspeciaIIy after working with a NobeI
Prize winner Iike AIbert Wintermeyer.
ActuaIIy, AIbie is the guy
I broke up with.
-You dated AIbert Wintermeyer?
AIbert Einstein....
AIbie.
Yeah, weII, he is a briIIiant man.
You think?
I mean, you dated the guy...
...who improved the accuracy
of radiocarbon dating by a factor of  !
Yes, and whiIe that is everything
It's just that this must be...
...what reguIar peopIe experience
when they watch <i>Access Hollywood.</i>
Okay, you want the dirt?
AIbie was seriousIy insecure.
He was reaIIy intimidated by the guy
I dated before him.
Who's intimidating to a guy
Benjamin Hobart?
Yeah, for three years.
Oh, my God.
Have you ever been in a reIationship with
someone who hasn't won the NobeI Prize?
No.
But there was
my first boyfriend, BiIIy.
Oh, yeah? No NobeI Prizes for him?
No, but he did just win
my average-sized brains out.
What's the matter?
She onIy dates geniuses
and NobeI Prize winners.
Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurant
earIier today...
...I put chopsticks in my mouth
Your brains are smaIIer than mine!
I can't compete with the guys
she goes out with.
They're so out of my Ieague.
Oh, my God!
-Worse?
-Oh, much, much worse.
I did my impression of Joan Rivers
-No.
What?
Come on! I think that's funny!
WooIIy mammoth.
It's good!
I bet you're thinking that now wouId be
a great time for an intermission, huh?
Oh, yes. God, yes.
WeII, you're not gonna get one!
Because in Iife, there are
no intermissions, peopIe!
Now, Chapter :
Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
-Nice to meet you.
-So, what show are you on?
I'm not an actor.
I'm a professor of paIeontoIogy.
That's science.
Hey, weII, Iisten,
a NobeI Prize.
Ross, Dirk was wondering about the woman
you brought and if you guys are together?
WeII, no, but....
I mean, she onIy goes out
with reaIIy, reaIIy smart guys.
Hey, I got a  on my SATs.
I'd Iead with that.
That's it. Just sign right on the bra.
Monica!
Don't worry, Joe.
their phone numbers.
Oh, reaIIy? Let me see.
Damn, that's a Iot of guys.
Are you a IittIe sIutty?
I think I am.
Let me see if I approve
of any of these cIowns.
-This guy wears a rug.
-WeII....
This guy's Canadian.
Oh, and this guy is in a cuIt, okay?
It'II cost you $ to get to IeveI three,
-WeII, nothing major.
It's just that, you know,
they're not reaIIy good enough for you...
...and you deserve the best.
Joey, you're so sweet.
It's true, but it doesn't matter. I aIready
know who you're going home with.
Who?
Me.
What?
ReaIIy?
Yeah, because we Iive together.
-You're funny, Joey.
Oh, my God.
So how did you enjoy the pIay?
Oh, my God.
Honey, I am so, so, so, so sorry.
WeII, you shouId be.
You missed the most powerfuI
three hours in the history of the theater.
-You reaIIy Iiked it?
I've been trained not to Iisten!
But after Chapter  
Fat, SingIe and Ready to MingIe...
...I was upIifted.
-Oh, reaIIy?
-Oh, yeah.
I had no idea the amazing journey
you go through as a woman.
TeII me--
Very difficuIt.
Hey, Ross? So Iisten,
about you and the dinosaur girI?
Are you reaIIy just gonna Iet
a coupIe of NobeI Prizes scare you off?
What is that?
but she aIso broke up with them.
Maybe she's Iooking to, you know,
sIum it with some average Joe Ph.D.
Yeah, maybe, and I do have
my whoIe career in front of me.
I mean....
I couId stiII win a NobeI Prize.
AIthough the Iast two papers
You are sweet and kind and funny.
And sexy.
Okay, weII, give her a chance
to see aII that.
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.
-Thanks. I'm gonna go find her.
-Good for you.
And your paper on punctuated equiIibrium
I've changed my mind.
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna kiss Joey.
No! You can't!
Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
PIease! What about you and ChandIer?
That's different. I was drunk and stupid.
WeII, heIIo?
What about aII the guys that you got
-I couId...
...but I don't want to.
I want to kiss Joey.
AII right. I think it's a big mistake,
but it's your decision.
I'm gonna do it.
-And I can't stop you?
the phone numbers.
Hey, Rach, have you seen
CharIie anywhere?
I'm smarter than him!
Hey, thank you so much
for these tickets, ChandIer.
This was a reaIIy important experience
Enjoy your sIow death.
ENGLISH
lt's so weird. How did Joey
end up kissing Charlie last night?
-l thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
-l thought l'd end up kissing Charlie too.
But surprise!
l missed most of the party.
Charlie's a girl, right?
Yeah, she's this new professor
Of all the girls at the party, God!
-Why do you care so much?
-Yes, Rachel. Why do you care so much?
Because Ross is the father of my child.
You know, and l want him
to hook up with lots of women.
All l'm saying is, l don't think that Joey
a shared interest in each other's tonsils.
Wow. Joey and a professor.
Can you imagine if they had kids?
And if the kids got her intelligence...
...and Joey's raw sexual magnetism...
...those nerds would get laid!
All right. So, Ross, you're
okay with all this? l mean....
lt's no big deal.
-Okay.
-So a professor, huh?
-Yeah. She is cool. And she's so smart.
Her mind is totally acrimonious.
Guess that's not how she used it.
l feel like l owe you an explanation.
l don't ordinarily go around
kissing guys at parties.
l'm....
Well, l'm kind of embarrassed.
l don't think less of you.
l mean, you saw someone you liked
and you kissed them.
Those people who like someone
and don't kiss them...
...those people are stupid.
from the guys l usually date.
They're all professors, intellectuals.
Paleontologists mostly.
-You know, very cerebral--
-Yeah, l know the type.
lf we want to grab a bite before work,
-Hi.
Hey, you guys.
Look what l just got.
Oh, wow! l love those!
Where did you get them?
l bought them off eBay. They used
to this new spa in SoHo.
You can't show Phoebe this.
She hates those corporate massage chains.
What, now l can't get a massage?
There are so many things
that she disapproves of.
l can't eat veal. l can't wear fur.
l can't go hunting.
-Do you want to go hunting?
these big massage places.
They're putting people like me
out of business.
She wants to go hunting too!
Phoebe, come on,
l don't want to waste it.
lt would be like throwing
destroying our hearts...
...and leaving us hollow shells.
l don't care about any of that.
Well, do you care about friendship?
l feel really strongly about this.
Please don't use this gift certificate.
l'm asking you as a friend.
Oh, not as a friend. Phoebe!
Fine. l won't use it.
-Promise?
-Well, l am going hunting.
Hey, honey. l missed you today.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Hey.
-What do you wanna do tonight?
-Oh, well, maybe we could....
Okay, trying to turn me on
those fertility tests.
Until then, you need to keep
your tadpoles in the tank.
Do we really need to take those tests?
l don't like the words they use,
you know?
They're so clinical.
to have a baby for a year.
l think it's a good idea
to find out if everything's okay.
-Just a few routine tests.
-But l don't want to do it in a cup.
-What is the big deal?
in a doctor's office...
...but it is okay to do it in
a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
l cannot believe Ross told you that.
And in my defense, it was a Wendy's.
Look, l don't want to do
these tests either.
But l really do think
can't be worse...
...than on a class trip
to the Hershey factory.
Oh, yeah! Rachel talks too!
Who says wine has to cost
more than milk?
-Hey!
-l'm good.
-Can l offer you a drink?
-Please.
l have been crazed all day.
l had a meeting with the dean,
my syllabus for summer school's due...
...and l'm writing the foreword
Today l had to open a door and go
So l am just so excited to be here.
-l can't wait to explore the city.
-lf you need a tour guide....
Oh, you mean it?
That would be so fun.
Oh, yeah, definitely. Definitely. Okay.
at Avery Fisher Hall.
Okay.
There's a collection of Walt Whitman
letters on display at the public library.
l know.
-But first, l have to see the Met.
-Okay, let me stop you right there.
The Mets suck, okay?
You wanna see the Yankees.
No. No, not the Mets.
-Hello. Welcome to Lavender Day Spa.
How may l help you?
Hi. l have a massage appointment
under Rachel Greene.
-Okay.
-And here is my gift certificate.
-This has been torn up.
as your massage therapist is ready.
-Okay.
-Have a seat through the glass doors.
-Through the glass doors.
-Through the glass doors.
All righty then.
Phoebe, your next client's
when they're not around?
Oh, no. No, no.
Listen, is there someone
who can fill in for me?
-Sorry. Everyone is booked.
-That woman can't know l work here.
She's a friend of mine
these massage chains are.
-Then why do you work here?
-Because it's good money.
But that doesn't change the fact...
...that this is an evil,
bloodsucking corporate machine.
Well, l think this is a great place
-Hi.
l need to talk to you about Charlie.
Oh, do you? Do you really?
Yeah, l'm kind of having
a little problem.
Look, if you don't know what the word
''acrimonious'' means, just don't use it.
Look, you know Charlie, right?
-She's cool, funny, her body is so--
than all the girls l've ever dated.
Combined.
You know? And l just--
l don't want her to think l'm stupid.
Are you wearing two belts?
Hey, what do you know?
You were saying you didn't want
to seem stupid.
Well, she wants to go
that stuff. You gotta help me out.
l don't want to get involved
in your guys' relationship.
Oh, dude, please. Come on,
you're the smartest person l know.
And l really like this girl, okay?
-Thanks.
Okay. Let's see.
-Oh, you should take her to the Met.
-The Mets.
No, no, no. The Met.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Oh, that's what she meant.
lf they're gonna shorten it, they
and avoid all the confusion.
Yeah, most days the place is packed
with confused, angry baseball fans.
Okay. All right,
so l'll take her to the Met.
Yeah. Okay. There's this great
She loves architecture.
You should take a walk down Fifth
to the St. Patrick's Cathedral.
And there, there's this great
little pastry shop that she'd love.
Jeez. Sounds like you
-Okay, slow down.
You're going way too fast.
Okay? Just go back to the Met.
So you gotta tell me exactly
what to do there.
When you walk into the museum,
up to the Byzantine Empire.
Okay. So l walk in the door
and make a right.
l have a weird feeling about
this place. How do l know...
...they won't secretly videotape me
in the sweetest way possible...
...nobody's gonna wanna watch that.
Mr. Bing? Here you are.
Go into that room and deposit
your specimen into the container.
Deposit my specimen?
l usually have to call a  number
for that kind of talk.
Thanks. Got it.
All right. Honey, my tests
-Yeah, l guess.
Look, l know this is embarrassing,
but nobody cares.
No one here even knows you.
Oh, my God!
Oh, come on!
How great is this?
We're probably fertile. Let's go home.
Why are you here?
Sid and l are trying again
and we had trouble last time--
No, no, no. l mean, why?
because they have to do it in a cup.
Oh, they gave you the kiddie size.
What?
This was fun. But l've got
an invasive vaginal exam to get to.
l'd love to stay
but l've got a hot date.
Please go. Just let me know
from a real Swedish person.
Okay, then l'm Swedish.
So, what's your name?
lt's a normal Swedish name.
lkea.
-Wow. What an interesting name.
-Yeah.
-You know, l--
-Time for your scalp massage.
Wow. l really love your--
-ls something wrong?
What's the capital of Sweden?
Stockholm.
Damn. l wish l knew
if that was right.
Note the painterly lines
and subtle impasto on this canvas.
Monet painted quickly,
what you just said?
No, no. My mouth says the words,
my brain is thinking ''monster trucks.''
Now, remember,
when you get to the museum...
...Monet is not spelled M-O-N-A-Y.
-Phonetically?
Yeah, that means--
We just don't have time for this.
l gotta say, l'm really impressed you
were able to memorize all this so quickly.
l'm an actor.
-No idea.
But the guy l said it to
dies in the next scene...
...so l guess it means,
''You'll get eaten by a bear.''
Okay.
-So let's move on to the Renaissance.
of the central figure.
Touch it. lt's really bumpy.
No, no, no. No ad-libbing.
And, dude, you can't touch the paintings.
-Come on.
-No. No!
My specimen's in the room.
l just want to thank whoever knocked
so this is like a vacation for him.
So did you do it?
Did you make your deposit?
-Yeah. The hard part's over.
-That's not the hard part, honey.
No, there's talking to you,
Aren't you worried about the results?
l mean, oh, when Sid and l did this
last time, my God, l was a mess.
l haven't even thought
about the results.
l just assumed everything
we can't have a baby?
Chandler. Look, you and Monica
are meant to have children.
l'm sure it's gonna be just fine.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. l can't
believe l didn't even think of that.
l guess l was so worried about
in a Taco Bell parking lot...
...but you can't do it
at a doctor's office?
lt was a Wendy's!
And that's the Swedish national anthem.
Thank you for asking.
Wow, lkea.
What a rich culture.
You know what?
-<i>Ja</i>. She's not very good, though.
-And why do you think that is?
-l don't know.
Maybe it's because she's got
such callousy fingers...
...from playing crummy guitar.
Or maybe she has trouble
a high-maintenance tight-ass.
-Phoebe!
-You know it's me?
Well, for like a half an hour!
Man, you can lie about Sweden!
How can you come here?
-Why didn't you tell me you work here?
-l don't have to tell you everything!
You do if you're gonna make me feel
about working here?
Because l was ashamed, okay?
l sold out for the cash.
And they give me benefits, like medical
and dental and a four-oh-wunk.
But, you know, you pay a price.
if you hate it so much...
...you should walk out there
right now and quit.
Be true to what you believe in.
Honey, you have principles,
and l so admire that.
l don't have any.
You know what? You're right.
-Good for you, Pheebs.
lf you guys have microphones in
there too, l didn't mean any of that.
l love you.
Got you! Die! Die! Die!
Respectfully, Professor R. Geller.
-Hey.
-Hi.
Hey, how was the Met?
The museum was amazing.
Yeah, Joey really knows his art, huh?
Not so much, no.
He had clearly memorized
even make any sense.
-What do you mean?
-Well, for one...
...he was talking about paintings
that were nowhere around.
Wait a minute. When you guys walked
-Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey.
Still, it seems like you guys
are having a great time together.
Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.
What?
Actually, Joey's your friend...
...and you don't know me that well.
lt'd be weird.
Well, l mean, a little.
isn't the right guy for me right now.
You know, maybe l should
be with someone...
...l have more in common with.
You know what l mean?
Yeah.
Yeah, but you know what?
l think you should give Joey a chance.
l mean, he's a great guy.
And sure, he doesn't know
that with someone else.
-l guess that's true.
-lf you think about it...
...he memorized all that stuff because
he thought it was important to you.
You know, that's the kind of guy
-Yeah. Let's go.
Wow!
-Thanks, Ross.
-Yeah.
Hey, Ross. That art stuff worked.
You hooked me up.
Glad l could help, man.
Some of the stuff wasn't where you said
by this now.
Hello?
Oh. Hi, Dr. Connelly.
No. Well, she's not here...
...but l can tell her.
Should l be sitting down for this?
Well, so, what does that mean?
Okay. Okay, thank you.
Thanks.
Hey, sweetie.
Dr. Connelly just called.
With good news?
Of course it's not good news.
You said, ''Dr. Connelly just called.''
lf it was good, you'd have said,
''Dr. Connelly just called!''
So, what is it? ls it...?
ls there a problem? ls there
have low motility...
...and you have
an inhospitable environment.
Well, what does that mean?
lt means that my guys won't
get off their Barcaloungers...
...and you have a uterus that is
-Wait, Chandler.
lt means that we can keep trying...
...but there's a good chance
this may never happen for us.
Oh, my God.
l'm sorry.
l'm sorry too.
Well...
...we're gonna figure this out.
l know.
-Good morning, Phoebe.
-Good morning, receptionist.
Here's your schedule for the day.
Son of a bitch! She came back?
Are you ready
for your Scottish massage?
Put your face in the hole, lassie!
[ENGLlSH]
Oh, that feels so good.
Oh, lucky me.
Coffee and a live sex show.
-l'm sorry, what?
-From <i>Cosmo</i>?
Yeah. Yeah, it's
''Climax Your Way to Better Skin.''
So l have to go shopping today,
which is my least favorite thing.
l'm so bad at picking out clothes.
So you need someone who knows
fashion to tell you what looks good.
Not me. Not me. Not me.
-Oh, hey, Rach?
-Oh, well....
-l'm sure you have better things to do.
-You kidding?
Rachel loves to shop,
and she has great taste.
She's the one that taught me not
on underwear when trying on clothes.
lf you have the time,
l'd really appreciate the help.
Okay. Yeah, let's shop.
Okay, you are gonna come back
with some very classy clothes.
And some slutty lingerie. Slutty!
Okay, great. All right, bye.
Pain in the ass!
-That's off, right?
a party tonight and he's gonna be there.
She was like, ''Don't worry. l asked him
and he's totally okay with seeing you.''
So now l have to go so he'll think
that l'm totally okay with seeing him.
-Which you're not. You're hung up on him.
so you have to look fabulous.
l didn't even think about that.
Sexual politics!
Pheebs, l'm taking Charlie shopping.
-Come and l'll help you find something.
-That'd be great.
Oh, isn't that nice? The three of you,
trying on slutty lingerie together.
-That's not what we're gonna do.
a very pretty face.
l still can't believe this. My uterus
is an inhospitable environment?
l've always tried so hard
to be a good hostess.
l can't believe my sperm
seemed to be in a hurry to get places.
-Hi there.
-Hi.
l'm sorry there wasn't better news
from your tests last week...
...but l wanted to talk to you
through natural means aren't great...
...you never know,
so keep having sex on a regular basis.
Oh, damn it!
Don't worry.
After a while, you'll tune it out.
Given your situation, the options
or insemination using a sperm donor.
lf you feel that neither of those is
right for you, you could always adopt.
ls that a hint?
Because we love you, Dr. Connelly,
but we don't want you to be our child.
Wow! Talk about
Phoebe and go shopping?
-Let's do it.
-All right, have a good time.
Not gonna find any clothes in there.
-Hey, you guys.
-Hi.
Guess who's up for keynote speaker
-Yeah, right.
When was the last time he made
a submission deadline for an abstract?
Why are you laughing?
Just seeing what it'd be like
to be a paleontologist.
lt's fun. Yeah.
So you're up for keynote speaker?
-Who's deciding?
-He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
l think l know how to dazzle him.
You're not gonna to do
a magic trick, are you?
No.
-Hey, guys.
-l want to ask you something.
l may get to speak
to come and hear me.
l think l can safely say that we all have
family issues, work and/or are sick.
-lt's in Barbados.
-But you come first.
l'm there.
-l don't know Ross, l'm not feeling too--
-Okay, bye.
-Bye. See you.
-Bye.
-So how did it go at the fertility clinic?
-Not as much fun as last time.
Apparently, you only get porn
her whole life of carrying a child...
...and she just felt that watching
a surrogate would be too hard for her.
-So you're ruling out surrogacy?
-Yeah.
So l don't have to learn
other choice is insemination...
...so we're talking about sperm donors.
Enough said. l'm there for you, man.
Where is she, upstairs?
Your long-standing offer to have sex
with my wife is appreciated.
-But l think l'll pass.
to have a child, but there isn't one.
Come on, Ross, be a good guy.
Step up and do it.
What?
What?! No!
l'm not gonna give them Ben!
The data we're receiving
Leakey's dates as a given.
But if they're off
by even a  , years or so...
...then you can just throw
most of our assumptions...
...you know, right in the trash.
So, what l'm saying is....
ls that....
ls that repercussions could be huge.
l mean, not just in paleontology,
genetics, geology.
l mean, truly, the mind boggles.
Well, that's not what you want.
-lncentive for Men?
-l'll take some of that.
-Pheebs, that's for men.
-l know.
When l go to the party later...
...Mike will know l'm over him
a Russian cabdriver.
Seriously, does anyone buy this?
l smell like beets.
l really like those jackets with the
shoulder pads in them. Where are those?
l think what you want is over here.
See, l told you l needed someone.
By the way, as a thank you,
-Joey and l are going to a movie tonight.
-You want to come?
-Oh, l can't.
Because l've seen them.
You've seen all the movies?
Yeah. l'm a big fan.
Of the movies.
You know, motion pictures.
The talkies.
Rach, will you come with me
to a dressing room?
-Sure.
l've done a lot of stuff.
So, what were you doing out there?
Do you not like Charlie?
She's okay. l don't know, l just don't
get a really good vibe from her.
-Why?
she waltzed in here all smart...
...and tall, you know...
...and just swept Joey off his feet.
Nobody else has a chance.
-Who else?
-Anybody.
You. Me.
You know, Monica's mom.
You like Joey?!
Phoebe!
All right, look, l do.
-lt's just physical.
l have it totally under control, okay?
lt's just when l see them together...
...sometimes, l just get a little jealous.
Wow. lsn't that ironic
that he liked you, and now you like--?
l get it!
All right, as long
He's already dating her.
She is a nice person.
That wouldn't be right.
l know, l know.
So it's just not a big deal.
-So can we keep this between us?
The smell of beets is killing me.
Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
-Hi, honey.
-Hey.
l brought a friend home for dinner.
This is Zack from work.
Oh, of course. lt's so nice
-You guys haven't actually met before.
But, boy, you're both polite.
Have a seat. l'll get you a beer.
-l got it.
-Thanks.
-So Zack's pretty nice, huh?
-Yeah, l guess.
So how would you like to have a baby
and Zack may be the guy.
Look. He's intelligent, he's healthy,
he's athletic. l mean, he's sperm-tastic!
Chandler, this is crazy.
Well, what did you even say to him?
''Come up. Meet my wife.
a chance to get to know him.
With a sperm bank, you never
meet the guy, get to check him out.
-Chandler!
-l'm telling you, he's great.
l mean, even if my sperm worked fine,
and expect him to be our sperm donor.
Okay.
-Zack?
-Thanks.
Do you have a coaster?
l don't want to make a ring.
Tell me about yourself, Zack.
Oh, God, do you think she heard?
dressing room and talk. You stay here.
-See if you can hear me.
-Okay, great.
Oh, thank God,
l can't hear a word that you're saying.
-l didn't say anything yet.
on the phone to talk with my friends.
What?
Well, some things are just hard
to say to your face.
Okay, well, l heard that.
Which means that she heard it too.
-We have a problem.
put babies on the phone.
All right, enough out of you!
Thank you.
Where did l go wrong? This is good stuff.
-Hello?
-l need to talk to Charlie. ls she there?
No, she went shopping with Rachel.
Why? What's up?
l'm meeting with Professor Sherman
-lt could be better.
He fell asleep.
What? But l already bought
my ticket to Bermuda!
-Barbados.
-Fine, l'll rent a car and drive.
You have to get that job.
What am l supposed to do?
in his sleep before...
...and evidently he wants someone
named Fran to ''spank him harder.''
-Well, just wake him up.
-l can't.
lf he realizes that l'm the one who
This happened to me before.
Yeah, l was auditioning for a play,
and the producer fell asleep. l--
No, wait a minute.
lt was me who fell asleep.
l mean, hey, Shakespeare, how about
a chase scene once in a while?
-Hey, guys, dinner's ready.
for my kid. Those eyes, those cheekbones.
Okay, there's enthusiastic,
and there's just plain gay.
-You don't like him.
-l think he's fine.
But we don't know
-All right, just follow my lead.
-You guys have a great place here.
-Thanks. l'm crazy about our place.
Hey, speaking of crazy...
...do you have a history
of mental illness in the family?
No. Although, l did have an uncle
we're looking for.
Okay.
So tell me, how'd you guys meet?
Oh, friends first, drunk in London,
you know the story.
Do you or any of your blood relatives
have diabetes?
No.
Heart disease? Alzheimer's? Gout?
You guys don't have people
l heard a joke today. lt's pretty funny.
You know what's not funny?
Male pattern baldness.
You guys have shown a lot of interest
in me tonight, and l'm flattered...
...and quite frankly, a little frightened.
Can we just talk about something else?
-Sure.
with a beautiful set of teeth.
Did you have braces as a child?
-No, l didn't.
-Yes!
We're teeth people, Zack.
Let's just do it. Let's just go
over there and see if she heard.
-Good plan.
-Oh, l'm sorry, Rachel.
l don't have time
for your childish games, okay?
l still have to find something
incredible to wear...
...so l can beat Mike
-Trying on clothes.
Oh, really? ln the dressing room?
Well, that's so weird.
Phoebe and l were in the dressing room.
Gosh, it's just such a small world.
Rachel, l heard you
Okay, look, let me explain.
There's nothing to explain.
l heard you.
Phoebe likes Joey.
Yeah.
l don't understand it.
l mean, Phoebe likes Joey...
...and then she's here to buy a dress
You know, she just wants them all.
lt's, like, she's nympho.
-Wow!
-Yeah.
You know, by the way, l heard you
tell her not to do anything.
Thanks for sticking up for me.
to be the keynote speaker?
Thank you!
You're welcome.
Wow! You look...
...stop-eating hot!
Which is like the highest level
of hotness.
Okay, are you sure? Because l am
really dreading going to this party.
Then don't go.
Mike knows l'm coming. lf l don't show up,
That's a very serious thing in my culture.
All right, then you go to that party,
and you pretend to be over Mike.
Afterward, you come to my place
and l'll get you good and drunk.
You got it. Okay.
But not on the wine
to the emergency room.
l'm sorry,
l don't seem to have enough cash.
You would accept rubles, would you?
This is a hundred-thousand-ruble note,
which is worth approximately...
...nothing.
-David?
-Hi.
Wow! You look unbelievable.
Oh, yeah, well....
What are you doing here?
Well, l'm back from Minsk.
Permanently.
Well, what happened?
Remember how l was trying
to achieve...
...the positronic distillation
l discovered...
...that it can't be done.
-Oh, l'm sorry.
-lt's all right.
This kind of thing happens
all the time in science.
To people who base eight years of research
-Good.
Well, l'm seeing someone.
-Good for you.
-Yeah.
She's also a scientist,
so she's very smart and pretty and....
lt's actually because of you
with that Mike guy...
...and l just said, ''Boy, l want that.''
-Mike and l broke up.
-You're kidding me.
Because l'm not seeing anybody.
l just totally made that up.
-Really?
to lose face.
l understand.
Yeah. Okay. So then, okay....
So we're both living in New York,
not seeing anyone.
-That's so not like us.
-Yeah, l know.
Well, this is probably a stupid question,
that you need to be right now?
Well....
No.
-Well, do you want to get a drink?
-l'd love to.
-Great.
-Okay.
Do you smell beets?
All right, stay upwind of me.
Hey, there's Phoebe.
aren't you?
Sure you don't want to stay
a little longer?
No, l should get home.
l'm kind of tired.
Are you always tired?
Because that could be
at which all my grandparents died.
-l'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.
Bye.
l think we found our sperm.
He does seem pretty perfect.
Yeah? You think so?
Should l ask him?
No.
Why not? Just because his
from you anyway.
No, that's not it.
lt's just that when we were asking him
all those questions before...
...l just realized l don't care if he
is the most perfect guy in the world.
-He's not you.
l don't want to get pregnant by him...
...or anyone else.
-Really? Are you sure?
-Yeah, l'm sure.
Thank God, because l
don't wanna do this either.
l was just doing it because l thought
l'm supposed to bring the sperm.
That is so sweet.
l love you.
So you know this leaves us with....
Adoption.
How do you feel about that?
l think l feel okay about it.
Actually, l think l feel
really good about it.
Me too.
l wanna find a baby that needs a home,
and l wanna raise it with you.
And l wanna mess it up
We're really gonna adopt?
Yeah.
-Oh, my God! We're gonna be parents!
-We are gonna be great parents.
And it could be soon.
l mean, think about it.
Right now, somewhere out there...
...our baby could be being conceived.
Wait. lf we're lucky,
the sound of a condom breaking.
Hey, Zack.
Hey, Chandler.
l wanted to apologize for last night.
l got the feeling
we made you uncomfortable.
-No, you didn't.
-Really?
No, you did.
My wife and l have
inappropriate questions.
We're working on it.
-Here are the boards for Friday's pitch.
-Thank you.
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning
on keeping her baby, would you?
[ENGLlSH]
Hey! I'm aII packed and ready to go.
That's right. Daddy and UncIe Joey
Right? Can you say, ''Barbados''?

Okay. I've gotta say, it means so much
to me that you guys are coming...
...aII the way over there
to hear me give my speech.
And I have a surprise.
to the entire conference. That's right!
These babies wiII get you into aII
the paIeontoIogy Iectures and seminars.
Do you have anything
that wiII get us out of them?
We're excited to hear the speech,
a few Iectures.
-Right, because he's a scientist.
-No, no.
He's been in Minsk for eight years.
If he gets too much direct sunIight...
...he'II die.
-Okay, we'd better go.
-AII right, Iet's do it.
A five-hour fIight with CharIie,
have a coupIe drinks...
...get under that bIanket
and do what comes naturaI.
It's a bIanket, Joe,
-Look at aII these paIeontoIogists!
I know. There are gonna be some
pasty foIks by the pooI tomorrow.
-My God, I can't beIieve you're here!
-I think I've been recognized.
-This happens aII the time.
I can't wait for your keynote speech.
-Wow! This is very fIattering.
-I wouId Iove your autograph.
WeII, sure.
-''Dear...?''
-Sarah.
''Sarah. I dig you.''
-''Dr. Ross GeIIer.''

-And this is Joey Tribbiani.
-Are you a paIeontoIogist?
No, God, no, no.
I'm an actor.
You probabIy recognize me from a
There's no ''the.''
Okay, Ross. Boy, you.... Yeah.
No, no. I pIay Dr. Drake Ramoray.
-I'm sorry. I don't own a TV.
-You don't own a TV?
What's aII your furniture pointed at?
-WeII, it was a pIeasure to meet you aII.
and I stiII haven't gotten a new one.
WeII, didn't you two come
to the right convention.
David, can you heIp me?
I'm trying to expIain to ChandIer
how a pIane stays in the air.
CertainIy. That's a combination
-See?
Yeah. That's the same as,
''It has something to do with wind.''
I'm gonna go pick up a few things
for the trip.
I shouId go too. Now, tomorrow do you
-That's right!
Oh, yeah.
Wow, I had totaIIy forgotten about him.
-That's a bIast from the past, huh?
-No, it's okay. Honest mistake.
It reaIIy doesn't mean anything.
as Richard aII the time.
-She does?
-Let's get you out of here.
WeII, at Ieast you took me down
with you.
I'm so sorry. I just--
we're having so much fun together.
Why? Why do I miss Mike? That's just--
That's gonna go away, right?
-WeII, I guess. In time.
-Yeah.
I mean, my feeIings for Richard
feeIings for ChandIer are certainIy gone.
Boy, Phoebe's stiII pretty hung up
on that Mike, huh?
I wouIdn't read too much into it.
StiII, a girI caIIs you
by her ex-boyfriend's name...
-...that's not a good thing, right?
I'm not very good at giving advice.
See, if you want advice,
go to Ross or Monica. Or Joey...
...for advice about pizza toppings
or a burning sensation when you pee.
I'm sorry, I just wish there
-SeriousIy, we're gonna do this?
I'm sorry, I just wish I couId make her
forget about Mike aIready.
-Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
-Because his penis was too big.
I'm sorry. That's the kind of thing I do.
They broke up because Mike
you'd be open to marriage?
That's great. That's great.
I'II propose to her.
What?
I was probabIy going to do it
at some point.
-No, I didn't mean now.
We'II see you at the wedding, feIIa.
WeII, we probabIy won't invite you
to the wedding, but--''
-WeII, thank you, ChandIer. SincereIy.
-WeII, you're weIcome.
GIad I couId heIp.
-How do you think I shouId propose?
Hey, how are you?
You said you were gonna wear a thong.
Where's the thong?
I didn't mean a thong.
I meant thongs.
You reaIIy shouId have been
who I just saw downstairs.
Britney Spears!
Yeah.
She never misses these conferences.
-No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
-Oh, my God!
-I know!
to Kenneth Schwartz?
You couId say, ''Hey, Kenny,
how come you're not Britney Spears?''
-You ready to go?
-You're gonna go now?
-I thought we couId hang out.
I'd Iook at his speech.
But maybe we couId have dinner Iater?
Out on the baIcony? It'II be romantic.
WiII you wear a thong?
I wiII if you wiII.
You got yourseIf a very weird deaI.

-So you gonna be okay?
-Yeah, yeah.
I got tons of stuff I couId do.
-There's an indoor pooI.
-You couId swim there.
-Yeah.
I wasn't gonna swim.
I was gonna dig a hoIe.
That Mike thing was interesting.
-I do. Want a hint, huh?
I do.
I do.
Okay, I'm sensing this is
some kind of wordpIay...
...because you are pink
with bareIy controIIed gIee.
-David's gonna propose to Phoebe.
he couId beat Mike...
...and I toId him Phoebe wanted
to get married.
ChandIer, we have taIked about this.
You are not supposed to give
peopIe advice!
CouIdn't you have made

They've onIy been going out
for a few weeks.
Phoebe is compIeteIy hung up on Mike.
I mean, she'II say no...
...David's heart wiII be broken,

Man, that's some bad advice.
Oh, hey.
Thank God. You guys are here.
-What's going on?
-Everything is upside-down here.
It rains aII day Iong and nobody

Okay. When I go pIaces

...it gets a IittIe extra body, okay?
That's why our honeymoon photos

And with mirrors on the ceiIing.
And make sure our room

I'd Iove to share this with someone.
Oh, honey, you have us. We Iove you.
Okay, which one of you

I just wish I couId share it with a guy.
-Not Joey.
-Not Joey. No.
-I was just Iusting after ChandIer.
-Yeah, right.
So.... I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight.
Tonight?
Isn't an engagement ring
pay quite as weII as you might think.
That's one-seventieth of a carat.
And the cIarity is quite poor.
Nice.
-Monica, can I taIk to you for a second?
-Okay.
David's gonna propose
to Phoebe tonight.
See what happens
-That wouId be advice!
Okay, fine. I'II handIe this.
-Phoebe?
-Yeah?
-I need to taIk to you.
-Are you Ieaving the Supremes?
Okay, my husband just gave
You want to marry him?
-What about Mike?
-Oh, okay, you want me to marry Mike?
Let's just gag him and handcuff him...
...and force him down the aisIe, okay?
I can just see it.
''Mike, do you take Phoebe?''
You know? It's every girI's dream.
Do you reaIIy think marrying
I Iove Mike-- David!
David! I Iove David.
Don't Iook at me that way,
Roseanne Roseannadanna.
''By using CT scans and computer
imaging, we can, in a very reaI way...
...bring the Mesozoic Era
of the conference.
It'II be even better tomorrow...
...because I won't be constantIy
interrupted by Joey...
...checking to see if they put
chocoIates on my piIIow yet.
-Hey, guys.
It's fantastic.
Oh, is it on the computer?
Because I'd Iove to give it a read.
If you want to check your e-maiI,
just ask.
What? May I?
What's with the rain, GeIIer? I mean,
about it being monsoon season.
-The wet season is June to December.
-It's not the time, CharIie.
Oh, no. No, no! Dear God, no!
What, did someone outbid you
for the teapot?
Secret teapot.
Your computer. I don't know what--
-Must be a virus.
I think it erased your hard drive.
What? Oh, my God. What did you do?
Someone I don't know sent me an e-maiI
and I opened it.
-Why? Why wouId you open it?
-WeII, it didn't say, ''This is a virus.''
-What did it say?
-What am I gonna do?
-My speech is gone!
-It's not gone.
I'm sure you printed out a copy.
You have a hard copy?
No, I don't!
WeII, you must be pretty mad
-Yep.
I'd Iike to thank you guys
for coming down here...
...to compIain about the rain
and ruin my career.
-I just feeI awfuI.

WeII, I tried BiIIie Jean King, but--
You know, you and Monica have
the same I'm-gonna-kiII-you Iook.
I can usuaIIy make it go away
by kissing her.
Get out.
You know, this happens aII the time
-I usuaIIy go...
...pIay Tetris on somebody eIse's
computer.
I can't beIieve this is happening.
I have to give the keynote speech

I have to stand up in front of aII
for auditions.
I don't think your monoIogue from

Ross, we can soIve this.

Don't worry about that.
I mean, Ross needs you.
RacheI and I wiII stay and heIp
any way we can.
AII right. Okay, Iet's do it.
WeII, I know we start by discussing
the defining moment...
...of the Mesozoic Era,
the breakup of Pangaea. HeIIo?
And then there's the overview
of the Triassic.
Any chance any of this happened
-<i>Okay, Mike?</i>
Enough is enough.
You Iove Phoebe, and she Ioves you.
So get over your
I-never-wanna-get-married thing...
...and step up!
Who is this?
Sure, Monica.
and she's gonna say yes...
...but I know she reaIIy wants to be
with you.
He's gonna propose?
I'm sorry, did you say something?
I can't hear through aII this damned hair!
If Phoebe wants to marry David,
Neither shouId you.
You don't teII me what to do.
I teII you what to do.
Just caII her. She's at the Paradise HoteI
in Barbados.
And whiIe I've got you,
-I hope you're happy too, honey.
Phoebe's going to say yes to David.
-That's what happens when you meddIe.
-Phoebe's gonna say yes? That's great.
No, it's not.
She's stiII in Iove with Mike.
-There's no chance that wiII work?
-MeddIer! MeddIer!
If you hadn't meddIed to start with...
...then I wouIdn't have had to go in
and meddIe myseIf.
No matter how much we meddIe,
we'II never be abIe to unmeddIe...
...the thing that you meddIed up
We couId read.
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
Hey, hey, hey, don't mind if I do.
I'm sorry, sir, these are
for the pharmaceuticaI convention.
You feeI Iike going to a convention?
-We can't. We're not pharmacists.
-I know we're not...
...but Frank Madaio and Eva....
-Kate MiIIer.
-Oh, good--
And that's the most sex
I'm gonna have this weekend.
WeII, in that case,
shouId I make sure it's on reaI good?
Thank you.
So, Kate...
...how's the pharmacy game treating you?
WeII, Frank, I teII you, it's rough.
I mean, is it me or is doctors' handwriting
we get to wear those white coats...
-...and stand behind that reaIIy taII counter.
-Oh, that's true.
You're Joey Tribbiani
FinaIIy, someone recognizes me. Okay.
-Jackie, it is him.
in a new movie about pharmacists.
Yeah, it's caIIed <iPrescription for Love.</i
-Nice.
-Yeah.
This is my friend RacheI.
She's in the movie too.
I'm an actress.
So, what's the movie about?
WeII, I pIay the handsome,
and become sexy, you know.
And there's some nudity,
but it's very tastefuIIy done.
My nudity in the fiIm
is not tastefuI at aII.
So you're doing research?
-Do you have any questions for us?
bringing the Mesozoic Era...
...into the  st century.
WeII, yeah. That's it?
That's it. That's the whoIe speech.
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God. We did it.
ActuaIIy, I did it, Ross. You remembered
shockingIy IittIe of your own speech.
Yes, but I did make a pyramid
Thank you. Thank you so much.
That's a pretty neckIace.
Thank you.
Hey, what do you say we ceIebrate?
Champagne?
Yeah! Save the cork, and that way,
we can fiII the bottIe with water...
...and put it back so they
And is this your son...
...or just some kid whose picture
you bring on vacation?
That's Ben, my son
from my first marriage.
-Your first marriage?
She was...
...gay.
ActuaIIy, it's not that compIicated.
Oh, my God.
This is so cooI!
Okay.
Odd thing to get excited about.
No, it's just that I was engaged
to a guy who turned out to be gay.
Hey! High-five!
Didn't you feeI so stupid
Iong weekends with his ''tennis partner.''
My wife had a workout friend she went
to the gym with every day for a year.
She didn't get any fitter.
-Everybody's Iike, ''I knew aII aIong.''
-I know.
If you knew, why didn't you teII me?
to say your wife's gay.''
-I know.
-And then--
And then you try to make the best
of a bad situation...
...so you fIoat the idea of a threesome.
I didn't do that.
Me neither.
WeII, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
I know. That oId Iady at the end
one. See anybody in there you Iike?
WeII, Iet's see. There was that
reaIIy big guy that I was taIking to...
...with the reaIIy nice breasts.
But what about back home? Anything
going on there? Anybody you Iike?
No.
-There is. You're bIushing.
-No. Joey.
Who do you Iike?
You're not getting away that easy.
-Who do you Iike?
-Joey, come on!
It doesn't matter, you know?
Rach, who can you not get?
Okay. Okay.
You reaIIy want to know who it is?
-Yeah. Who is it?
-Do you?
-Oh, hey.
we couId have that dinner.
Right! Of course.
Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
Yep! We got it. We got it.
Thank you so much.
-I had a great time.
because I reaIIy want to know--
Later. Later.
-So shaII we?
-Yeah.
-Okay.
-Good night.
Good night.
-Okay, good night.
say yes to David.
She's cIearIy in Iove with Mike.
You know, it's very hard to take you
seriousIy when you Iook Iike that.
CouId we have a bottIe
of champagne, pIease?
And I'm kind of on a budget,
I cannot watch this. Let's go.
I think we have time.
Have you heard him taIk?
''Phoebe, I wouId be honored if--''
Spit it out, David!
Phoebe.
You're an amazing woman, and the time
in Minsk didn't heIp.
Sure. Okay. Yeah.
But, weII, now that we're together
again, I don't ever want to be apart.
So to that end....
-Oh, my God, Mike.
-It's David, actuaIIy.
No, Mike's here.
Oh, hey, Mike.
Hi, David.
ChandIer. Monic-- Oh!
It's the humidity!
-Hi, Phoebe.
gonna ask her myseIf.
Yeah, I understand, but before you do,
she reaIIy needs to hear this.
Okay.
-WouId you care for my seat as weII?
-ActuaIIy, yeah, that'd be great.
WeII, that's fair, you've had a Iong trip.
Phoebe, I Iove you.
I've missed you so much
for a good reason...
...but I reaIized that there was
no reason good enough...
...to keep me from spending
the rest of my Iife with you.
Kind of steps on the toes
but she reaIIy has to know this.
AII right, but after this,
I want to see you outside.
If it stops raining.
You're the most incredibIe woman
I've ever met.
How couId I Iose you?
-I wouIdn't brag about that, big guy.
But, Phoebe...
...wiII you marry me?
No.
I Iove you, but I never needed
a proposaI from you.
I just needed to know
we were headed somewhere.
-That we had a future.
but that wouId've been wrong.
PIease, you don't have to expIain.
I mean, perhaps if I hadn't
gone to Minsk...
...things wouId have worked out for us,
and I wouIdn't have ruined my career.
Or Iost that toe to frostbite.
It was a good trip.
-Is it okay if I hug you now?
I couId just Iie here aII day.
Oh, I know.
-Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
-So gIad we got adjoining rooms.
-The sun is out!
-Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Go to the pooI and reserve chairs.
-I wiII get the magazines and the Iotion.
-Damn it!
WaIIs are pretty thin, guys.
''Then we have to weigh the data from
recent MRI scans and DNA testing...
...which caII into question information
gathered from years of carbon dating.''
Look at the woman sitting out
I'm so jeaIous!
''FinaIIy, factor in the profusion
of new species recentIy discovered.
<i>Giganotosaurus.</i>
-<i>Argentinosaurus.</i>''
''And that's just the herbivores. I'm not
their stunted cerebraI deveIopment.''
ReaIIy?
''But aII kidding aside,
in much the same way...
...that <iHomo ergaster</i is thought to be a
-What?
-No, he reaIIy said it.
''And whiIe there are certainIy
vast differences...
...between these Mesozoic fossiIs
the Mesozoic Era into the  st century.''
Thank you.
-ReaIIy great.
-Oh, thanks, guys.
I thought it was wonderfuI.
Jarvis OberbIau. CorneII.
I mean, the ideas you put forth,
That was reaIIy great.
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah. Oh, and so funny.
-Take it easy.
-AII right, thanks. Thanks so much.
I can't teII you how much it means
We wouIdn't have missed it.
I'm back.
Okay. WeII, excuse me?
-WeII?
-You were incredibIe.
You bIew them away.
I can't teII you how great it was
to Iook in the crowd and see your face.
I mean, did you know you were
-No, it's okay.
It made me feeI Iike a rock star.
Oh, my God. I'm your groupie.
Hey, I better not find you naked
in my hoteI room.
Look, I took it too far.
Hey, I thought you were
going to the beach.
-It's raining again.
the whoIe weekend...
...is the one hour I'm giving my speech.
Someone up there Iikes me.
But peopIe down here are pissed.
I can't beIieve it's raining again.
It's so unfair.
WeII, on the bright side,
now we won't have to see...
...aII these paIeontoIogists
-They have a game room downstairs.
They have Ping-Pong and stuff.
Ping-Pong?
Honey, they have Ping-Pong.
-Let's pIay.
-I don't think so.
-Why not?
others disagree, and I'm Iying.
-I'm not aIways that bad.
-Oh, yeah?
What happened when we pIayed
Iast time?
I punched you.
-And?
-I cIunked your heads together.
-There you are.
-Hey. Listen.
As soon as it stops raining,
we have got to go snorkeIing.
Some kid toId me about this sea turtIe.
a discussion group aII afternoon.
That's okay.
I'II find someone eIse to do it.
I'd do it aIone, but...
...I don't know what happens
if the sea turtIe catches you.
You know, I feeI so bad.
I haven't seen you this whoIe trip.
I had the best time with RacheI.
I just feIt bad for you, stuck
in that room working on Ross' speech.
ActuaIIy, it turned out to be a Iot of fun.
Oh, weII, at Ieast
we're both having fun, right?
-Is it weird that it's not with each other?
-AII right.
-I'II pIay if we don't keep score.
-WeII, then how do we know who wins?
-Nobody wins.
-So we're just four Iosers. Super.
-WeII, I'm not pIaying with her.
-Okay.
-You don't know what you're doing.
-She gets crazy.
This scar? That's from Pictionary.
I think I'II be aII right.
-You want to voIIey a bit for serve?
-Sure, if you want to.
Oh, by the way, I'm awesome.
Oh, dear God, there's two of them.
-You ready to pIay?
-No idea. I thought he was soft Iike you.
-Want to make it more interesting?
-How much you thinking?
-Ten bucks a game?
-Make it .
-I'II make it  .
You got a quarter?
No. Either of you girIs got a quarter?
Honey, try to focus the trash taIk
on him.
-Monica, you caII it.
-Heads. No, taiIs! Heads!
-TaiIs.
-Oh, no, I don't think so.
Standard ruIes If at any time a pIayer
uses his nonracket-bearing hand...
...to touch the pIaying surface,
he or she forfeits the point.
He was a Iawyer.
-Hey.
-What? Is everything okay?
-CharIie and I broke up.
No. Why?
WeII, she said
we have nothing in common.
That's crazy.
No, it's not.
-Yeah.
I mean, she shouId be with someone
more Iike Ross.
You know, I mean he uses
aII those big words too.
-Man, smart peopIe are duII.
keep going after the wrong girIs?
-What are you taIking about?
-Oh, come on.
I mean, there's you, then there's CharIie.
It's Iike.... What the heII's my probIem?
I just....
Okay. Maybe you're not
CharIie is not right for me.
-I'm not taIking about her.
-WeII, then, who?
The waitress I went out with Iast month?
-You know what? Forget it.
-No, no, no, no.
-Who are you taIking about?
I'm taIking about, so....
-Okay.
-Yeah.
WeII, I'm gonna go see
if I can get a room for tonight.
-And I'II see you Iater.
-Okay.
-Let's not make a big thing about this.
-It's a huge thing!
Okay, not working with me, Joe.
Look, here's the thing.
LateIy, I have been having thoughts.
Musings, if you wiII.
-WeII, for how Iong?
-WeII--
DiaI it down. Listen, maybe they're
crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do.
I have been thinking about,
you know, us.
-Okay, diaI it up a IittIe.
-Shoot.
-What the heII are you doing?
-I'm not trying to do anything.
It's just, we have such a good time
when we're together, you know?
And I mean, aren't you just
I mean, I'm as curious as...
...George!
-Who?
-Curious George!
You know, the monkey and the guy
with the yeIIow hat.
-Of course. I remember.
-No, I know. We're great!
But, Rach, no, this can't happen.
Can't it just happen a IittIe bit?
-No! It can't happen at aII!
-Why not?
Because, Iook, no one wants
this to happen more than me, okay?
I have gone over this moment
-I know. I know...
...but I've thought about it a Iot
since then, and it just wouIdn't be right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
-Oh, God, I shouIdn't have said anything.
-No, no.
No, no, no, no. Hey, we'II be fine.
-Like you said, it's no big deaI.
-It's so not a big deaI.
-I'II see you Iater. AII right, hey.
-Okay, great.
Okay--
Oh, I'm sorry, I think--
I think that may have missed the tabIe.
-Oh, do you?
-Yeah.
-Do you?
-Yeah!
-You reaIIy find this attractive on him?
-Oh, yeah.
Are you teIIing me you're not even
I've feIt Iike the more attractive one.
AII right, come on, Mike.
You can beat her.
Knock that dog off her head.
-Damn it!
-I sIeep with him!
-Game point.
how did that feeI, Iosing to a girI?
You shouId Iook in the mirror
before you caII yourseIf that.
-No! No! No!
-And that's how it's done.
Okey-dokey.
You've each won a game, and I've Iost
-That's what I'm thinking.
ShouId I use my invisibiIity
to fight crime or for eviI?
-Serve the baII, chump.
-''Serve the baII, chump.''
Okay, better comebacks, Mike.
I have a cabin in the Adirondacks.
If you ever want to get away
from the city, weII, that'd be...
...just nifty.
WeII, I've kind of got a Iot
on my pIate right now.
Not that I wouIdn't Iove a weekend
-Oh, you're back.
-This is my wife, Nancy.
-WeII, get out!
-Ross? Can I taIk to you for a minute?
-Yes, pIease.
Is he stiII Iooking at me?
Yes.
-StiII?
-Joey is a great guy...
...but we're just--
We're so different.
I mean, Iike, during your speech,
I knew that was him!
Anyway, I just....
-I guess.
There was....
There was another reason that I thought
it was time to end it with Joey.
I started to reaIize that I was
having feeIings for someone eIse.
Okay, GeIIer.
to the keynote speaker.
Professor KIarik, we're in the middIe
of a conversation here.
-Can't you throw him in the pooI Iater?
-Or we couId throw you both in now.
Okay, gentIemen, pIease.
We're academics...
...and most importantIy,
you wiII have to catch us first.
Go! Go! Go!
Okay, so it's tied again,
 to  .
-Okay, Iook, enough is enough.
-Monica, that was aIso true an hour ago!
I mean, pIease, Iook at you.
Your hand is bIistered, you can
bareIy stand, your hair is inexpIicabIe!
Pheebs, taIk to Mike. HeIp me out.
Mike, you win this, you wiII get the best sex
you've ever had in your whoIe Iife.
I say to fight crime.
You didn't see us!
Monica?
You've aIready proven
so Iet's just go upstairs...
...order room service, take a shower
and shave your head!
I can't just waIk away.
I've put in four hours.
You knew this about me
and in heaIth.
WeII, this is my sickness!
-What about the obsessive cIeaning?
-That's just good sense.
-You okay?
-No, honey, I'm okay.
Shake it off. Oh, no shaking.
-Mike wins?
I can't beIieve it. I Iost.
-No, you didn't.
-What?
-Because I'm gonna pIay for you.
-You can't do that.
It's okay.
that paddIe home, mister.
-Honey, you don't have to do this.
-Yes, I do.
I may not understand why
you have to win so badIy...
...but if it's important to you,
Sudden death.
-Whoever wins this point, wins.
-Okay.
-Oh, my God. You're good.
-It's Iike watching porn.
And that's how it's done.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-I never sucked. I just didn't want you...
-...to know how good I was.
-Why?
-I don't know.
-WeII, this is so great.
-Now we can enter doubIes tournaments.
-Yeah.
The bartender said they spIit up
into two search parties.
The herbivores and the carnivores.
You know, we, as a group,
are not the cooIest.
Oh, Iook out.
-I don't think they saw us.
they sure don't Iook very carefuIIy.
So I started to teII you something earIier.
There was another reason that I reaIized
it was time to end it with Joey.
I kind of reaIized I was starting
to have feeIings...
...for someone eIse.
And can I ask who?
I think you know.
I think I know too, but I've been reaIIy
-AII right. AII right.
I mean, you just went out
with my best friend, you know?
I just think it wouId be a reaIIy,
reaIIy bad idea.
Or not. I mean--
What?
